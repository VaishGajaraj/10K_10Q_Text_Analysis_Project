      <div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Overview</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing differentiated products to address unmet medical needs. We have proprietary products focused on the treatment of diseases of the
        Central Nervous System, or CNS, including one commercial-product, one commercial-stage product and a late-stage pipeline product candidate. We believe that the characteristics of these patient populations and shortcomings of available treatment
        options create opportunities for the development and commercialization of meaningfully differentiated medicines. In December 2018, we commercially launched the first of our CNS products, Sympazan&#174;<sup style="vertical-align: text-top; line-height: 1; font-size: smaller;">&#160;</sup>(clobazam) Oral Film, for use as an
        adjunctive therapy for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, or LGS, in patients two years and older. In November 2019, we received FDA approval of our product, Exservan&#174;, which has been licensed for European marketing and for which we
        are seeking a licensee in the U.S.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our most advanced proprietary product is Libervant&#8482; (diazepam) Buccal Film.&#160; Libervant is a buccally, or inside of the cheek, administered soluble film formulation of diazepam. Epilepsy patients have
          been underserved for some time with little choice beyond device-based products such as rectally administered gels and a recently approved diazepam nasal spray.&#160; Aquestive is developing Libervant as an alternative to the current standard of care
          rescue therapy for patients with refractory epilepsy, which is a rectal gel, that is invasive, inconvenient, and difficult to administer.&#160; As a result, a large portion of the patient population has not received adequate treatment or foregoes
          treatment altogether.&#160; It is anticipated that Libervant, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), will enable a larger share of these patients to receive more appropriate treatment by providing consistent therapeutic dosing in
          a non-invasive and innovative treatment form for epileptic seizures.&#160; The Company filed an NDA for Libervant in November 2019.&#160; The filing was accepted by the FDA in February 2020 and we have received a PDUFA goal date of September 27, 2020.&#160; On
          January 10, 2020, a competitor of Aquestive obtained FDA approval of its diazepam nasal spray drug candidate and was granted orphan-drug-exclusivity for this drug commencing as of&#160;January 10, 2020.&#160; A company that obtains FDA approval for a
          designated orphan drug receives market exclusivity for that drug for the designated indication for a period of seven years from the grant date in the United States.&#160; This orphan drug exclusivity approval may prevent a subsequent product seeking
          FDA approval from being marketed in the United States during the exclusivity period for the same active moiety for the same orphan drug indication except in the case where the drug candidate sponsor is able to demonstrate, and the FDA concludes,
          that the later drug is &#8220;clinically superior&#8221; to the approved products, e.g., safer, more effective, or providing a major contribution to patient care within the meaning of FDA regulations and guidance.&#160; In assessing whether a drug candidate
          sponsor has demonstrated that its drug candidate provides a &#8220;major contribution to patient care&#8221; over and above the currently approved drugs, which is evaluated by the FDA on a case by case basis, there is no one objective standard and the FDA
          may, in appropriate circumstances, consider such factors as convenience of treatment location, duration of treatment, patient comfort, reduced treatment burden, advances in ease and comfort of drug administration, longer periods between doses,
          and potential for self-administration.&#160; We believe that our product candidate Libervant is &#8220;clinically superior&#8221; to the two currently FDA-approved products with the same moiety and for the same indication as Libervant, as qualifying as &#8220;a major
          contribution to patient care&#8221; within the meaning of the FDA regulation and guidance.&#160; However, such a demonstration to overcome such seven-year market exclusivity is difficult to establish with limited precedents and there can be no assurance
          that we will be successful in these efforts.&#160; Any failure to obtain FDA approval of and to demonstrate clinical superiority for Libervant would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in 2021
          and later.&#160; More details on this product approval are described in &#8220;Competition&#8221; section below in this Item 1. Business of this Form10-K.</div>
      </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have developed a proprietary pipeline of complex molecule products addressing large market opportunities beyond CNS indications, including AQST-108, a sublingual film formulation
        of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis.&#160; In February of 2020, we had a constructive face-to-face pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) application meeting with the FDA for this drug candidate.&#160; A pre-IND meeting provides an opportunity for an
        open communication between a drug sponsor and the FDA to discuss the sponsor&#8217;s IND development plan and to obtain the agency&#8217;s guidance for clinical studies for the sponsor&#8217;s new drug candidate. The FDA has confirmed that the clinical development
        for AQST-108 will be reviewed under the 505(b)(2) pathway as proposed by Aquestive and that no additional studies would be necessary prior to opening the proposed IND application.&#160; The FDA indicated that there appears to be an unmet medical need
        among patients who resist the standard of care use of intramuscular injection in the treatment of anaphylaxis and that AQST-108 may potentially address some of those unmet needs.&#160; Aquestive expects to move forward with opening an IND and initiating
        its pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical trials before the end of 2020.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition to these products and product candidates, we have a portfolio of commercialized and development-stage drug products that we license to other companies. These products include Suboxone&#174;, a
        sublingual film formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone, for the treatment of opioid dependence, and Exservan (riluzole), an oral film product for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</div>

                  to uncertain and inconsistent dosing. These challenges increase the burden of care, particularly for patients that have difficulty swallowing or who may be combative or resistant during treatment administration. We believe that Sympazan
                  addresses these treatment obstacles because it is mucoadhesive, dissolves rapidly and cannot be easily spit out. Following approval by the FDA, we launched Sympazan in December 2018.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are utilizing our technology and know-how to target acceptable market opportunities by developing orally administered complex molecule therapies as alternatives to invasively administered standard of
        care injectable therapeutics. We currently have two active complex molecule programs in clinical development. The first is focused on the oral delivery of the hormone epinephrine. The second is focused on the delivery of a peptide known as
        octreotide. If it achieves regulatory approval, which we cannot assure, octreotide would be the first peptide delivered orally using our technology and may create other opportunities for peptides and biologics.</div>
      <div><br>

        treatment of anaphylaxis using Aquestive&#8217;s proprietary PharmFilm&#174; technologies.&#160; Epinephrine is the standard of care in the treatment of anaphylaxis and is currently administered via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. The current market
        leader is EpiPen&#174;, a single-dose, pre-filled automatic injection device. As a result of its administration via subcutaneous or intra-muscular injection, many patients and their caregivers are reluctant to use currently available products, resulting
        in increased hospital visits and overall cost of care to treat anaphylactic events. The data from a completed Phase 1 dose escalation study demonstrated that AQST-108 achieved similar ranges of mean values of maximum concentration (Cmax) and time
        to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) to that reported for injectables EpiPen&#174; and Auvi-Q&#174;, provided a greater total exposure (AUC0-t; area under the curve) than that reported for EpiPen and Auvi-Q, had less interpatient variability when compared
        to degree of variation (CV%) data reported for EpiPen and Auvi-Q, and was well tolerated, with no study participants discontinuing participation due to an adverse event. We believe that, as a result of its sublingual administration, AQST-108 will
        improve patient compliance and lower the total cost of care. After a constructive pre-IND meeting with the FDA in early February 2020, the Company is in the process of preparing the IND for AQST-108, which is expected to be submitted to the FDA in
        the coming months.&#160; The Company expects to utilize the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway for AQST-108 and expects to begin clinical trials later in 2020.</div>

          somatostatin, for the treatment of acromegaly, as well as severe diarrhea and flushing associated with carcinoid syndrome.&#160; Acromegaly is a hormone disorder that results from the overproduction of growth hormone in middle-aged adults.&#160; Octreotide
          is the standard of care for the treatment of acromegaly.&#160; The current market leader, Sandostatin<sup style="vertical-align: text-top; line-height: 1; font-size: smaller;">&#174;</sup>, is administered via deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections once a month.&#160; This monthly treatment regimen can result in loss of
          efficacy toward the end of the monthly treatment cycle.&#160; We are developing AQST-305 as a non-invasive, pain-free alternative to Sandostatin to reduce treatment burden, healthcare costs and the potential loss of efficacy of the treatment cycle.&#160;
          ASQST-305 has shown promising preclinical results.&#160; We completed a human proof of concept study in Canada. As a result of the early stage proof of concept work, further optimization of this formulation is currently underway.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are a patient-centric pharmaceutical company developing and commercializing products that address unmet needs and improve the lives of patients and their caregivers. We focus on developing medicines
        for patient populations suffering from the shortcomings of available treatment options, which can create an opportunity for differentiated medicines. Our pipeline is initially focused on developing treatments for CNS diseases, as well as orally
        administered complex molecules that we believe can be alternatives to invasively administered standard of care therapies. Our strategy leverages our global intellectual property portfolio, know-how, demonstrated research and development
        capabilities and proprietary manufacturing platform.</div>

                    treatment challenges associated with epilepsy and ALS. We have received FDA approval and subsequently began, in December 2018, distribution and sales of Sympazan. We received FDA approval of Exservan in November 2019.&#160; We completed the
                    rolling submission for our NDA filing with the FDA for our drug candidate Libervant, with a PDUFA goal date of September 27, 2020. A competitor was approved for a diazepam nasal product in January 2020 and was granted orphan
                    exclusivity. As described in more detail above under &#8220;Our Product Portfolio and Pipeline&#8221; and below under &#8220;Competition&#8221;, we believe and intend to seek to demonstrate to the FDA that our product candidate Libervant is clinically superior
                    to the two existing approved products utilizing the same active moiety in that it represents a major contribution to patient care when compared to device driven rectal and nasal applications, although there can be no assurances that we
                    will be successful. See additional information concerning the Libervant FDA approval process in the &#8220;Competition&#8221; section of Item 1. Business of this Form-10K.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Epilepsy treatment regimens typically consist of chronic and acute management therapies. Chronic medicines are used on a daily basis to suppress seizure activity. Approximately 1.2 million of those 3.4
        million people suffering from epilepsy will continue to suffer with breakthrough seizures and may require an acute (rescue) management strategy. Patients are routinely prescribed antiepileptic drugs, or AEDs, as &#8220;maintenance&#8221; therapy to control
        chronic seizure activity. Most AEDs specifically target neuronal excitation or neuronal inhibitory pathways. There are currently more than 20 AEDs approved for use in the United States, and therapeutic choice depends on the epileptic syndrome being
        considered. Patients are routinely prescribed benzodiazepines as &#8220;rescue&#8221; therapy for the management of acute seizure emergencies.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Rescue therapies are administered as needed in the event of an acute seizure to rapidly terminate seizure activity. One of the most effective benzodiazepines currently available for the treatment of
        acute seizures is diazepam. Diazepam is currently marketed as a product administered rectally, and a recently approved nasal spray product which is not yet available commercially. Historically, the rectal gel has been the only rescue medication
        available on the market.&#160; Although the rectal gel has been the preferred drug prescribed by physicians, its rectal administration presents a particular challenge for patients. As a result, only approximately 100,000 patients out of 1.2 million
        potential patients who could benefit from this treatment currently use this therapy. The remaining sufferers either pursue less effective treatments or forego treatment altogether. We have been developing Libervant to reduce the burden associated
        with this rescue therapy.&#160; See &#8220;Our Product Portfolio and Pipeline&#8221; above and &#8220;Competition&#8221; below in this Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning the Libervant FDA approval process and market access issues.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">There are multiple epileptic syndromes including LGS, which is a rare, intractable form of epilepsy and affects approximately 48,000 patients in the United States. Patients with LGS are often drug
        resistant, predisposing them to recurrent seizures, and are typically prescribed a combination of antiepileptic medications, which often includes clobazam. Clobazam (branded name Onfi) is available in both a tablet and suspension formulation.&#160;
        Generic versions of the clobazam tablet and suspension formulation are available to patients as well. Clobazam generated combined sales revenue of $336 million with more than 603,000 prescriptions filled in 2019. Sympazan was developed to reduce
        the burden associated with drug administration and cost.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. Patients suffering from ALS have progressive degeneration of motor neurons,
        which ultimately leads to death, primarily due to respiratory failure. Diagnosis of ALS typically occurs between the ages of 40 and 60, with more than 15,000 patients living with ALS in the U.S.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">There are currently no treatments available that reverse the damage caused by ALS. However, there are two treatment molecules that have been shown to slow disease progression, riluzole, marketed as
        Rilutek or Tiglutik, and edaravone marketed as Radicava.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition to therapeutics aimed at slowing disease progression, patients are often prescribed multiple medications and receive additional therapies, including breathing care, physical therapy,
        occupational therapy, speech therapy, nutritional support, and psychological and social support, to ease the burden of the disease.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">As a result of the degenerative muscle function associated with ALS, patients eventually lose the ability to swallow. Because riluzole may slow disease progression and delay the need for a tracheotomy,
        dysphagia represents a barrier to treatment for many of these patients. We developed Exservan to allow patients to remain on riluzole therapy for more extended periods of time, delaying the need for procedures like tracheotomies, prolonging the
        quality of life for those patients and lowering the overall cost of treatment.&#160; Exservan is approved for marketing in the U.S., and the Company is seeking a marketing licensee for this product in the U.S.&#160; Exservan has been licensed to Zambon for
        marketing in the EU.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition to products to treat CNS conditions, we are developing a number of product candidates in other therapeutic areas, such as anaphylaxis and acromegaly to address those unmet needs.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Anaphylaxis</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Anaphylaxis is a systemic allergic reaction caused by a wide range of allergen exposure, estimated to affect one in 50 people in the United States. Anaphylaxis typically occurs quickly once allergen
        exposure has occurred and, if untreated, can lead to death via airway restriction.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Treatment of anaphylaxis typically consists of an intramuscular injection of epinephrine administered at the earliest opportunity, followed by additional intramuscular or intravenous injections as
        needed. While generic versions of epinephrine are currently available, they are provided as a vial of medication administered via syringes, as well as several auto-injector products. A branded form of epinephrine known as the EpiPen, which utilizes
        a proprietary auto-injector device administered through a deep intramuscular injection, dominates the market. In addition, in the past, manufacturing issues that resulted in injector malfunctions had led to patient concern regarding the reliability
        of auto-injectors.&#160; EpiPen, which is marketed by Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., represents over 70% of the current branded market on a prescription volume basis. Proper dosing and the ability to effectively administer epinephrine in a timely,
        reliable manner is critical for patients experiencing anaphylaxis as well as other acute allergic reactions. However, we believe that the inability to administer complex molecules via oral administration has limited the development of treatments
        that have the potential to provide significant patient benefit. We designed AQST-108, a &#8220;first of its kind&#8221; oral sublingual film formulation delivering systemic epinephrine that is in development for the treatment of anaphylaxis using Aquestive&#8217;s
        proprietary PharmFilm&#174; technologies, to offer a more convenient and cost-effective oral form of epinephrine as an alternative to the current standard of care.&#160; We expect to open an IND with the U.S. FDA in mid-2020 to continue to pursue the
        development and approval of this product under the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Acromegaly is a hormone disorder that results from the overproduction of growth hormone in middle-aged adults. The condition is typically caused by a benign tumor present in the pituitary gland that
        excretes excessive amounts of growth hormone and leads to exaggerated bone growth over time. Due to the gradual progression of the disorder, patients are often not diagnosed for years. The prevalence of acromegaly is estimated to be 77cases per
        million people, indicating approximately 25,000 diagnosed patients within the United States.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Depending on the placement and size of the tumor, patients may be eligible for endoscopic trans nasal transsphenoidal surgery, a procedure in which pituitary tumors are removed through the nose and
        sphenoid sinus. However, surgeons may be unable to completely remove the tumor, leading to persistently elevated growth hormone levels post-surgery. The standard of care for post-surgery patients includes the use of somatostatin analogues to lower
        production or block the action of growth hormones. The somatostatin analogues currently available, octreotide and lanreotide, are administered by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections once a month, or subcutaneous injections three times
        daily.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The market leading product for acromegaly is octreotide, which is marketed as Sandostatin LAR by Novartis, and is administered monthly via depot injections.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Ease of administration has been identified as an unmet patient need within this market, with at least one other company pursing an oral formulation of octreotide. Our PharmFilm&#174; formulation has the
        potential to reduce treatment burden and healthcare costs for patients and improve clinical differentiation.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Libervant&#8482; is a buccally, or inside of the check, administered soluble film formulation of diazepam.&#160; Epilepsy patients have been underserved for some time with little choice beyond device-based
          products such as rectally administered gels and a recently approved diazepam nasal spray.&#160; As an early administered buccal film product that quickly dissolves when applied to the buccal mucosa, Libervant has a rapid onset of action and provides a
          consistent therapeutic dosing. See &#8220;Our Product Portfolio and Pipeline&#8221; above and &#8220;Competition&#8221; below.</div>
      </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are developing Libervant, which has been designated an orphan drug and received a PDUFA goal date of September 27, 2020, as an alternative to currently approved diazepam products in the form of a
          rectal gel and a recently approved nasal spray, the latter of which received orphan drug market exclusivity for this drug. It is anticipated that Libervant, if approved by the FDA, will enable a portion of the patient population who do not
          receive adequate treatment or forego treatment altogether to receive an alternative treatment by providing consistent therapeutic dosing in a non-invasive and innovative treatment form for epileptic seizures.&#160; As a first oral product available
          utilizing this active moiety for this indication, we believe, and we intend to seek to demonstrate to the FDA that, Libervant is clinically superior in that it represents a major contribution to patient care for this group of patients within the
          meaning of the FDA regulations and guidance.&#160; The FDA has recently indicated that, when evaluating clinical superiority for drugs demonstrating a &#8220;major contribution to patient care,&#8221; it may consider, where appropriate, such factors as
          convenience of treatment location, duration of drug administration, longer periods between doses, and potential for self-administration. On January 10, 2020, a competitor of Aquestive obtained FDA approval of its diazepam nasal spray drug
          candidate and was granted orphan-drug-exclusivity for this drug commencing as of&#160;January 10, 2020.&#160; A company that obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug receives orphan market exclusivity for that drug for the designated indication
          for a period of seven years from the grant date in the United States.&#160; This orphan drug exclusivity approval may prevent a subsequent product seeking FDA approval from being marketed in the United States during the exclusivity period for the same
          active moiety for the same orphan drug indication except in the case where the drug candidate sponsor is able to demonstrate, and the FDA concludes, that the later drug is &#8220;clinically superior&#8221; to the approved products, e.g., safer, more
          effective, or providing a major contribution to patient care within the meaning of FDA regulations and guidance.&#160; In assessing whether a drug candidate sponsor has demonstrated that its drug candidate provides a &#8220;major contribution to patient
          care&#8221; over and above the currently approved drugs, which is evaluated by the FDA on a case by case basis, there is no one objective standard and the FDA may, in appropriate circumstances, consider such factors as convenience of treatment
          location, duration of treatment, patient comfort, reduced treatment burden, advances in ease and comfort of drug administration, longer periods between doses, and potential for self-administration.&#160; We believe that our product candidate Libervant
          is &#8220;clinically superior&#8221; to the two currently FDA-approved products with the same moiety and for the same indication as Libervant, as qualifying as &#8220;a major contribution to patient care&#8221; within the meaning of the FDA regulation and guidance.&#160;
          However, such a demonstration to overcome such seven-year market exclusivity is difficult to establish with limited precedents and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.&#160; Any failure to obtain FDA approval of and
          to demonstrate clinical superiority for Libervant would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in 2021 and later.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic allergic reaction that can be triggered by certain foods, insect stings, certain medications and latex, among other allergens. Signs and
        symptoms of anaphylaxis typically occur within seconds or minutes of exposure and may include low blood pressure, skin rash or itching, constriction of the airway and difficulty breathing and nausea and vomiting. If not treated immediately,
        anaphylaxis can lead to death due to airway restriction or cardiac arrest. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening systemic allergic reaction, with an estimated incidence of 50 to 112 episodes per 100,000 people per year. The frequency of
        hospital admissions for anaphylaxis has increased 500-700% in the last 10-15 years. The most common causes of reactions that can include anaphylaxis are medications, foods (such as peanuts), and venom from insect stings. Epinephrine injection is
        the current standard of treatment intended to reverse the potentially severe manifestation of anaphylaxis, which may include red rash, throat swelling, respiratory problems, gastrointestinal distress and loss of consciousness.&#160; Epinephrine, a
        non-selective adrenergic agonist, is administered via intramuscular injection. Because anaphylaxis can progress quickly, the ability to administer a reliable and accurate dose of epinephrine as quickly as possible following a reaction is critical
        for patient recovery and survival. Epinephrine is typically administered in a single-dose, pre-filled automatic injection device, or an auto-injector. People with known allergies and who are at risk for anaphylaxis are advised to carry an
        auto-injector with them at all times and self-administer at the first signs of an anaphylactic reaction. The EpiPen&#174; and similar products can be inconvenient to transport and many patients and caregivers dislike injections as a delivery method.
        Additionally, injector malfunction issues and user administration errors may prevent successful and timely dosing which can result in danger to patients. </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are developing AQST-108, a &#8220;first of its kind&#8221; oral sublingual film formulation delivering systemic epinephrine that is in development for the treatment of anaphylaxis using Aquestive&#8217;s proprietary
        PharmFilm&#174; technologies, as an alternative to the currently marketed intramuscular injections. We believe there is a market opportunity for a non-injectable, easier to administer product with a fast onset of action. A product with this profile
        would enable patients to conveniently and rapidly self-administer a reliable and accurate dose of epinephrine during an anaphylactic reaction, which we believe would result in greater patient compliance. Subject to our achieving regulatory approval
        of this product candidate, which we cannot assure, we believe AQST-108 has the potential to reduce the treatment burden currently associated with intramuscular injections and may lower costs to the healthcare system associated with anaphylaxis,
        such as hospitalizations, due to inaccurate or untimely dosing.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have conducted proof-of-concept studies to demonstrate our ability to deliver epinephrine via a non-invasive sublingual film. The data from our completed Phase 1 dose escalation study demonstrated
        that AQST-108 achieved similar ranges of mean values of maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) to that reported for injectables EpiPen and Auvi-Q&#174;, provided a greater total exposure (AUC0-t; area under the
        curve) than that reported for EpiPen and Auvi-Q, had less interpatient variability when compared to degree of variation (CV%) data reported for EpiPen and Auvi-Q, and was well tolerated, with no study participants discontinuing participation due to
        an adverse event. We believe that this proof of concept study in humans demonstrates our ability to deliver epinephrine via the oral cavity.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In February of 2020, we had a constructive face-to-face pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) application meeting with the FDA.&#160; A pre-IND meeting provides an opportunity for an open
        communication between a drug sponsor and the FDA to discuss the sponsor&#8217;s IND development plan and to obtain the agency&#8217;s guidance for clinical studies for the sponsor&#8217;s new drug candidate. The FDA has confirmed that the clinical development for
        AQST-108 will be reviewed under the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, as proposed by Aquestive, and that no additional studies would be necessary prior to opening the proposed IND application.&#160; The FDA indicated that there appears to be an
        unmet medical need among patients who resist the standard of care use of intramuscular injection in the treatment of anaphylaxis and that AQST-108 may potentially address some of those unmet needs.&#160; Aquestive expects to move forward with opening an
        IND and initiating its pharmacokinetic (PK) clinical trials before the end of 2020.</div>

      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">AQST-305 (Octreotide)</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">AQST-305 is a sublingual film formulation of octreotide, an 8 amino acid peptide that has a similar pharmacological profile to natural somatostatin, for the treatment of acromegaly. We completed human
        proof of concept studies in Canada in 2019 and, based on the results of these studies, we are completing additional reengineering of the formulation.</div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;"> <br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Acromegaly is a hormone disorder that results from the overproduction of growth hormone in middle-aged adults. The condition is typically caused by a benign tumor present in the pituitary gland that
        excretes excessive amounts of growth hormone and leads to exaggerated bone growth over time.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">First-line treatment of acromegaly usually involves surgery to remove the tumor. Some patients are not eligible for surgery depending on the placement and size of the tumor and, in some cases, surgery
        does not completely remove the tumor, leading to persistently elevated growth hormone levels. The standard of care for post-surgery patients includes the chronic use of somatostatin analogues to lower production or block the action of growth
        hormones. The somatostatin analogues currently on the market, octreotide and lanreotide, are administered by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections once a month, which are invasive and painful and can represent a treatment burden for
        patients. Such treatment burdens associated with the somatostatin analogues currently on the market include injection site reactions, sub-optimal symptom control and adverse emotional impact.&#160;&#160; We believe there is a market opportunity for a
        non-injectable, easier to administer product that delivers a reliable and consistent dose of octreotide.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have designed AQST-305 for twice daily administration, which we believe will reduce the burden of monthly depot intramuscular injections and address the potential loss of efficacy over the treatment
        life cycle with currently marketed products. AQST-305 can be administered by the patient, rather than having to receive monthly injections in a physician&#8217;s office. Additionally, because AQST-305 is administered twice-daily, we believe patients
        would receive a consistent dose of octreotide and will not need to be concerned with the potential loss of efficacy that may otherwise result when receiving only a monthly dosage administered via injection. Subject to our achieving FDA approval of
        this product candidate, which we cannot assure, we believe AQST-305 will reduce the burden for patients who are looking for a non-invasive, pain-free, easier to administer product.</div>

        opioid addiction. Suboxone reduces the potential for abuse and improves safety, clinical differentiation, dissolution, taste and texture for patients suffering from opioid addiction. According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, drug
        overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, with opioid addiction driving this epidemic. Opioid dependence is estimated to affect several million people in the United States. Patients overcoming opioid addiction can
        experience painful withdrawal symptoms, which can be mitigated with the use of opioid antagonists.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Suboxone Sublingual Film was launched in partnership with Indivior in 2010 to treat opioid dependence pursuant to a commercialization agreement. We have granted Indivior an exclusive worldwide license
        to this product. Since the launch of the product in 2010, over 2.2 billion doses have been delivered to patients. We are the sole and exclusive manufacturer of Suboxone Sublingual Film worldwide for Indivior. See &#8220;Material Agreements &#8211; Commercial
        Exploitation Agreement with Indivior&#8221; section in this Form 10-K.&#160; On February 20, 2019, Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Labs and Alvogen, Inc. launched competing generic formulations of this product and, on February 22, 2109, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced its
        launch of a similar generic formulation.&#160; In early 2019 Indivior, through Sandoz Inc., began to market and sell an authorized generic sublingual film product for Suboxone.&#160; On October 15, 2019, Indivior publicly announced the discontinuance of
        production of the authorized generic sublingual film product in order to mitigate the impact from the recent passage of H.R. 438 &#8211; Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extender Act of 2019, which came into effect on October 1, 2019 and
        which includes changes to the methodology for calculating average manufacture price branded drugs.&#160; In addition, although Indivior, through the branded Suboxone, has continued to retain significant market share, we have continued to anticipate the
        erosion of this sunsetting product over time.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Zuplenz is an oral soluble film formulation of ondansetron, a 5-HT<sub style="vertical-align: bottom; line-height: 1; font-size: smaller;">3</sub> antagonist approved for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and post-operative recovery.
        Ondansetron is available as intravenous injections, intramuscular injections, orally dissolving tablets, oral solution, tablets, and film. Generic and branded products are available, with the branded product marketed as Zofran by GlaxoSmithKline.
        We licensed commercial rights for Zuplenz to Fortovia (formerly Midatech Pharma PLC) in the United States, Canada, and China. Fortovia launched Zuplenz in the United States in 2015. We are the sole and exclusive manufacturer of Zuplenz for
        Fortovia.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">APL-130277 is a sublingual film using apomorphine, a dopamine agonist indicated as an intermittent therapy to overcome episodic off periods in Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Parkinson&#8217;s disease affects
        approximately 650,000 people in the United States aged greater than 45 years old. APL-130277 is designed to address an unmet need in patients who suffer from dysphagia and/or patients who have discontinued or avoided use of the existing injectable
        product due to site irritation. We licensed intellectual property rights for PharmFilm&#174; technology associated with APL-130277 to Cynapsus Therapeutics, Inc., which was acquired by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sunovion). Subject to receiving FDA
        approval, which we cannot assure, we will earn royalties and other milestone payments contingent upon worldwide sales of APL-130277. See &#8220;Material Agreements &#8211; License Agreement with Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8221; in this Form 10-K.&#160; In January
        2019, we learned that Sunovion received a Complete Response Letter (a CRL) from the FDA in response to its submission of an NDA for APL-130277. In a subsequent press release, Sunovion advised that additional information and analyses were required,
        but that no new clinical studies were required. In the 2019 fourth quarter, Sunovion announced that the FDA had given a PDUFA goal date of May 21, 2020 after a resubmission of the NDA for this product. Assuming FDA approval for this product
        candidate, we intend to explore royalty monetization opportunities for the expected royalty and milestone revenue streams from this product which, if successful, could lead to additional non-dilutive capital for the Company.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We operate two redundant manufacturing and primary packaging facilities located in Portage, Indiana, where we currently manufacture proprietary CNS products, as well as our licensed products, Suboxone
        and Zuplenz, on an exclusive basis. These facilities are expected to have a combined capacity to accommodate the production of our proprietary and licensed products, as well as our pipeline product candidates, without any current need for
        additional infrastructure.&#160; We will continue to consider our anticipated facilities and infrastructure needs as our product development grows. We have produced over 1.1 billion doses in the last four years. As a company, our research and
        development laboratories are registered with the DEA for Schedule II-V drugs.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are subject to various regulatory requirements, such as the regulations of the FDA, the DEA, and other foreign health authorities such as the Australian Government Department of Health&#8217;s Therapeutics
        Goods Administration, or TGA. We are required to register our facilities and adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) standards. These standards require manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and
        other quality assurance procedures throughout the entire manufacturing process. Our facilities have undergone inspections by the FDA, DEA, TGA, and several quality assurance inspections by pharmaceutical companies for cGMP compliance. In each case,
        the facilities have passed inspection and are subject to periodic re-inspection. Failure to comply with these and other statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters,
        the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product or product complaints must be reported
        and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy
        of the product occur following approval.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We purchase our raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, from qualified, approved vendors both domestically and internationally. While we typically source raw materials from the
        lowest cost provider whenever possible, we continue to pursue a multi-supplier strategy for all of our critical raw materials, where available or appropriate. Our product packaging foil is supplied by a single manufacturer. Such manufacturer
        utilizes multiple manufacturing facilities for production of our packaging foil. We may enter into more formal supply agreements in the future as production volumes increase and are more predictive.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Subject to the supervision of our internal clinical development staff, we use third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, to administer and conduct many aspects of our planned clinical trials
        including monitoring and managing data, and we will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols. We intend for such CROs to play a
        significant role in the subsequent collection and analysis of data from such trials.&#160; Additionally, we intend to continue to outsource secondary packaging and third-party logistics for our proprietary products.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that develop and commercialize therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of disease areas and indications. Additionally, we compete with
        companies that utilize advanced drug administration platforms, such as oral, injectable, intranasal, transdermal patch and pulmonary delivery, to create improved therapeutics over current standards of care. This industry is highly competitive and
        new products and technologies evolve and come to market at a rapid pace. The companies operating in this market include multinational organizations, established biotechnology companies, single product pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,
        specialty pharmaceutical companies, and generic drug companies. Many of the larger, established organizations currently have commercialization capabilities in-house, and may have partnership or license agreements in place with smaller companies for
        commercialization rights. These companies may develop new drugs to treat the indications that we target or seek to have existing drugs approved for the treatment of the indications that we target.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We will compete with commercialized products in all markets for which we have approval and are seeking approval.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid evolution and advancements of technologies, intense competition and strong defense of intellectual property.&#160; Any products and
        product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.&#160; Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other
        therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any companion diagnostics.&#160; The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other
        third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">On January 10, 2020, a competitor of Aquestive obtained FDA approval of its diazepam nasal spray drug candidate and was granted orphan-drug-exclusivity for this drug commencing as of&#160;January 10,
          2020.&#160; A company that obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug receives orphan market exclusivity for that drug for the designated indication for a period of seven years from the grant date in the United States.&#160; This orphan drug
          exclusivity approval prevents a subsequent product seeking FDA approval from being marketed in the United States during the exclusivity period for the same active moiety for the same orphan drug indication except in the case where the drug
          candidate sponsor is able to demonstrate, and the FDA concludes, that the later drug is &#8220;clinically superior&#8221; to the approved products, e.g., safer, more effective, or providing a major contribution to patient care within the meaning of FDA
          regulations and guidance.&#160; In assessing whether a drug candidate sponsor has demonstrated that its drug candidate provides a &#8220;major contribution to patient care&#8221; over and above the currently approved drugs, which is evaluated by the FDA on a case
          by case basis, there is no one objective standard and the FDA may, in appropriate circumstances, consider such factors as convenience of treatment location, duration of treatment, patient comfort, reduced treatment burden, advances in ease and
          comfort of drug administration, longer periods between doses, and potential for self-administration.&#160; We believe, and intend to seek to demonstrate to the FDA, that our product candidate Libervant is &#8220;clinically superior&#8221; to the two currently
          FDA-approved products with the same moiety and for the same indication as Libervant, as qualifying as &#8220;a major contribution to patient care&#8221; within the meaning of the FDA regulation and guidance.&#160; However, such a demonstration to overcome such
          seven-year market exclusivity is difficult to establish with limited precedents and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.&#160; Any failure to obtain FDA approval of and to demonstrate clinical superiority for
          Libervant would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in 2021 and later.</div>

      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Commercial Exploitation Agreement with Indivior</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In August 2008, we entered into a Commercial Exploitation Agreement with Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or the Indivior License Agreement. Indivior, Inc. is the successor in interest to
        Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Pursuant to the Indivior License Agreement, we have agreed to manufacture and supply Indivior&#8217;s requirements of Suboxone for both United States and international markets on an exclusive basis.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Under the terms of the Indivior License Agreement, we are required to manufacture Suboxone in accordance with cGMP standards and according to the specifications and processes set forth in the related
        quality agreements with Indivior. Additionally, we are required to obtain API for the manufacture of Suboxone directly from Indivior. The Indivior License Agreement specifies a minimum annual threshold quantity of Suboxone that we are obligated to
        fill and requires Indivior to provide us with a forecast of its requirements at various specified times throughout the year.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Indivior License Agreement provides for payment by Indivior of a purchase price per unit that is subject to adjustment based on our ability to satisfy minimum product thresholds. Additionally, in
        the event Indivior purchases certain large quantities of Suboxone during a specified period, Indivior will be entitled to scaled rebates on its purchases.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition to the purchase price for the Suboxone supplied, under the Indivior License Agreement, we are to be paid low single digit percentage royalty payments tied to net sales value, subject to
        annual maximum amounts and limited to the life of related United States or international patents. Indivior exercised its right to buy out its future royalty obligations based on sales in the United States in 2012. Indivior remains obligated to pay
        royalties for all sales outside the United States.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Indivior License Agreement contains customary contractual termination provisions in the event of bankruptcy or corporate dissolution, the intellectual property surrounding Suboxone is found to be
        invalid, or either party commits a material breach of the Indivior License Agreement. Additionally, Indivior may terminate the Indivior License Agreement if the FDA or other applicable regulatory authority declares our manufacturing site to no
        longer be suitable for the manufacture of Suboxone or Suboxone is no longer suitable to be manufactured due to health or safety reasons. The initial term of the Indivior License Agreement was seven years from the commencement date. Thereafter, the
        Indivior License Agreement has automatically renewed for successive one-year periods. One-year renewals are expected to continue in the absence of Indivior&#8217;s written notice of its intent not to renew at least one year prior to the expiration of any
        prior renewal term.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Supplemental Agreement with Indivior</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">On September 24, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Indivior, or the Indivior Supplemental Agreement. Pursuant to the Indivior Supplemental Agreement, we conveyed to Indivior all of our existing
        and future rights in the settlement of various ongoing patent enforcement legal actions and disputes related to the Suboxone product. We also conveyed to Indivior the right to sublicense manufacturing and marketing capabilities to enable an
        Indivior licensed generic buprenorphine product to be produced and sold by parties unrelated to Indivior or us. Under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement, we are entitled to receive certain payments from Indivior commencing on the date of the
        agreement through January 1, 2023. Once paid, all payments made under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement are non-refundable. Through February 20, 2019, the date of launch of the competing generics of Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Labs and Alvogen, we received an
        aggregate of $40.75 million from Indivior under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement. Further payments under this agreement are suspended until adjudication of related patent infringement litigation occurs. If such litigation is successful, in
        addition to the amounts already received as described in the foregoing, we may receive up to an additional $34.25 million consisting of (i) up to $33.0 million in the aggregate from any combination of (a) performance or event-based milestone
        payments and (b) single digit percentage royalties on net revenue earned by Indivior on sales of Suboxone and (ii) the additional $1.25 million that was earned through the issuance of additional process patent rights to us. The aggregate payments
        under this Indivior Supplemental Agreement are capped at $75.0 million.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">All payments made by Indivior to us pursuant to the Indivior Supplemental Agreement are in addition to, and not in place of, any amounts owed by Indivior to us pursuant to the Indivior License
        Agreement. Indivior&#8217;s payment obligations under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement are subject to certain factors affecting the market for Suboxone and may terminate prior to January 1, 2023 in the event certain contingencies relating to such
        market occur.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In April 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. (which was later succeeded to in interest by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc, or Sunovion), referred to as the Sunovion
        License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Sunovion an exclusive, worldwide license (with the right to sub-license) to certain intellectual property, including existing and future patents and patent applications, covering all oral films
        containing APL-130277 (apomorphine) for the treatment of off episodes in Parkinson&#8217;s disease patients, as well as two other fields. Our licensee, Sunovion, as sponsor of APL-130277, submitted an NDA to the FDA on March 29, 2018; on the PDUFA date
        in January 2019, Sunovion received a CRL. In the 2019 fourth quarter, Sunovion announced that it had received a PDUFA goal date of May 21, 2020 after the resubmission of its NDA.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In consideration of the rights granted to Sunovion under the Sunovion License Agreement, we received aggregate payments totaling $18.0 million to date. In addition to the upfront payment of $5.0 million
        we have also earned an aggregate of $13.0 million in connection with specified regulatory and development milestones in the United States and Europe (the &#8220;Initial Milestone Payments&#8221;), all of which of which has been received to date. We are also
        entitled to receive certain contingent one-time milestone payments related to product availability and regulatory approval in the United States and Europe, certain one-time milestone payments based on the achievement of specific annual net sales
        thresholds of APL-130277, and ongoing mid-single digit percentage royalty payments related to the net sales of APL-130277 (subject to reduction to low-single digit percentage royalty payments in certain circumstances), subject to certain minimum
        payments. The maximum aggregate milestone payments that may be paid to us pursuant to the Sunovion License Agreement is equal to $45.0 million. With the exception of the Initial Milestone Payments, there can be no guarantee that any such milestones
        will in fact be met or payable. This Sunovion License Agreement will continue until terminated by us or Sunovion in accordance with the termination provisions of the Sunovion License Agreement.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">As more fully described in the Sunovion License Agreement, we may terminate the Sunovion License Agreement if (i) Sunovion fails to make any payments required under the Sunovion License Agreement when
        due and after receiving certain notices from us; (ii) Sunovion fails to commercialize APL-130277 in at least one Major Market (as defined in the Sunovion License Agreement) by January 1, 2020; (iii) Sunovion pays us not more than the minimum
        royalty payment due for any 30 consecutive months from the date of first commercial sale; (iv) Sunovion fails a primary endpoint of its Phase 3 studies (CTH-300 and CTH-301) and either fails to start another Phase 3 study within six months after
        such failed primary endpoint, or fails a primary endpoint of any subsequent Phase 3 study; (v) Sunovion publicly challenges the validity or enforceability of the Licensed Patents (as defined in the Agreement); or (vi) no further royalty payments
        are due and payable to us.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">As more fully described in the Sunovion License Agreement, Sunovion generally may terminate the Sunovion License Agreement if (i) we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to defend the Licensed
        Patents in response to a Patent Infringement Claim (as defined in the Sunovion License Agreement); (ii) we are in material breach of the Sunovion License Agreement, which breach is not remedied after receiving notice thereof; (iii) prior to
        commercialization of APL-130277, upon certain notice to us, if Sunovion has abandoned further development of APL-130277; or (iv) at any time after December 31, 2024, for any reason upon certain notice to us. Sunovion may also terminate the Sunovion
        License Agreement if it can establish that a Material Decline (as defined in the Agreement) has occurred in a jurisdiction as a result of us licensing to a third-party any Licensed Patents to develop or commercialize apomorphine either alone or in
        combination with another active agent, for any human use, solely with respect to such jurisdiction(s) that have suffered a Material Decline, upon certain notice to us.&#160; Aquestive may terminate the agreement for any reason at any time after January
        1, 2020.</div>
      <div><br>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In March 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with KemPharm, Inc., or KemPharm, to terminate a Collaboration and License Agreement entered into in April 2011. Under this termination arrangement,
        we have the right to participate in any and all value that KemPharm may derive from the commercialization or any other monetization of KP 415 and KP 484 compounds or their derivatives. Among these monetization transactions are those related to any
        business combinations involving KemPharm and collaborations, royalty arrangements, or other transactions from which KemPharm may realize value from these compounds. During September 2019, the Company received $1.0 million from its 10% share of
        milestone payments paid to KemPharm under its licensing of KP-415 and KP-484.&#160; There can be no guarantee that such payments will be made in the future.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We currently seek, and intend to continue seeking, patent protection whenever commercially reasonable for any patentable aspects of our product candidates and related technology or any new products or
        product candidates we acquire in the future. Where our intellectual property is not protected by patents, we may seek to protect it through other means, including maintenance of trade secrets and careful protection of our proprietary information.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, we intend to seek orphan drug exclusivity in jurisdictions in which it is available. A prerequisite to orphan drug exclusivity in the United States and in the European Union is orphan drug
        designation. An orphan drug designation may be granted where a drug is developed specifically to treat a rare or uncommon medical condition. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for
        the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in
        certain very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the United States and 10 years in the European Union. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the indication protected
        by exclusivity, or the same drug for a different indication.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our patent portfolio currently comprises at least 200 issued patents worldwide, of which at least 40 are U.S. patents, and more than 90 pending patent applications worldwide. These issued patents and
        pending patent applications provide both process of making and composition of matter protection for our PharmFilm&#174; technology and products and product candidates, including Suboxone and our PharmFilm formulations of tadalafil, diazepam, clobazam,
        riluzole, epinephrine and octreotide. These patents and, if issued as patents, pending patent applications will likely expire between 2022 and 2037. The pending patent applications filed in 2017 will provide composition of matter and process of
        making protection for our PharmFilm&#174; dosage formulations of diazepam, epinephrine and octreotide and, if issued as patents, will likely expire by 2037. The projected expiration dates exclude any patent term adjustment or patent term extension.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our PharmFilm&#174; technology is covered by at least 8 patent families. These patent families provide process, composition of matter protection for our PharmFilm&#174; technology, and comprise at least 50 issued
        patents worldwide, of which at least19 are U.S. patents, and related pending patent applications worldwide. The patents and pending patent applications, if issued as patents, will likely expire between 2022 and 2037, excluding any patent term
        adjustment or patent term extension.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The PharmFilm&#174; technology patents also generically and specifically protect the technology utilized in the products and product candidates in our CNS programs, our Complex Molecule Programs, as well as
        our Partner Programs. For example, encompassed within our platform technology patents is specific coverage directed to PharmFilm dosage formulations of CNS molecules such as diazepam. Also encompassed within our platform technology is coverage for
        our complex molecule program which includes molecules such as epinephrine. Our platform technology patents further cover the products Suboxone and Zuplenz, as well as our formulations of the molecules apomorphine and tadalafil, which are part of
        our partnered programs. The expiration dates for patents covering these products and product candidates, and for pending applications if issued as patents, extend from 2022 to 2037, excluding any patent term adjustment or patent term extension.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We note that several of our issued patents are or have been involved in administrative proceedings, such as reexamination and inter partes review at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and
        opposition at the European Patent Organization, or EPO.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Certain of our patents and patent applications, if granted, will be published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs
        listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA. If any of these potential generic competitors claim that their product
        will not infringe our listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, then they must send notice to us once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the
        notice of the Paragraph IV certification, which would automatically prevent the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case
        that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The rest of our patent portfolio largely relates to patents and applications owned by us and directed to our product development portfolio and other product candidates and related compositions and/or

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements
        upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except
        in specific circumstances, nor used outside the scope of their employment. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our
        business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention provisions.
        Further, we generally require confidentiality agreements from business partners and other third parties that receive our confidential information. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or
        adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations,
        govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of
        pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, clinical holds, warning or
        untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug
        may be marketed in the United States generally involves:</div>

        other conditions. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements, which includes the requirement
        that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of
        certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:</div>

                  to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to
                  demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically
                  persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The
        NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product&#8217;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a
        substantial application user fee, and applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription drug product, which beginning in Fiscal Year 2018 replaced the product and establishment fees.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit
        substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted
        application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain
        performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation, or fast track status, is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a
        treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA endeavors to review applications subject to Standard Review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The FDA may refer applications for proprietary drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation
        as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which
        the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within
        required specifications and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the
        NDA and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the
        regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with
        specific prescribing information for specific indications.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a REMS, or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a
        REMS is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan
        to educate healthcare providers of the drug&#8217;s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain
        circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess whether the REMS plan is effective. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and
        profitability of a drug.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#8217;s safety or efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of
        a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be
        marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including
        labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA
        approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires
        clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Post-Approval Requirements</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration,
        recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion, including standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored
        scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for
        off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label
        uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, quality-control, drug manufacturing, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required
        to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced and announced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing
        facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product
        approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. The FDA may also impose a REMS
        requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug&#8217;s benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, regulatory authorities may take other enforcement
        action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to
        approved applications, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The FDA may require post-approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would
        be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware
        of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, a part of the FDCA. In addition, Title II of
        the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act or the DSCSA, has imposed new &#8220;track and trace&#8221; requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other
        entities in the drug supply chain. These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period. The DSCSA ultimately will require product identifiers (<font style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</font>, serialization) on prescription drug products in
        order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA replaced the prior drug &#8220;pedigree&#8221; requirements under the PDMA and preempts
        existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers. These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing
        requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by the FDA pursuant to the DSCSA. Until the FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA&#8217;s new national
        licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Hatch-Waxman Amendments established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market
        and distribute these drugs is obtained by submitting an ANDA to the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation,
        specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not
        include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a
        generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it
        finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator
        drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">505(b)(2) NDAs</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section
        505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can
        establish that reliance on FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to
        perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the
        branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Orange Book Listing</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents with claims that cover the applicant&#8217;s product. Upon approval of an
        NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA
        referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (ii) such patent has expired; (iii) the date on which such
        patent expires; or (iv) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of
        the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a
        &#8220;section viii&#8221; statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">If the reference drug NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the
        FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the
        applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.</div>

      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Non-Patent Exclusivity</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent related exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot review, or in some cases, approve
        an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a company may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not
        been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An &#8220;active moiety&#8221; is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance&#8217;s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing
        any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA&#8217;s findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the
        follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation
        of a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA
        would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review
        process during the exclusivity period.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or
        biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there
        is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug
        is intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product
        designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation, however, does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Orphan drug designation provides manufacturers with research grants, tax credits and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the
        first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active
        ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan indication for which it received the designation, it will not be
        entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically
        superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than
        one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or
        obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, we may still be subject to competition. Orphan
        exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or
        disease.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare &#8220;fraud and abuse,&#8221; including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False
        Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit,
        receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or
        Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar
        to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services,
        including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable
        under these laws if they are deemed to &#8220;cause&#8221; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities
        relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our
        products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the Federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs.
        Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,000 and $25,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from
        participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the Federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals
        can bring actions under the Federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition to the privacy and security requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
        Act, (which we refer to collectively as HIPAA), HIPPA also expanded and created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other
        things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact
        or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with
        the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">There are also an increasing number of state laws with requirements for manufacturers and/or marketers of pharmaceutical products. Some states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing
        and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals.
        Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justification of price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut,
        Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar
        federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional
        activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state,
        and soon federal, authorities.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are
        reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the previous calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching
        hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, HIPAA, and its implementing regulations impose certain obligations on entities subject to the law, such as health plans and most healthcare providers, and their business associates who
        provide certain services involving the use or disclosure of HIPAA protected health information on their behalf, with respect to the privacy and security of such protected health information. Further, most states have enacted laws governing the
        privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts in certain circumstances, such as specific disease
        states.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Compliance with such laws and regulations will require substantial resources. Because of the breadth of these various fraud and abuse laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be
        subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do
        not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil
        monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity
        agreement or other settlement to resolve allegations of violations of these laws, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, we may be subject to contractual damages and reputational harm as result of such
        non-compliance. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity.</div>

      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">International Regulation</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products.
        Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The
        approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other
        things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining
        regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product
        recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. In the European Union, or EU, we may seek marketing authorization under either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="color: #000000; text-indent: 36pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Centralized procedure</font>. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing
        authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland,
        Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such
        as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of
        submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="color: #000000; text-indent: 36pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">National authorization procedures</font>. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are
        available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous
        authorization in more than one EU country for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is
        first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following a national authorization, the applicant may seek further marketing authorizations from other EU countries under a procedure whereby the
        countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In the EU, medicinal products designated as orphan products benefit from financial incentives such as reductions in marketing authorization application fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market
          exclusivity following medicinal product approval. For a medicinal product to qualify as orphan: (i) it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating; (ii) the
          prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than five in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and (iii) no satisfactory
          method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">United States Healthcare Reform</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs,
        improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, the PPACA, substantially changes the way
        healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes,
        benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, or commonly known as the donut hole, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate
        program, expansion of the Public Health Service&#8217;s 340B drug pricing discount program, or 340B program, fraud and abuse, and enforcement. These changes impact existing government healthcare programs and are resulting in the development of new
        programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs to individuals with an income of up to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the PPACA. For each state that does not
        choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval, business and financial condition. Where new patients receive insurance coverage
        under any of the new Medicaid options made available through the PPACA, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there continue to be judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, some of which have been successful, as
        well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain
        provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress
        has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the
        tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the &#8220;individual mandate&#8221;. Additionally, on January 22,
        2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called &#8220;Cadillac&#8221; tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance
        plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the
        PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the Medicare Part D donut hole. Congress will likely consider
        other legislation to replace elements of the PPACA.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Moreover, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other
        things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals for spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through
        2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative
        amendments, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, in January 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things,
        reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has
        resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient
        programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration&#8217;s budget proposal for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted
        during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid,
        and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a &#8220;Blueprint&#8221;, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase
        drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The
        Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. While some proposed measures
        will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that they will continue to pursue new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs,
        including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation form other countries and bulk purchasing.
        At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on
        certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We expect that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended or replaced in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse
        effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.</div>

      <div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Coverage and Reimbursement</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Payor coverage uncertainty exists for all pharmaceutical products that are launched. This uncertainty exists as to the coverage of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any
        of our products and product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private
        payors, such as commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors determine which drugs they will cover. In the United States, there is no uniform system among payors for making coverage decisions. Decisions regarding
        the extent of coverage for any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on
        what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor&#8217;s formulary, or a payor&#8217;s list of covered drugs, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the
        adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and
        results. A decision by a payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician adoption of our product candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">So that we may secure coverage for our products, if approved for sale, we may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the
        product, in addition to the studies required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Even if we conduct such pharmacoeconomic studies, our products and product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective
        by payors.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We intend to pursue a reasonable and credible approach to the pricing of our products, in order to avoid such products being categorized as specialty products. Determination of responsible pricing will
        be based on the value proposition of our products, a full therapeutic category review, competitive pricing analysis and a strategic review of the payor landscape and payor dynamics. The payor type (business mix), will determine net pricing. Payor
        type by product (<font style="font-style: italic;">e.g.</font>, Medicaid, Medicare, Commercial) will vary and therefore require varying discount levels. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, surveys and publishes retail pharmacy
        acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC, files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates.</div>
      <div><br>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Participation in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program would require us to pay a rebate for each unit of drug reimbursed by Medicaid. The amount of the &#8220;basic&#8221; portion of the rebate for each product is set
        by law as the larger of: (i) 23.1% of quarterly Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP, or (ii) the difference between quarterly AMP and the quarterly best price available from us to any commercial or non-governmental customer, or Best Price. AMP must
        be reported on a monthly and quarterly basis and Best Price is reported on a quarterly basis only. In addition, the rebate also includes the &#8220;additional&#8221; portion, which adjusts the overall rebate amount upward as an &#8220;inflation penalty&#8221; when the
        drug&#8217;s latest quarter&#8217;s AMP exceeds the drug&#8217;s AMP from the first full quarter of sales after launch, adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index-Urban. The upward adjustment in the rebate amount per unit is equal to the excess amount of the
        current AMP over the inflation-adjusted AMP from the first full quarter of sales. The rebate amount is recomputed each quarter based on our report to CMS of current quarterly AMP and Best Price for our drug. The terms of our participation in the
        program would impose a requirement for us to report revisions to AMP or Best Price within a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was originally due. Any such revisions could have the impact of increasing or decreasing
        our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision. This &#8220;inflation penalty&#8221;, also known as the Medicaid CPI Penalty, results from price increases in excess of the Consumer Price Index.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Federal law requires that any manufacturer that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer&#8217;s
        drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B &#8220;ceiling price&#8221; for the manufacturer&#8217;s covered outpatient drugs. These
        340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B
        ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Any changes to the definition of AMP and the Medicaid rebate
        amount under the PPACA or other legislation could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In the United States Medicare program, outpatient prescription drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D is a voluntary prescription drug benefit, through which Medicare beneficiaries
        may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities for coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare
        Advantage plans provided for under Medicare Part C.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Coverage for covered outpatient drugs under Part D is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its
        own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Although Part D prescription drug
        formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, they have some flexibility to establish those categories and classes and are not required to cover all of the drugs in each category or class.
        Medicare Part D prescription drug plans may use formularies to limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class and/or impose differential cost sharing or other utilization management techniques.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The availability of coverage under Medicare Part D may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, in order for the products that we market to be included on the
        formularies of Part D prescription drug plans, we likely will have to offer net pricing that is lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Changes to Medicare Part D that give plans more freedom to limit coverage or manage utilization, and
        other cost reduction initiatives in the program could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could harm our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Pricing and rebate calculations, which vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, third-party intermediaries such as pharmacy benefit
        managers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if a manufacturer is found to have knowingly submitted any false price information to the government or fails to submit the required price data
        on a timely basis. Such conduct also could be grounds for CMS to terminate the manufacturer&#8217;s Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid. In addition, claims submitted to federally funded
        healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for drugs priced based on incorrect pricing data provided by a manufacturer can implicate the federal Civil False Claims Act. In addition, any patient assistance program sponsored by a
        manufacturer must meet strict requirements to avoid running afoul of state or federal anti-kickback laws.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The United States government, state
        legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for
        substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the PPACA expanded manufacturers&#8217; rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed
        care organizations as well, increased the minimum Medicaid rebate due for most innovator drugs, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of AMP. The PPACA and subsequent legislation also changed the definition of AMP. In
        addition, the PPACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs (excluding orphan drugs) to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each such manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded
        prescription drug fee of $42.8 billion in 2019, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. The PPACA also expanded the Public Health Service&#8217;s 340B program to include
        additional types of covered entities. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only
        recently become, effective. It appears likely that the PPACA will continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the PPACA and other healthcare statutes remain possible in the United States Congress and under the Trump administration, as discussed above under the
        heading &#8220;United States Healthcare Reform.&#8221; In addition, there likely will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators, and third-party payors to contain healthcare costs. Thus, even if we obtain
        favorable coverage for any products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies may be implemented in the future.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Additional information regarding these programs is discussed under the heading &#8220;If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for our products or product
        candidates, if approved, their commercial success may be severely hindered&#8221; in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</div>

        connection with our research. While we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental and other regulations, in each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers,
        including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We will need substantial additional capital to fund our operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our operations have consumed and will continue to consume substantial amounts of cash. We had $49,326 in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019.&#160; We currently have no committed sources of
        future funding or capital.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our anticipated revenue from our licensed product activities including expected milestone payments, other co-development payments and
        royalty payments, manufacturing and supply revenues at anticipated levels, sales of our proprietary product at anticipated levels, and assuming satisfaction of all conditions and requirements for further issuances and available purchasers thereof,
        potential additional proceeds from future issuances of up to $30,000 under our 12.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the &#8220;Senior Secured Notes&#8221;),&#160; the net proceeds from our equity issuance in December 2019, potential future monetization of certain
        royalty streams or other license rights for our licensed product Apomorphine (subject to all conditions and requirements under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture dated July 15, 2019) and, if needed and available to us, which cannot be assured,
        further access to the capital markets under our shelf-registration statement filed with the SEC and declared effective September 17, 2019, will be adequate to fund our expected cash requirements for the next 12 months. However, we have based this
        expectation on assumptions that could change or prove to be inaccurate and, additionally, we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we expect.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We continue to be in the process of transitioning to a company newly commercializing its self-developed products, with our commercialization activities beginning with regulatory approval of our first
        proprietary product, Sympazan, in December 2018.&#160; For our commercialization efforts to be successful we must continue to train, deploy and further recruit, contract for and develop an effective sales and marketing organization and infrastructure.&#160;
        To become and remain profitable we must continue to develop, obtain timely regulatory approval of, and successful commercialize or out-licenses or monetize, those of our proprietary products and product candidates that we believe will have the most
        market potential and commercial success.&#160; In addition, our commercialization effects may take longer to achieve than planned.&#160; Our business or operations may also change and we may also encounter unanticipated or unbudgeted events or expenses that
        may require cash resources more rapidly than planned.&#160; We are unable to determine or forecast with certainty when or if we will achieve or sustain profitability.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our cash resources on hand are not sufficient by themselves to fund our expected development, commercialization and other operations and activities, and we will continue to require external resources of
        funding and capital to develop and seek regulatory approval of our product candidates and for the commercialization of our approved products.&#160; The amount of additional funding and capital will depend on many factors, many of which may be beyond our
        control.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to commercialize our epilepsy products, Sympazan (launched in December 2018) and, if approved by the FDA, Libervant, which we cannot assure, and our
        other proprietary product candidates.&#160; We expect our expenses to continue to significantly increase as we continue to devote substantial financial resources to our ongoing product development, research and development activities, pre-clinical
        activities, clinical trials, regulatory approval activities, and commercialization activities.&#160; We also expect to continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future and we therefore are dependent upon external
        financing and funding to achieve our operating plan.&#160; Based on our operating budget and business plan, we will need to raise substantial additional financing by various means, including, among others, through public or private equity or debt
        financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. Our existing resources will not be adequate to permit
        us to complete clinical development of our product candidates or fund our operations and additional resources will be needed to complete such development and to support our continued operations. We will therefore continue to explore a variety of
        funding alternatives, including both dilutive and non-dilutive financing options and strategic partnerships.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our expectation of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate and, additionally, we could
        deplete our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, our operating plan and budget could change as a result of many factors and we may encounter unforeseen or unplanned expenses, difficulties, delays or other
        unforeseen or unplanned factors, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, whether through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other
        collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches, and we cannot assure we will be successful in any of these efforts.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The sufficiency of our short-term and longer-term liquidity is directly impacted by our level of operating revenues and our ability to achieve our operating plan for revenues, regulatory approval in the
        time period planned of our late-stage proprietary products and our ability to monetize in the time period planned our royalty streams or other license rights such as Apomorphine.&#160; We also are entitled to further potential milestones, royalty and
        other payments under our Indivior Supplemental Agreement, which are suspended and may only be reinstated if Indivior successfully adjudicates or settles the related patent infringement litigation, and there is no assurance when or if any such
        payments may be due.&#160; Our operating revenues have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate in the future.&#160; We also have substantial ongoing debt repayment and debt service obligations.&#160; A substantial portion of our current and past
        revenues has been dependent upon our licensing, manufacturing and sales with one customer, Indivior, which is expected to continue while we commercialize our own proprietary products and it could take longer than planned to achieve anticipated
        sales levels of our proprietary products.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have historically relied upon sales of Suboxone and Zuplenz, our two commercialized licensed products, milestone payments and other fees from co-development and research services, fees from licensed
        proprietary technologies and patent rights, and royalties based on specified product sales, together with private sales of equity or debt securities and proceeds from our debt facilities, to fund our operations. Due to the at-risk launch of
        Suboxone generics in the marketplace, as well as the cessation of manufacture and sale of the authorized generic of Suboxone, our revenue will continue to be adversely impacted.&#160; Delays in obtaining funding could adversely affect our ability to
        develop and commercially introduce products, if approved, and cause us to be unable to comply with our obligations. Even if we believe we have sufficient capital and cash resources for our current or expected operating plans, we may seek additional
        capital and cash resources if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations or we otherwise believe it to be advisable. Any additional capital raising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day
        activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our current and future product candidates.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Unless and until we become profitable, we will continue to need to raise additional capital and/or other financing or funding in the future, any of which could be material.&#160; Our ability to secure
        additional equity financing could be significantly impacted by numerous factors including our operating performance and prospects, timely achievement of regulatory approval of our late-stage proprietary products, our existing level of debt which is
        secured by substantially all of our assets, restrictions under our 12.5% Senior Secured Notes Indenture, investor sentiment and general market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in raising equity
        capital or that any such needed financing will be available, available on favorable or acceptable terms or at the times or in the amounts needed.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our ability to obtain additional debt financing is also subject, in addition to the limitations and restrictions under the Indenture for our Senior Secured Notes, to a number of additional factors,
        including market conditions, our operating performance and lender sentiment.&#160; To the extent we are able to obtain needed funding through additional debt financing, any such debt financing may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants
        for our shares, which could also result in dilution to our stockholders.&#160; The incurrence of additional debt would also result in increased fixed payment obligations.&#160; If we were to default on any of our indebtedness, which currently is secured by
        substantially all of our assets, we could lose such assets including our intellectual property.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We also may seek to obtain additional funding in the near future through the monetization of royalty streams from our licensed product Apomorphine, subject to regulatory approval thereof, (and subject
        to the conditions and requirements under the Indenture for our Senior Secured Notes including our note repurchase obligations at the option of the holders), but we cannot be assured of any such royalty streams or monetization.&#160; We also may seek to
        obtain additional funding through third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches.&#160; In addition, payments made by
        potential collaborators or licensors generally will depend upon our achievement of negotiated development and regulatory milestones. Failure to achieve these milestones may harm our future liquidity and funding position.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The first reopener (for up to $10 million) under the Indenture for our Senior Secured Notes is, among other conditions, subject to the completion of the NDA filing for our product candidate Libervant
        and the consent, in their discretion, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes. We have an opportunity to seek additional funding under the Indenture for the Senior Secured Notes if the
        FDA approves the NDA for up to $30 million of our product candidate Libervant. We cannot assure any additional financing under the Indenture for the Senior Secured Notes.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We completed the rolling submission of our NDA filing for Libervant in November 2019, and the FDA accepted our NDA filing on February 10, 2020. Due to FDA approval of and FDA grant of orphan drug
        exclusivity for a competitive product in January 2020, we are required to demonstrate to the FDA, and the FDA would need to conclude, that Libervant is &#8220;clinically superior&#8221; to the two current FDA-approved products with the same active moiety and
        for the same indication as Libervant as qualifying as &#8220;a major contribution to patient care&#8221; within the meaning of the FDA regulations and guidance, which is difficult to establish with limited precedents and we cannot assure that we will be
        successful.&#160; Any delay in obtaining FDA approval to market Libervant in the U.S., or any failure to obtain such approval, would reduce, delay or possibly eliminate a significant revenue source and line of business which has been part of our
        strategy and business plan, which we would need to replace with other proprietary product candidates, which we cannot assure.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We may not be able to raise additional capital or other funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and any failure to raise additional capital or other funding as and when needed for our cash
        requirements would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and prospects and on our ability to execute and achieve our business plan.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">If adequate funds are not available for our liquidity needs and cash requirements as and when needed, or at all, we may be required to reduce staff, significantly delay, significantly scale back or even
        discontinue some or all of our research and development programs and clinical and other product development activities, reduce our planned commercialization efforts, enter into potential funding arrangements on unattractive terms, and otherwise
        significantly reduce our cash spend and adjust our operating plan, and we would need to seek to take other steps intended to improve our liquidity, any of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, stock price and our
        relationships with third parties with whom we have business relationships, at least until additional funding is obtained.&#160; We also may be required to evaluate additional licensing opportunities, if any become available, of our proprietary products
        and product candidate programs that we currently plan to self-commercialize or explore other potential liquidity opportunities or other alternatives or options or strategic alternatives, although we cannot be assured that any of these actions would
        be available or available on reasonable terms.&#160; If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders losing most if not all
        of their investment in us.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may sell additional equity, incur debt or raise funds through licensing arrangements to fund our operations, which may result in dilution to our stockholders,
        impose restrictions on our business or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We do not have any committed external source of funds other than potential milestone payments and royalties under certain of our collaboration agreements. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate
        sufficient revenue to fully fund our operations, we would need to seek additional capital and cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other
        collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be
        diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, which could
        also result in dilution of existing stockholders&#8217; ownership. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain increased restrictive covenants (most if not all of which
        currently exist under our existing debt facilities), such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely
        impact our ability to conduct our business and continue to result in liens being placed on all of our assets and intellectual property. If we were to default on such indebtedness, we could lose all such assets and intellectual property and our
        ability to operate our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">If we raise additional funds through collaborations, or strategic alliance, marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may need to relinquish valuable rights to our
        technologies, product candidates or future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Even if we can generate revenues from our operations in the future, our revenues and operating income is likely to fluctuate significantly from year-to-year or

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Even if we are able to generate future revenues, our results of operations would likely continue to vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. Variations may result from, among other

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Although we are in the process of testing and developing proprietary product candidates and may seek to acquire rights in other approved drugs, we anticipate that our ability to generate revenue and to
        become profitable in the near future will depend upon the continued commercial success of our two approved licensed products, Suboxoe and Zuplenz, our first self-commercialized product, Sympazan, and, our product candidate Libervant subject to FDA
        approval of Libervant including our ability to demonstrate to the FDA, and have the FDA conclude, that Libervant is &#8220;clinically superior&#8221; to the currently FDA-approved products for the same active moiety for the same indication as Libervant, which
        we cannot assure, as well as our other licensing and collaboration development activities. There is no assurance that we will become commercially successful to the extent necessary to become profitable. If our current products are not commercially
        successful, our ability to generate manufacturing and sale margins and licensing or royalty revenues will be impaired. Without those revenues, our ability to continue planned development initiatives and commercialization efforts would be limited.
        Due to our dependence on the commercial success of our products, delays or setbacks in the commercial success of any of these products would likely materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results and operations and financial
        consideration.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a single customer and license and any loss or material reduction in revenues from such significant customer
        would adversely affect our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Historically, a substantial portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from a single customer and this trend is expected to continue while we continue to develop, seek regulatory
        approval of and seek to commercialize our proprietary products and product candidates.&#160; If revenues from such key customer were to decline significantly, it would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
        operations.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In April 2019 the U.S. Department of Justice announced that a federal grand jury sitting in the Western District of Virginia had criminally indicated Indivior PLC, or Indivior, for which we exclusively
        manufacture and supply Suboxone film products and license certain of our intellectual property, in connection with Indivior&#8217;s allegedly deceptive and misleading marketing and distribution practices in its distribution and sale of Suboxone film
        products, dating back a number of years, and seeking a monetary judgment of not less than $3 billion.&#160; Indivior has denied the claims and publicly stated that it intends to contest the allegations vigorously.&#160; Indivior accounted for approximately
        86% of our revenues for 2019 and approximately 89% of our revenues for 2018 and in the future will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenues.&#160; However, there can be no assurance that the claims against Indivior could not materially
        and adversely affect Indivior which, if this were to occur, could impact our supply and licensing relationship with Indivior and the volume and timing of its purchases from us and our revenues from Indivior, which could have a material adverse
        financial impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and operating results.&#160; On July 11, 2019, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, the predecessor in interest of Indivior, reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice
        (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to resolve the FTC&#8217;s investigation into the sales and marketing of Suboxone Film by its former pharmaceuticals business, now Indivior, a business that was wholly demerged from Reckitt Benckiser in 2014.&#160;
        Reckitt Benckiser will pay a total of up to $1.4 billion to fully resolve all federal investigations.&#160; As of this filing, Indivior has not publicly disclosed any settlement or other disposition of this matter with the DOJ.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Further, our license agreement with Indivior, under which we manufacture and supply Suboxone to Indivior on an exclusive basis, may be terminated should certain causes or events occur.&#160; For example,
        either party may terminate the relationship in connection with a material breach by the other party of its contractual obligations.&#160; Indivior may also terminate the license agreement if the FDA or other applicable regulatory authority declares our
        manufacturing site to no longer be suitable for the manufacture of Suboxone or Suboxone is no longer suitable to be manufactured due to health or safety reasons.&#160; In addition, our licensing agreement with Indivior currently has a one-year term,
        subject to automatic one-year renewals unless either party provides the other party with twelve months&#8217; prior notice of non-renewal.&#160; As a result, there can be no assurance that either party may not terminate our Indivior license agreement either
        due to any future breach of obligation, other termination cause or event, or notice of non-renewal.&#160; Any such termination would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, capital position and prospects.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Indivior recently announced that it had notified Sandoz, Inc. of Indivior&#8217;s intention to cease production of the Sandoz authorized generic product of Suboxone,
        which can be expected to have a material impact on our manufactured product sales and revenues.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Under a Commercial Exploitation Agreement dated August 2008, or the Indivior License Agreement, we agreed to manufacture and supply Indivior&#8217;s requirements for Suboxone, a sublingual film formulation,
        both inside and outside the U.S., on an exclusive basis.&#160; The initial term of the Indivior License Agreement was seven years from the commencement date and thereafter automatically renews for successive one-year periods, unless either party provide
        the other with written notice of its intent not to renew at least one year prior to the expiration of the then renewal term.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In early 2019, certain third-party pharmaceutical companies launched at risk, generic film products for buprenorphine-naloxone.&#160; Also, in early 2019 Indivior, through Sandoz Inc., began to market and
        sell an authorized generic sublingual film product for Suboxone, which has been well received in the marketplace and which we also exclusively manufactured and supplied.&#160;&#160; On October 15, 2019, Indivior publicly announced that, in order to mitigate
        the impact from the recent passage of H.R. 438 &#8211; Continuing Appropriation Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019, which came into effect on October 1, 2019 and which includes changes to the methodology for calculating average manufacturer
        price for branded drugs&#160; Indivior had given notice to Sandoz of Indivior&#8217;s intention to cease production of the authorized generic sublingual film product.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Indivior has historically accounted for a substantial part of our total annual revenues and, for fiscal 2019, accounted for approximately 86% of our annual revenues.&#160; While we had a strong order book
        for Suboxone products and the authorized generic film for 2019, as a result of Indivior&#8217;s above decision, our manufacturing and supply revenue for the Sandoz authorized generic product has ceased, which will materially negatively affect our
        manufacture and supply revenues and our results of operations.&#160; In addition, although the branded Suboxone has continued to retain significant market share, we have continued to plan for the erosion of this sunsetting branded product over time,
        which will further affect our total revenues and our results from operations.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We are currently involved in antitrust litigation in connection with the launch of Suboxone Sublingual Film and any adverse decisions in such litigation could
        impair our ability to raise addition capital and significantly harm our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are named as a defendant in antitrust litigation brought against us and Indivior. Such litigation involves allegations that we have engaged in conduct intended to interfere with the introduction of
        generic drug products that would compete with our product, Suboxone, in the marketplace. We have denied any wrongdoing and are defending such litigation. However, depending on the outcome of the litigation, including whether or not any judgements
        are entered against us or Indivior and, if so, the extent of those judgements, our ability to earn revenues from Suboxone may be impaired, which may affect our business, profitability, prospects, financial condition ability to generate sufficient
        revenues, and our ability to raise additional funding. Moreover, regardless of the merits of any claim, the continued legal and other costs arising from these judicial proceedings may result in substantial additional expenses and divert our
        management&#8217;s time and attention away from our other business operations, which could also significantly harm our business. For more information, please see Item 3. &#8211; Legal Proceedings &#8211; Antitrust Litigation&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">While we continue to plan to seek to monetize our drug product Apomorphine, there is no assurance that we will be able to monetize our drug product candidate
        Apomorphine in the amount or at the time we have planned, or at all, which, if this were to occur, would have a material adverse impact on our financial position and capital needs.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Although we anticipate monetizing the expected revenue steam from our Apomorphine product candidate, which is out-licensed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, or Sunovion.&#160; Sunovion has not at this point
        obtained regulatory approval of this drug candidate.&#160; We cannot be assured of when, or if, Apomorphine will receive regulatory approval or, if approved, whether we will be successful in monetizing any anticipated revenue stream derived from
        Apomorphine or whether such expected revenue stream will be at a level we have planned or anticipated.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have out-licensed our product candidate Apomorphine to Sunovion, pursuant to which Sunovion has an exclusive worldwide license for Apomorphine.&#160; Sunovion also is responsible for seeking FDA and other
        regulatory approval of Apomorphine.&#160; In November 2019, Sunovion resubmitted its NDA to the FDA.&#160; While the Company has planned for Sunovion obtaining FDA approval for Apomorphine during 2020, we are not responsible for or involved in obtaining such
        regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that the FDA or any non-U.S. regulatory authority will grant approval of Apomorphine or, if approved, will be for all of the indications which we have planned for.&#160; In addition, assuming FDA and
        other regulatory approval of Apomorphine, the anticipated or actual commercialization success and the anticipated market, patient, physician and third-party payer acceptance of Apomorphine, may not be the level we have anticipated or planned for.&#160;
        Any failure to obtain FDA and other regulatory approval of Apomorphine at the time and for indications we have planned for, or at all, or any failure to achieve the commercial success and acceptance of Apomorphine at the financial level we have
        anticipated or planned for, would have a material adverse effect on our funding sources and capital position needed for our operations.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, under the Company&#8217;s Indenture for the Senior Secured Notes, in the event we monetize our anticipated revenue stream from our license of our drug product, Apomorphine, we are required to
        offer the Noteholders the right to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes in the amount of $40 million (if the first re-opener under the Indenture has not been funded) or up to $50 million (if the first re-opener under
        the Senior Secured Notes has been funded), plus 12.5% prepayment premium, accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to the extent elected by the Noteholders.&#160; While the pay down of outstanding principal amounts under the Senior Secured Notes upon any
        such monetization of Apomorphine would improve the Company&#8217;s capital position by reason of having less debt outstanding and netting only the additional cash from the monetization transaction, any such pay down would reduce the amount from such
        monetization available to us for our other funding needs.&#160; In addition, if the gross amount available to us from any such monetization is less than we had anticipated or planned for, and the Senior Note holders elect to have the outstanding
        principal amount under the Senior Secured Notes paid down pursuant to the Indenture, the amount available for our other funding needs would be less than we would have anticipated and planned for, which would have a material adverse impact on our
        business, financial position and funding needs.</div>

      <div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Risks Related to Development and Commercialization of Our Products and Product Candidates</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop our product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Prior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our drug products, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and/or other
        regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other countries, that our particular product candidates are both safe and effective. For each drug product, we must demonstrate its efficacy and monitor its safety throughout the process. If development within
        these parameters is unsuccessful, our business could be harmed, and our stock price could be adversely affected.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We currently have multiple product candidates in preclinical and clinical development. Our business depends primarily on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of
        our product candidates. Before our product candidates can be marketed, the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies must approve our applicable NDA or comparable regulatory submissions. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design
        and implement, can take many years to complete and is very uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Further, positive results from earlier stage clinical trials may not be predictive of
        later clinical trials or other regulatory developments. In addition, many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early stage
        development, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Also, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed
        satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval. Even after successful completion of clinical testing, there is a risk that the FDA may request further information from us, disagree with our
        findings or otherwise undertake a lengthy review of our submission. We also face hurdles and setbacks by reason of competitors&#8217; drug candidates obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals, including orphan drug market exclusivity, prior to our
        obtaining FDA or other regulatory approval of our similar drug candidate. Even if the FDA approves our NDA, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to the numerous factors, including changes in
        clinical trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen, and other clinical trial protocols, and the rate of dropout among clinical participants.&#160; If we fail to
        produce positive results in our planned pre-clinical studies or clinical trials of any of our product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our product candidates and, correspondingly, our
        business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">It is also possible that the FDA will not approve an application that we may submit, or our product candidates may not obtain appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to commence clinical
        trials for our product candidates. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business. This process from development to commercialization can take many years and will likely require the
        expenditure of substantial resources beyond the proceeds we currently have on hand, without any guarantee or assurance that we will be successful with regulatory approval, or commercial success, of such product candidate.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Even if we obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for our current and future product candidates, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use
        restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, or any approval contains
        significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of that product candidate or any other product candidate that we may in-license, develop or acquire in the future.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000;"><font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">We will be required to demonstrate to the FDA that our drug candidate Libervant&#174; provides a &#8220;major contribution to patient care&#8221; relative to the
          approved drugs with the same active moiety for the same indication, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful</font>.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">We are developing Libervant as an alternative to currently approved diazepam products in the form of rectal gel and a recently approved nasal spray.&#160; We completed the rolling submission of our
          NDA filing with the FDA for Libervant on November 27, 2019, our NDA for Libervant was accepted by the FDA on February 10, 2020, and a PDUFA goal date of September 27, 2020 was provided by the FDA.&#160; On January 10, 2020 Neurelis, Inc. obtained FDA
          approval of its drug candidate Valtoco&#174; (diazepam nasal spray).&#160; The FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research granted Valtoco orphan-drug exclusivity on January 10, 2020.&#160; A company that obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug
          receives orphan drug market exclusivity for that drug for the designated indication for a period of seven years from the grant date in the United States.&#160; This orphan drug exclusivity approval limits a subsequently approved product from being
          marketed in the U.S. during the exclusivity period for the same active moiety for the same orphan drug indication, except in a case where the drug candidate sponsor is able to demonstrate, and the FDA concludes, that the later approved drug is
          &#8220;clinically superior&#8221; to the approved product, e.g., safer, more effective, or providing a major contribution to patient care within the meaning of FDA regulations and guidance.&#160; In assessing whether a drug candidate sponsor has demonstrated that
          a drug candidate provides a &#8220;major contribution to patient care&#8221; over and above the currently approved drugs, which is evaluated by the FDA on a case by case basis, there is no one objective standard and the FDA may in appropriate circumstances
          consider such factors as convenience of treatment location, duration of treatment, patient comfort, reduced treatment burden, advances in ease and comfort of drug administration, longer periods between doses, and potential for
          self-administration, and such demonstration to the satisfaction of the FDA is difficult to establish with limited precedents.</div>
      </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div></div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We intend to seek to demonstrate to the FDA that our product candidate Libervant is &#8220;clinically superior&#8221; to the two currently FDA-approved products as qualifying as a &#8220;major contribution to patient
        care&#8221; within the meaning of the FDA regulations and guidance.&#160; However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.&#160; Any failure to obtain FDA approval of or demonstrate &#8220;clinical superiority&#8221; for Libervant would have a
        material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">C<font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">linical trials may be delayed, suspended or terminated for many reasons, which will increase our expenses and delay the time it takes to develop our
          product candidates.</font></div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We may experience delays in our ongoing or future pre-clinical trials, and we do not know whether future pre-clinical studies or clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an
        adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule.&#160; The commencement and completion of clinical trials for our clinical product candidates may be delayed suspended or terminated as a result of many factors, including:</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">If we experience delays in the commencement or completion of any clinical trial of our product candidates, or if any of our clinical trials are suspended or terminated, our costs may substantially
        increase and the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from sales of any of these product candidates will be delayed or not realized at all.&#160; Significant pre-clinical study or
        clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive rights to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully
        commercialize our product candidates.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We have directly marketed just a single product, Sympazan, and that effort is in its very early stages after being only recently launched. With this limited
        experience, we may lack the necessary expertise, personnel and resources to successfully commercialize this product or our other products that must first receive regulatory approval, either on our own or together with collaborators.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have relied on our third-party licensees to commercialize our two lincensed products, Suboxone and Zuplenz, and to date have only marketed, through our own efforts and with the services of
        third-party outsourcing vendors including contract sales personnel, our first self-developed product, Sympazan, first launched in December 2018. Thus, we have a very limited history of direct experience in commercializing product candidates and we
        have no long-term experience upon which to measure our ability or success in commercializing a product or our ability to make predictions about financial results or prospects of any product. To achieve commercial success of our existing product as
        well as our product candidates, if any more are approved, we are in the process of continuing to develop our own sales, marketing and supply capabilities, including through third-party outsourcing and contract sales personnel.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our ongoing commercial strategy for our products and product candidates involves the development of a commercial infrastructure that spans multiple jurisdictions and is dependent upon our ability to
        continue to build an infrastructure that is capable of implementing our commercial product launch strategy. The establishment and development of our commercial infrastructure will continue to be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able
        to develop our commercial infrastructure successfully or in a timely manner or at all. Doing so will require a high degree of coordination and compliance with laws and regulations in numerous territories, including in the United States, each state,
        and other countries in which we do business, including restrictions on advertising practices, enforcement of intellectual property rights, restrictions on pricing or discounts, transparency laws and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory
        requirements and tariffs. If we are unable to effectively coordinate such activities or comply with such laws and regulations, our ability to commercialize our products and product candidates in the United States and other jurisdictions in which it
        is or may be available will be materially adversely affected.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Factors that may affect our ability to commercialize our existing product as well as our product candidates on our own include: recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing
        personnel, including both internally and through contractual third-party outsourcing arrangements, cultivating effective relationships with third-party physicians and overall pharmaceutical industry payors, obtaining access to or persuading
        adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our product candidates and other unforeseen costs associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization. Maintaining a sales and marketing organization requires significant investment
        and resources, is time-consuming and could delay or impair the launch of our product candidates. We may not be able to build an effective sales and marketing organization in the United States or other key global markets. We also intend to enter
        into strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States. We may have difficulty establishing relationships with third parties on terms that are acceptable to us, or in all of the regions
        where we wish to commercialize our products, or at all. If we are unable to build our own distribution and marketing capabilities or to find suitable partners for the commercialization of our products and product candidates, we may have
        difficulties generating revenue from them and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and the trading price of our stock may be materially adversely affected.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If we are unable to successfully establish strong capabilities in sales, marketing, and distribution for our approved products, we may not be successful in
        commercializing our products if and when they obtain regulatory approved.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We currently have resources dedicated toward the sales, marketing, and distribution of our self-developed products and product candidates.&#160; We have limited experience in this area, with Sympazan being
        our first self-developed product which we began commercializing in December 2018.&#160; To commercialize any of our products and product candidates that receive FDA and other regulatory authority marketing approval, we need to continue to build our
        marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities and make arrangements with third parties to perform certain of these services, and we may not be successful in doing so.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We currently have outsourced to a third-party outsourcing firm and contract employees of our sales and marketing functions to sell, market and distribute Sympazan and other our product candidates which
        may receive FDA and other regulatory approval.&#160; If we are unable to enter into satisfactory collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of approved products on acceptable terms or at all, or if any such third parties do not devote
        sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product or otherwise fail in these commercialization efforts, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our approved products or any of our product candidates that receive regulatory
        approval. In entering into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing services and distribution, our product revenues or the profitability of our product revenue could also be lower than if we were to directly market and sell any
        of our products ourselves.&#160; We also have less control over third parties than if we performed the services and functions ourselves.&#160; If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in
        collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Our commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our products and product candidates, if approved, among patients, physicians,

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">It is possible that we may not complete development of our product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for those product candidates. Even if we do complete development and obtain regulatory
        approval for our product candidates, our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among patients, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, the medical community or third-party payors, which is critical to commercial success. Market acceptance of
        our products and any product candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Even if the FDA or other regulatory authorities approve the marketing of any product candidates that we develop, physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community may not accept or use
        them. Efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates generally require significant resources and may not be successful.&#160; If any of our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of
        acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue or any profits from operations.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, the potential market opportunities for our product candidates are difficult to estimate.&#160; Our estimates of the potential market opportunities are predicated on several key assumptions such
        as industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports or analyses and other analytical information.&#160; While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions may be inaccurate.&#160; If any of the assumptions
        proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunity.&#160; If the actual market for our product candidates is smaller than we expect, or if the products fail
        to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, our revenue from product sales may be limited and we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Regulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been
        demonstrated, and any allegations of our failure to comply with such approved indications could limit our sales efforts and have a material adverse effect on our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drugs. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising,
        industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet and off-label promotion. Any regulatory approval that the FDA grants is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which a product
        is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future
        indications for our products and product candidates, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be materially adversely affected.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">While physicians in the U.S. may choose and are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical
        trials and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote our products is narrowly limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. These &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses are common across medical specialties and may
        constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict
        communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA&#8217;s regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In
        addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, bring an enforcement action against us, suspend or withdraw an approved product from the
        market, require a recall or institute fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could materially harm our reputation and our business significantly.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Adverse side effects or other safety risks associated with our product candidates could delay or preclude approval, cause us to suspend or discontinue clinical
        trials, abandon product candidates, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Undesirable side effects that may be caused by any of our products or product candidates could result in the delay, suspension or termination of clinical trials by us, our collaborators, the FDA or
        other regulatory authorities for a number of reasons. Results of our clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our clinical trials could be suspended or
        terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient
        recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. If we elect or are required to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial for any product candidates that we develop, the
        commercial prospects of such product candidates will be materially harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed, materially reduced or eliminated. Any of these occurrences could materially
        harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations significantly.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, clinical trials by their nature utilize a sample of the potential patient population.&#160; However, with a limited number of subjects and limited duration of exposure, certain unusual or
        unexpected side effects of our product candidates may only be uncovered when a significant larger number of patients are exposed to the product.&#160; If safety problems occur or are identified after one our products reached the market, the FDA or
        comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that we amend the labeling of our products, recall our product, or even withdraw approval for our product.&#160; Significant adverse events deemed to be caused by our products or product candidates,
        either before or after receipt of marketing approval, could have a material adverse effect on the development of our drug candidates and our business as a whole.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We could incur substantial costs and disruption to our business and delays in the launch of our product candidates if our competitors and/or collaborators bring
        legal actions against us, which could harm our business and operating results.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We cannot predict whether our competitors or potential competitors, some of whom we collaborate with, may bring legal actions against us based on our research, development and commercialization
        activities, as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities, claiming, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights, breach of contract, false or disparaging statements about another company&#8217;s
        products or product candidates, or other legal theories. To date we have been subject to a number of claims of this nature.&#160; In defending such lawsuits, whether or not they are with or without merit or are ultimately determined in our favor, we
        would continue to face costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. These lawsuits could hinder our ability to enter the market early with our product candidates and thereby hinder our ability to influence usage patterns
        when fewer, if any, of our potential competitors have entered such market, which could adversely impact our potential revenue from such product candidates. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and could be able to
        sustain the cost of litigation to a greater extent and for longer periods of time than we can. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us: to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees, if we are found to
        have willfully infringed a party&#8217;s patent or other intellectual property rights; to cease making, licensing or using products that are alleged to incorporate or make use of the intellectual property of others; to expend additional development
        resources to reformulate our products or prevent us from marketing a certain drug; and to enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the rights to use necessary technologies.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines applicable to certain drug classes which may include our products and product candidates that we are developing. Regulations and guidelines of
        government agencies may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of concomitant therapies. Regulations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of certain drug classes which may include our products and product
        candidates that we are developing or the use of competitive or alternative products as the standard of care to be followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use of our products or product candidates or negatively impact
        our ability to gain market acceptance and market share. For example, Suboxone, which treats opioid addiction, has as one of its active ingredients an opioid, buprenorphine. Revisions to regulations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of opioid
        drugs such as buprenorphine could result in decreased use of Suboxone.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We expect to have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including
        major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and
        development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these
        companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through
        collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these companies. Our
        competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug products or drug administration technologies that are more effective than our approved products or product candidates that we are currently developing or that
        we may develop. In addition, our competitors may file citizen petitions with the FDA in an attempt to persuade the FDA that our product candidates, or the clinical studies that support their approval, contain deficiencies. Such actions by our
        competitors could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2) or other filing pathways.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for our product candidates from third-party payors may be a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific,
        clinical and cost-effectiveness data, including results from expensive pharmacoeconomic studies, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, to each third-party payor. There is no guarantee that we will be able to provide data sufficient
        to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Cost containment is a primary concern of the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere as well as for governmental authorities. Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by
        limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Third-party payors may deny reimbursement for covered products if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with third-party payor
        coverage policies, such as required procedures for cost-effective diagnosis methods and other conditions that must be met before the third-party payor will provide coverage for use of a product. For example, insurers may establish a &#8220;step-edit&#8221;
        system that requires a patient to first use a lower price alternative product prior to becoming eligible for reimbursement of a higher price product. Third-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for drugs, procedures and devices deemed to be
        experimental, or that are prescribed for an unapproved indication. It is also possible that a third-party payor may consider our products or product candidates as substitutable by less expensive therapies and only offer to reimburse patients for
        the less expensive product.&#160; Even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with our products product candidates, pricing of existing drugs may limit the amount we will be able to charge for our products or product
        candidates.&#160; These payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a given product or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return our investment in product
        development.&#160; Further, third-party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Further, some third-party payors
        challenge the prices charged for medical products and may impose price controls or require that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly.&#160; No uniform policy for coverage reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States.&#160; Therefore,
        coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor.&#160; As a result, the coverage determination process is generally a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical support for
        the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.&#160; Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change
        frequently, in some cases at short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once
        coverage is approved. Levels of reimbursement may also decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the reimbursement available for and the pricing of our product
        candidates, once approved, which in turn, could negatively impact the demand for our product candidates. If payors are not adequately reimbursed for our product candidates, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of them, which would result in a
        significant shortfall in achieving revenue expectations and negatively impact our business, prospects and financial condition.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things,
        prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing
        approval. Among policymakers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In
        the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be
        adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any future collaborators, may receive for any approved products. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and
        biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (<font style="font-style: italic;">i.e., </font>automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent
        legislation, including the BBA, extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2027, subject to additional Congressional action. Sequestration may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and, if we obtain regulatory
        approvals, may otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for our product candidates or the frequency with which our product candidates may be prescribed or used if approved. Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of
        new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which is required to be fully implemented in 2019.&#160; At this time, it is unclear how the
        introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement and their choice if medications to use.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Further, legislative changes to or regulatory changes under the PPACA remain possible in the U.S. Congress and under the Trump administration. The nature and extent of any legislative or regulatory
        changes to the PPACA, including repeal and replacement initiatives, are uncertain at this time. It is possible that the PPACA repeal and replacement initiatives, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health
        insurance coverage or in individuals having insurance coverage with less generous benefits, including limited coverage for drugs. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, which was signed
        into law by President Trump, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a
        year that is commonly referred to as the &#8220;individual mandate.&#8221; In addition, the BBA, among other things, amended the PPACA to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the &#8220;donut hole.&#8221; The scope of potential
        future legislation to modify or repeal and replace the PPACA provisions is highly uncertain in many respects. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the PPACA and its possible repeal or replacement on our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States, and members of Congress and the administration have stated that
        they will address such costs through new legislative and administrative measures. This focus has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more
        transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration&#8217;s budget
        proposal for fiscal year 2019 and 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the
        price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a &#8220;Blueprint&#8221;, or plan,
        to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the
        list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is
        immediately implementing others under its existing authority. While some proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have indicated that they will continue
        to pursue new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing,
        including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk
        purchasing.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive
        for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may
        prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that
        federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is also subject to governmental control outside the United States. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take
        considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates to
        other available product candidates. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our ability to generate revenues and become profitable could be impaired.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted. The TCJA is major tax legislation that, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reducing the corporate tax rate from
        a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%; limiting the tax deduction for interest expense; limiting the deduction for net operating losses and eliminating net operating loss carrybacks, in each case, for losses arising in taxable years
        beginning after December 31, 2017 (though any such tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely); eliminating certain requirements of the PPACA, including the individual mandate; and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits,
        including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions generally referred to as &#8220;orphan drugs&#8221;. The effect of the TCJA on us and our affiliates,
        whether adverse or favorable, is uncertain and may not become evident for some period of time. You are urged to consult your tax adviser regarding the implications of the TCJA on an investment in our common stock.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Even though we have obtained orphan drug designation for certain product candidates in the United States, we may not obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for
        these or other product candidates, and we may not obtain orphan drug designation or exclusivity for any of our other product candidates or indications.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate
        a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of
        market exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same disease for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was
        materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for
        marketing approval.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">A company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the designated rare disease or condition receives orphan drug market exclusivity for that drug for the designated disease for a
        period of seven years in the United States. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application to market a drug containing the same active moiety for the same orphan indication, except in very limited circumstances,
        including when the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care within the meaning of FDA regulations and guidance. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug
        exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Even if we receive orphan drug designation for one or more of our drug candidates, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties
        associated with developing product candidates. If any of these other pharmaceutical companies obtains approval of an NDA before we are able to receive approval for one or more of our drug candidates with the same active moiety for the same
        indication, we would be barred from marketing that product in the United States during the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, unless we could demonstrate that such drug candidate is clinically superior to the approved products or satisfies
        one of the other limited exceptions to such orphan drug exclusivity.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be
        approved for the same condition or a drug with the same active moiety can be approved for a different indication. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in
        the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, even if we intend to seek orphan drug designation for any of our product candidates or indications, we may never receive such designations or obtain orphan drug exclusivity.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or
        meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, to monitor and manage data for our preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties
        for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol,
        legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with FDA laws and regulations regarding current good clinical practice, or GCP,
        which are also required by the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in the form of International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines for all of our
        products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated
        in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by
        a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under the current good manufacturing
        practice, or cGMP, regulations. While we have agreements governing activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over their actual performance. In addition, portions of the clinical trials for our product candidates are expected to be conducted
        outside of the United States, which will make it more difficult for us to monitor CROs and visit our clinical trial sites and will force us to rely heavily on CROs to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and compliance with
        applicable regulations, including GCP. Failure to comply with applicable regulations in the conduct of the clinical trials for our product candidates may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.</div>

        alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time
        and resources to our preclinical and clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they
        obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or
        successfully commercialize our product candidates. Consequently, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to generate revenue could be
        delayed significantly.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays
        occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we strive to manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future
        or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We rely on limited sources of supply for our thin film foil, and any disruption in the chain of supply may impact production and sales and cause delay in
        developing and commercializing our proprietary PharmFilm&#174; Technology product candidates.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We currently have relationships with two third-parties for the manufacture of our thin film foil. Because of the unique equipment and process for manufacturing our thin film foil, transferring
        manufacturing activities for our foil to an alternate supplier would be a time-consuming and costly endeavor, and there are only a limited number of manufacturers that we believe are capable of performing this function for us. Switching thin film
        foil suppliers may involve substantial cost and could result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines. If any of our thin film foil manufacturers breaches or terminates their agreements with us, we would need to identify an
        alternative source for the thin film foil manufacture and supply of foil to us for the purposes of our development and commercialization of the applicable products. Identifying an appropriately qualified source of alternative thin film foil supply
        for any one or more of these product candidates could be time consuming, and we may not be able to do so without incurring material delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, or in satisfying our manufacturing and
        supply commitments and obligations for our licensed products and our commercialized self-developed products, which could harm our financial position, the commercial potential for our products, and our results of operations, as well as to result in
        a default in our supply commitments and obligations. Any alternative thin film foil vendor would also need to be qualified through an NDA supplement which could result in further delay. The FDA or other regulatory agencies outside of the United
        States may also require additional studies if we appoint a new manufacturer for supply of our product candidates that differs from the manufacturer used for clinical development of such product candidates. For our other product candidates, we
        expect that only one supplier will initially be qualified as a vendor with the FDA. If supply from the approved vendor is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">These factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our approved products and product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs
        and prevent us from commercializing them successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of components and active pharmaceutical ingredient on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and
        we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, we would likely be in default in our supply obligations, which could result in the termination of our supply obligations, our
        incurring potential default damages and our loss of significant revenues.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 20pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We rely on third parties to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, for our product candidates, and we intend to rely on third parties to
        manufacture the API for any other approved products. The commercialization of any of our products could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of API or fail to do so at
        acceptable quality levels or prices or fail to maintain or achieve satisfactory regulatory compliance.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture API for our licensed products, our existing proprietary product and our product candidates, and control only certain
        aspects of their activities.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it could delay our proprietary product candidate programs and
        commercialization activities. Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory and scientific standards and any
        applicable trial protocols or our obligations under our product supply commitments and obligations. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our studies in accordance with
        regulatory requirements or our stated study plans and protocols, we will not be able to complete, or may be delayed in completing, clinical trials required to support future regulatory submissions and approval of our product candidates and we would
        likely be in default in our supply commitments and obligations, which could result in the termination of our supply obligations, our incurring potential default damages and our loss of significant revenues.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our products and product candidates are highly reliant on very complex sterile techniques and personnel aseptic techniques. The facilities used by us, and by our third-party API manufacturers, to
        manufacture our products and product candidates must maintain a compliance status acceptable to the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA to the FDA. If we or any of
        our third-party API manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the applicable regulatory authorities&#8217; strict regulatory requirements, or pass regulatory inspection, we or they will not be able to
        secure or maintain regulatory approval for the manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of third-party API manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Further, as
        we scale up manufacturing of our product candidates and conduct required stability testing, product, packaging, equipment and process-related issues may require refinement or resolution in order for us to proceed with our planned clinical trials
        and obtain regulatory approval for commercialization of our product candidates. In the future, for example, we may identify impurities in the product manufactured by us or for us for commercial supply, which could result in increased scrutiny by
        the regulatory agencies, delays in our clinical program and regulatory approval, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products and product candidates. If the FDA or any other applicable regulatory
        authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, or if our suppliers or third-party manufacturers decide they no longer want to manufacture our products, we would
        need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products or product candidates and which could also result in default in our supply commitments
        and obligations, our incurring potential default damages and our loss of significant revenues.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">More generally, we and our API manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, may often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production. These problems
        include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign
        regulations. Additionally, we and our API manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If we or our manufacturers were to encounter any of
        these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to manufacture our products, or to make our product candidates available for clinical trials and development purposes or to further commercialize any of
        our products and product candidates in the United States, would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in our ability to meet commercial demand may result in the loss of significant potential revenues and could adversely affect our ability to
        gain market acceptance for approved products as well as a potential default of our supply commitments or obligations. In addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials,
        increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely. Additionally, if supply from
        one approved API manufacturer is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. Regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching
        manufacturers may involve substantial costs and would likely result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines and disrupt our supply commitment and obligations.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">All entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial
        sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP and equivalent foreign standards. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and
        operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to
        inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. The development, manufacture, supply, and distribution of our products and our product candidates is highly regulated
        and technically complex. We, along with our third-party providers, must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA and foreign authorities.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We, or our API and component manufacturers, must supply all necessary documentation in support of our regulatory filings for our product candidates on a timely basis and must adhere to the FDA&#8217;s good
        laboratory practices, or GLP, and cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program, and the equivalent standards of the regulatory authorities in other countries. Any failure by us or by our third-party API or
        component manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale-up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory
        approval of any of our product candidates. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party API and component manufacturers must also pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the
        applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates or any of our other potential products. In addition, the regulatory authorities in any country may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility
        involved with the preparation of our product candidates or our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities and quality systems do
        not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, FDA approval of our product candidates, or the equivalent approvals in other jurisdictions, will not be granted.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, inspect our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party suppliers or contractors. If any such inspection
        identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial
        measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third-party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales of our approved products or the temporary or permanent closure
        of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business. If we or any of our third-party API or component manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can
        impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending NDA for a new drug product or revocation of a pre-existing approval. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially
        harmed result in a significant loss of revenues and results and result in a potential default in our supply commitments or obligations, which could lead to termination of our supply obligations our incurrence of default damages and our loss of
        significant revenues.</div>

          adversely affect, and potentially prohibit, our ability to develop our product candidates.</font></div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Because developing pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products are expensive, we continue
        to explore collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties that have available resources and experience both in the United States and in territories outside of the United States. We continue to explore selective collaborations with
        third parties for development and commercialization of our product candidates both in and outside of the United States. We may, however, be unable to advance the development and/or commercialization of our products and product candidates in
        territories outside of the United States, which may limit the market potential for certain product candidates outside the U.S.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In situations where we enter into a development and commercial collaborative arrangement for a product or product candidate, we may also seek to establish additional collaborations for development and
        commercialization in territories outside of those addressed by the first collaborative arrangement for such product candidate. There are a limited number of potential partners, and we expect to face competition in seeking appropriate partners. If
        we are unable to enter into any development and commercial collaborations and/or sales and marketing arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, we may be unable to successfully develop and seek regulatory approval for our product or product
        candidates and/or effectively market and sell approved products, if any, in all of the territories outside of the United States where it may otherwise be valuable to do so.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Whether we reach an agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator&#8217;s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed
        collaboration and the proposed collaborator&#8217;s evaluation of a number of factors.&#160; Those factors may include the likelihood of approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, the potential market for the product candidate, the costs and
        complexities of delivering such product candidate to patients, competing products, and industry and market conditions generally.&#160; Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all.&#160; If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our
        own, we may need to obtain significant additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.&#160; If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and
        generate product revenue.</div>

        marketing, customer service support, warehousing and inventory program services, distribution services, contract administration and chargeback processing services, accounts receivable management and cash application services, and financial
        management and information technology services. If these third parties fail to perform as expected or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize Sympazan and other products we commercialize will be significantly
        impacted and we may be subject to regulatory sanctions.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the sale and distribution of our self-developed products, including Sympazan, key aspects
        of which are out of our direct control. These service providers provide key services related to sales, marketing, customer service support, warehousing and inventory program services, distribution services, contract administration and chargeback
        processing services, accounts receivable management and cash application services, financial management and information technology services. In addition, our inventory is stored at a warehouse maintained by this service provider. We substantially
        rely on the provider as well as other third-party providers that perform services for us. If these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines or otherwise do not carry out
        their contractual duties to us, or encounter damage or disruption at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired. In addition, we may engage third parties to perform various other
        services for us relating to adverse event reporting, safety database management, fulfillment of requests for medical information regarding our product candidates and related services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these
        service providers is insufficient, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may not be successful in maintaining development and commercialization collaborations, and any collaboration partner may not devote sufficient resources to the
        development or commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in development or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and successfully commercialize certain of our products and product
        candidates and our financial condition and operating results.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">When we establish collaborative arrangements, such collaboration may not ultimately be successful, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
        prospects. If we collaborate with a third-party for development and commercialization of a product or product candidate, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the third-party. It
        is possible that a third-party collaborator may not devote sufficient resources to the development or commercialization of our product or product candidate or may otherwise fail in development or commercialization efforts, in which event the
        development and commercialization of such product or product candidate could be delayed or terminated and our business could be substantially harmed. In addition, the terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may not prove
        to be favorable to us or may not be perceived as favorable, which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing development of a product or product candidate or research program
        under a collaboration, and the payment we receive from our partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development. Moreover, collaborations and sales and marketing arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and
        implement, and they may require substantial resources to maintain.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are subject to a number of additional risks associated with our dependence on collaborations with third parties, the occurrence of which could cause our collaborative arrangements to fail, including

        may be averse to our interests. Any such disagreement between us and a third-party collaborator could result in one or more of the following, each of which could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product or product

        on Form 10-K, and other key executives, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Any of our executive officers could leave our employment at any time. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees for
        our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms
        given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We will need to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our Company has been rapidly growing based upon our number of products and product candidates in our pipeline, and we expect to continue to grow over the next number of years. As our Company matures, we
        expect to expand our employee base to increase our managerial, scientific and engineering, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources and to hire more consultants and contractors. Future growth would impose significant additional
        responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants, contractors and contract employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount
        of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our
        infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Future growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources
        from other projects, such as the development of our existing or future product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could
        be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our products and product candidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability
        to effectively manage any future growth.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, our expected continuing growth in our management team adds increased expense which we must absorb, without necessarily growth in our revenues. This increase in expense may negatively impact
        our results of operations and may add to our need for additional funds.</div>
      <div><br>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Our products and, if approved, product candidates, may give rise to potential product liability claims or false marketing claims, and, if successful claims are
        brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">As a pharmaceutical company, we operate in a market that is subject to significant risk of liability. The sales of our approved products and of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing
        approval and the use of our product candidates in clinical trials, if any, exposes us to the risk of product liability claims alleging adverse effects from such products or product candidates and false marketing claims relating to the

        successfully defend against product liability claims or false marketing claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims or false marketing claims may result in:</div>

        generally necessary for us to secure certain levels of insurance as a condition for the conduct of clinical trials and any sale or use of our products. We have procured product liability insurance with respect to the sale of our approved products
        and all clinical trials performed to date for which we were responsible (<font style="font-style: italic;">i.e., </font>in respect of our internal product pipeline). Further, we may seek to expand our insurance coverage for our approved products

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future,
        we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at an acceptable cost to us or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had
        unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could materially adversely affect our results of
        operations and business.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity
        incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses,
        unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We have previously been the target of a phishing attack that resulted in unauthorized access to email.&#160; While our systems have been secured and
        strengthened, there can be no assurance that we will not experience cyber-attacks in the future, suffer indirect consequences from cyber-attack on a third-party, or fail to anticipate, identify or offset such threats of potential cyber-attacks or
        security breaches in a timely manner.&#160; This is especially so considering the nature of cyber-attack techniques, which change frequently, can be difficult to detect for extended periods of time and often are not recognized until they succeed.&#160;
        System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our product development and clinical activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring
        substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of product development or clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent
        that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our development programs and the
        development of our product candidates could be delayed.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are subject to U.S. data protection laws and regulations, including laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. Numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach
        notification laws and state health information privacy laws, govern the collection, use, and disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in
        government enforcement actions and create liability for us, which could include civil and/or criminal penalties, private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business. EU member states and other
        countries have also adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. In the European Union, the collection and use of personal health data has been governed by the provisions of the EU Data Protection
        Directive. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the Data Protection Directive (with an enforcement date of May 25, 2018) and is designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe and to protect all EU citizens&#8217; data privacy
        and will have a significant impact on how certain data is processed and handled. The European Union data protection laws and regulations impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data,
        including health data clinical trials.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or implemented could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and

        any reason, including by fire, natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado or severe storm, power outage, systems failure, labor dispute or other unforeseen disruption, then we may be prevented from effectively operating our business. Our
        coverage for natural disasters may be somewhat limited for floods or earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance for any unexpected events to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur
        could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.</div>

            have now been confirmed in other countries, including the United States. Our operations could be adversely affected to the extent that the coronavirus or other epidemics were to substantially impact the United States. Depending on the scope and
            severity of the coronavirus, our operations could potentially experience disruptions, such as temporary closure of our offices or manufacturing facilities, delays or suspensions in our clinical trials and/or suspension of services, which may
            materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently source our raw materials from China and we intentionally keep safety stock of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), drug
            product, critical raw materials and components.&#160; However, shelf life of these items affects reorder points and we may not be able to sustain long periods of disruption. Depending on the scope and severity of the outbreak, our suppliers of API
            and intermediate raw materials and components used in our drug products, could experience disruption in their businesses resulting in a material and adverse impact on our supply chain continuity. Further, if our licensees&#8217; businesses are
            similarity affected, they might delay or reduce purchases of drug products from us, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the coronavirus may impact us will

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and
        other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could
        involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always
        possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other
        actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the
        imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements
        and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any
        of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Certain laws and regulations require us to test our product candidates on animals before initiating clinical trials involving humans. Animal testing activities have been the subject of controversy and
        adverse publicity. Animal rights groups and other organizations and individuals have attempted to stop animal testing activities by pressing for legislation and regulation in these areas and by disrupting these activities through protests and other
        means. To the extent the activities of these groups are successful, our research and development activities may be interrupted, delayed or become more expensive.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Our operations involve hazardous materials and we and third parties with whom we contract must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be
        expensive and restrict how we do business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">As a pharmaceutical company, we are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with health and safety
        regulations is substantial. Our business activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. Our research and development activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our
        product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and manufacturers and suppliers with whom we may contract are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some
        cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers&#8217; facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these
        materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations
        governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. We cannot guarantee that that the safety procedures utilized by third-party manufacturers and suppliers with whom we may contract will comply with
        the standards prescribed by laws and regulations or will eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources
        and U.S. federal and state or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become
        more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do maintain environmental liability insurance coverage to mitigate our exposure in the event of an accident or environmental discharge.
        In the event that we may be held liable for any consequential damage and any resulting claims for damages, which may exceed our insured limits and financial resources, we may incur costs that may materially adversely affect our business, results of
        operations and prospects, and the value of our shares.</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Changes in law, including as a result of presidential administration changes, could have a negative impact on the approval of our product candidates.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For
        example, certain policies of the Trump administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant
        burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA&#8217;s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuing of guidance, and reviewing and approving of marketing applications.
        While some of the prior Executive Orders have since been rescinded, if new executive actions impose constraints on the FDA&#8217;s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Risks related to the ongoing efforts of the Trump administration with respect to the repeal or repeal and replacement of elements of the PPACA are described above under the heading &#8220;Recently enacted and
        future healthcare reform legislation or regulation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and may adversely affect the prices we, or they,
        may obtain and may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.&#8221; We cannot predict whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the pharmaceutical industry generally.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If the FDA does not conclude that our product candidates satisfy the requirements for the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for
        approval of any of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for our product candidates will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and encounter significantly greater complications
        and risks than anticipated, and in any case may not be successful.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We intend to seek FDA approval through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for each of our product candidates described in this report. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984,
        also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that
        were not conducted by or for the applicant.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our product candidates as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and
        information and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates would likely substantially increase. Moreover, the inability to
        pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market faster than our product candidates, which could materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are permitted to
        pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for a product candidate, we cannot assure you that we will receive the requisite or timely approvals for commercialization of such product candidate.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain competitors and others have objected to the FDA&#8217;s interpretation of
        Section 505(b)(2). We expect that our competitors could file citizens&#8217; petitions with the FDA in an attempt to persuade the FDA that our product candidates, or the clinical studies that support their approval, contain deficiencies. If the FDA&#8217;s
        interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may be required to change its Section 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2).</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Clinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial
        results. Failure can occur at any stage of clinical development.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Clinical testing, even when utilizing the 505(b)(2) pathway, is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical
        trial process, even with active ingredients that have previously been approved by the FDA as safe and effective. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later
        stage clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our product candidates are in various stages of development, from early stage to late stage. Clinical trial failures may occur at any stage and may result from a multitude of factors both within and
        outside our control, including flaws in formulation, adverse safety or efficacy profile and flaws in trial design, among others. If the trials result in negative or inconclusive results, we or our collaborators may decide, or regulators may require
        us, to discontinue trials of the product candidates or conduct additional clinical trials or preclinical studies. In addition, data obtained from trials and studies are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our
        data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. For these reasons, our future clinical trials may not be successful.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We do not know whether any future clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates. If any
        product candidate for which we are conducting clinical trials is found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for it. If we are unable to bring any of our current or future product candidates to market, our
        business would be materially harmed and our ability to create long-term stockholder value will be limited.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Delays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and could jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain
        regulatory approval and commence product sales. We may also find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent development of our product candidates.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed
        on schedule, if at all. Our clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:</div>

        and may vary among jurisdictions.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">This lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, which would harm
        our business, results of operations and prospects significantly.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we
        intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the
        successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing scenarios could harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have limited experience using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to submit an NDA or any similar drug approval filing to the FDA, and we cannot be certain that any of our existing or future product
        candidates will receive regulatory approval. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our
        product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, to a significant extent, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval. If the markets for patients or indications that we are targeting are not as
        significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, if approved.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">If we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses of our products or product candidates, if approved, we may become subject to significant liability. Such enforcement has become more common in
        the industry. The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, such as our product candidates, if approved. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are
        not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product&#8217;s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for our product candidates for our proposed indications, physicians may nevertheless use our products for
        their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label, if the physicians believe in their professional medical judgment it could be used in such manner. However, if we are found to have promoted our products for any off-label
        uses, the federal government could levy civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, and seek fines against us. The FDA or other regulatory authorities could also request that we enter into a consent decree or a corporate integrity agreement or
        seek a permanent injunction against us under which specified promotional conduct is monitored, changed or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of our product candidates, if approved, we could become subject to significant
        liability, which would materially adversely affect our business, business prospects and financial condition.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Our business is subject to extensive regulatory requirements and our approved products and product candidates that obtain regulatory approval will be subject to
        ongoing and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize such products.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Even after a product is approved, we will remain subject to ongoing FDA and other regulatory requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising,
        promotion, import, export, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events, or AEs, and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in
        the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must
        comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. In addition, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed
        or on the conditions of approval. For example, a product&#8217;s approval may contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product, or the imposition of a REMS program.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The holder of an NDA is subject to payment of user fees and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. A manufacturer is also subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other
        regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMPs. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is
        manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring product recall, notice to physicians, withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Similar post-market requirements may apply in foreign jurisdictions in which we may seek approval of our products. Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend
        significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to market our products or commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, the FDA&#8217;s regulations, policies or guidance may change and new or additional statutes or government regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions may be enacted that could
        prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from pending or future
        legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products and/or product candidates, which would materially
        adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We are required to obtain regulatory approval for each of our products in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market such products, and the inability to obtain
        such approvals would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In order to market products outside of the United States, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in
        one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. However, the failure to obtain regulatory approval in
        one jurisdiction may adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval in another jurisdiction. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods.
        Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to
        country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approval in
        international markets is delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If we fail to develop, acquire or in-license other product candidates or products, our business and prospects will be limited.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our long-term growth strategy is to develop and commercialize a portfolio of product candidates in addition to our existing products and product candidates. We may also acquire or in-license early to
        mid-stage new chemical entities, or NCEs. Although we have internal research and development capacity that we believe will enable us to make improvements to existing compounds, we do not have internal drug discovery capabilities to identify and
        develop entirely new chemical entities or compounds. As a result, our primary means of expanding our pipeline of product candidates is to develop improved formulations and administration methods for existing FDA-approved products and/or select and
        acquire or in-license product candidates for the treatment of therapeutic indications that complement or augment our current targets, or that otherwise fit into our development or strategic plans on terms that are acceptable to us. Developing new
        formulations of existing products or identifying, selecting and acquiring or in-licensing promising product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources expertise. Efforts to do so may not result in the actual
        development, acquisition or in-license of a particular product candidate, potentially resulting in a diversion of our management&#8217;s time and the expenditure of significant resources with no resulting benefit. If we are unable to add additional
        product candidates to our pipeline, our long-term business and prospects will be limited.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Public concern regarding the safety of any of our drug products could result in the inclusion of unfavorable information in our labeling or require us to undertake
        other activities that may entail additional costs.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Considering widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, the FDA, members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public
        have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and the establishment of risk management programs that
        may, for example, restrict distribution of drug products after approval. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, grants significant expanded authority to the FDA, much of which is aimed at improving the safety of drug
        products before and after approval. In particular, the FDAAA authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and clinical trials, mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information and require risk
        evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs, including certain currently approved drugs. The FDAAA also significantly expands the federal government&#8217;s clinical trial registry and results databank, which we expect will result in
        significantly increased government oversight of clinical trials. Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties, among other regulatory, civil and criminal
        penalties. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA in its review of data from our clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny, particularly with respect to safety,
        which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. If the FDA requires us to provide additional clinical or preclinical data for any of our approved drug products, the
        indications for which that product candidate was approved may be limited or there may be specific warnings or limitations on dosing, and our efforts to commercialize any approved product may be otherwise adversely impacted.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights of any of our product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our products and our product candidates. The issuance,
        scope, validity, enforceability, strength and commercial value of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail
        to result in issued patents with claims that cover the products, if approved, or product candidates in the United States or in foreign countries or territories. If this were to occur, early generic competition could be expected against our
        products, if approved, and our product candidates in development. There may be relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications which could invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing based on a pending patent
        application. In particular, because the active pharmaceutical ingredients in many of our product candidates have been on the market as separate products for many years, it is possible that these products have previously been used off-label in such
        a manner that such prior usage would affect the validity of our patents or our ability to obtain patents based on our patent applications.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming. We or our licensors may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications for a commercially
        reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we or our licensors may fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too
        late to obtain patent protection on them. Moreover, depending on the terms of any future in-licenses to which we may become a party, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain
        the patents, covering technology in-licensed from third parties. Therefore, these patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents
        are difficult to enforce or which we choose not to seek to patent, and any other elements of our drug development and reformulation processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we
        generally require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and we generally seek to have all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter
        into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise
        gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises
        and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any
        breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors or other third parties. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient
        recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA is considering whether to make additional information publicly
        available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA&#8217;s disclosure policies may change in the future, if at all. If we are
        unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish
        or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may enjoy only limited geographical protection with respect to certain patents and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the
        world.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending patents covering our products, if approved, or product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive.
        Competitors may use our and our licensors&#8217; technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we and our licensors
        have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States or Europe. These products may compete with our products or product candidates, and our and our licensors&#8217; patents or other intellectual property rights
        may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant. The examination of each national or regional patent application is an independent proceeding. As a result,
        patent applications in the same family may issue as patents in some jurisdictions, such as in the United States, but may issue as patents with claims of different scope or may even be refused in other jurisdictions. It is also quite common that
        depending on the country, the scope of patent protection may vary for the same product candidate or technology.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws or rules and regulations in the United States and Europe, and many companies have encountered
        significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual
        property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in other jurisdictions,
        whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of
        not issuing as patents, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our
        efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual
        property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our
        intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets. If we or our licensors
        encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished, and we may face additional
        competition from others in those jurisdictions.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Some countries also have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against
        government agencies or government contractors. In those countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patents. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties
        with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our
        issued patents.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our ability to obtain patents is highly uncertain because, to date, some legal principles remain unresolved, there has not been a consistent policy regarding the breadth or interpretation of claims
        allowed in patents in the United States and the specific content of patents and patent applications that are necessary to support and interpret patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific and
        factual issues. Changes in either patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, on September 16,
        2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will
        be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, has developed new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the
        substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in March 2013. The Leahy-Smith Act has also introduced procedures making it easier for third parties to
        challenge issued patents, as well as to intervene in the prosecution of patent applications. Finally, the Leahy-Smith Act contains new statutory provisions that still require the USPTO to issue new regulations for their implementation and it may
        take the courts years to interpret the provisions of the new statute.</div>
      <div>&#160;</div>

        <div style="width: 100%;" id="DSPFPageHeader"><a href="#TableofContents"><font style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;">Table of Contents</font></a></div>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in
        certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by
        the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents or patents that we might obtain
        in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations
        may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents or patents that we may obtain in the future. Accordingly, it is too early to tell what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business and
        the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our
        issued patents. An inability to obtain, enforce and defend patents covering our proprietary technologies would materially and adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant
        problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. For example, if the issuance to us, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of
        patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the written description or enablement, in a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation
        given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other
        countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We are currently, and in the future will likely continue to be, involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which are
        expensive, require us to expend substantial financial resources, are time consuming, may continue for many years for one or more claims and may be unsuccessful.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of any licensors and potential licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we have been, and in the future may be, required to file
        infringement claims, which are expensive and time-consuming. For example, beginning in August 2013, we filed patent infringement lawsuits against six generic companies in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for the approval by the
        FDA of generic versions of Suboxone Sublingual Film in the United States. Of these, cases against three of the six generic companies have been resolved. We are also seeking to enforce our patent rights in multiple cases as further described in Item
        3.&#160; Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the
        grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent
        applications at risk of not issuing.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Interference proceedings invoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our
        collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be significantly harmed if the prevailing party does not
        offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our bringing or defending litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees from our core
        business. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">As described in Item 3.&#160; Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a number of our issued patents are involved in litigations. In addition to the challenges we face in those litigations, a
        number of our issued patents are or have been involved in administrative proceedings, such as reexamination and <font style="font-style: italic;">inter partes</font> review at the USPTO and opposition at the EPO. There can be no assurance that all
        claims of the challenged patents will be upheld or that the patents challenged by us will be found infringed. We may lose any of the challenged patents entirely, or we may have to amend the scope of claims to an extent which may be considered
        insufficient to cover our products or product candidates. If any of those scenarios were to occur, we might lose our competitive advantage in our market, and our business could be materially affected.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised
        by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it
        could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. For more information, please see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Third parties may commence legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could
        have a negative impact on the success of our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability, and the ability of our existing and future collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, if approved, and use
        our proprietary technologies without alleged or actual infringement, misappropriation or other violation of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.&#160; There have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other
        intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.&#160; Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product
        candidates.&#160; In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We may have been and in the future may become party to or be threatened with adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and
        technology, which may include interference or derivation proceedings, post grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO or similar adversarial proceedings or litigation in any jurisdiction.&#160; Similarly, we or our licensors or collaborators
        have initiated, and in the future may initiate, such proceedings or litigation against third parties, which may include challenging the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by third parties.&#160; Third parties have asserted and
        in the future may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit.&#160; There is a risk that additional third parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to
        enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us.&#160; Even if we believe any of those claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, and the
        holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product or product candidates unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or
        unenforceable.&#160; Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our technology, holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable
        product or product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by our product or technology.&#160; In either case, such a license may not be available on
        commercially reasonable terms, or at all.&#160; Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us.&#160; Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may
        need or may choose to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates.&#160; We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all.&#160; In such
        event, we may be unable to further practice our technologies or develop and commercialize any of our product candidates at issue, which could significantly harm our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, if
        approved.&#160; Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, could involve substantial litigation expense and a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business.&#160; Third parties making such claims may have the ability to dedicate
        substantially greater resources to these legal actions than we or our licensors or collaborators can.&#160; In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#8217;
        fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 20pt; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;"><font style="font-style: italic;">The patents and patent applications that we have covering our products and product candidates are limited to specific formulations and manufacturing
          processes, and our market opportunity for our products and product candidates may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active ingredients and by competition from other formulations and manufacturing processes, as well as
          administration methods that may be developed by competitors</font>.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have obtained and continue to seek to obtain patent protection for our manufacturing technology, drug administering technology and our products and product candidates, including specific formulations
        and manufacturing processes, which may not be as effective as composition of matter coverage in preventing work-arounds by competitors. As a result, generic products that do not infringe the claims of our issued patents covering formulations and
        processes are, or may be, available while we are marketing our products. Competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval will be able to commercialize products with the same active ingredients as our products or product candidates so long
        as the competitors do not infringe any process, use or formulation patents that we have developed for our products or product candidates, subject to any regulatory exclusivity we may be able to obtain for our products.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The number of patents and patent applications covering products containing the same active ingredient as our products or product candidates indicates that competitors have sought to develop and may seek
        to commercialize competing formulations that may not be covered by our patents and patent applications. The commercial opportunity for our products or product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop and
        commercialize alternative formulations of our products or product candidates that are different from ours and do not infringe our issued patents covering our products or use of our products.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Suboxone, Zuplenz, Sympazan and Exservan have been approved by the FDA, and we anticipate that other product candidates may be approved by the FDA in the future. As additional products of ours are on
        the market, one or more third parties may also challenge the patents that we control covering our products, which could result in the invalidation or unenforceability of some or all of the relevant patent claims of our issued patents covering our
        products.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">If we or one of our licensing partners initiated legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim, and
        have in certain existing proceedings counterclaimed, that the patent covering our product or product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or
        unenforceability are common, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third-party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad,
        even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (<font style="font-style: italic;">e.g., </font>opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could
        result in revocation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question,
        for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or
        unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. For more information, please see Item 3.
        Legal Proceedings.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by
        government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside
        of the United States over the lifetime of our owned and licensed patents and/or applications and any patent rights we may own or license in the future. We rely on our outside counsel or our licensing partners to monitor the status of these fees so
        that we may make required payments of these fees when due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government patent agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions
        during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply and we are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed
        intellectual property. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of
        the patents or patent applications, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance could harm our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Our drug development strategy relies heavily upon the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which requires us to certify that we do not infringe upon third-party patents
        covering approved drugs. Such certifications typically result in third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, the defense of which will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in any litigation may prevent or delay our
        development and commercialization efforts which would harm our business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights are often complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management&#8217;s attention from other
        aspects of our business and may result in unfavorable outcomes that could adversely impact our ability to launch and market our product candidates, or to prevent third parties from competing with our products and product candidates.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries,
        including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter party reexamination proceedings before the USPTO. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties,
        exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims
        of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our commercial success depends in large part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties for existing approved drug products. Because we utilize the 505(b)(2)
        regulatory pathway for the approval of our products and product candidates, we rely in whole or in part on studies conducted by third parties related to those approved drug products. As a result, upon filing with the FDA for approval of our product
        candidates, we will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1) there is no patent information listed in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book with respect to our NDA; (2) the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (3) the listed patents have not
        expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our proposed drug product. When we submit a paragraph IV
        certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to the patent owner once our 505(b)(2) NDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. The third-party may then initiate a lawsuit against us to defend the patents
        identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving our NDA until the earliest of 30 months or the date on which the patent expires, the lawsuit
        is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in our favor. If the third-party does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, our NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition to paragraph IV litigation noted above, third-party owners of patents may generally assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party
        patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations or methods of manufacture related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending or
        subsequently filed patent applications which may later result in issued patents that may be infringed by our products or product candidates. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our product
        candidates, including the formulation, any method or process involved in the manufacture of any of our product candidates, any molecules or intermediates formed during such manufacturing process or any other attribute of the final product itself,
        the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our product candidates unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. In either case, such a license may not be available on
        commercially reasonable terms or at all.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot assure you that our business, products, product
        candidates and methods do not or will not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Parties making claims against us may request and/or obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product
        candidates on a temporary or permanent basis. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, involves substantial litigation expense and could be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful
        claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products or
        manufacturing processes, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms.
        Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research, manufacture clinical trial supplies or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these
        licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our products or product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot
        provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our products or product candidates, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to
        pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have
        inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees&#8217; former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our
        patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims and even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and
        other employees from our core business.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership
        disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates and companion diagnostic. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims
        challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual
        property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation generally involves substantial costs and can be a distraction to management and other employees.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If we are not able to obtain adequate trademark protection or regulatory approval for our brand names, we may be required to re-brand affected products, which
        could cause delays in getting such product to market, substantively impact successful commercialization of any such product and substantially increase our costs.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">To protect our rights in any trademark we use or intend to use for our products or our product candidates, we may seek to register such trademarks. Trademark registration is territory-specific and we
        must apply for trademark registration in the United States as well as any other country where we intend to commercialize our product or product candidates. Failure to obtain trademark registrations may place our use of the trademarks at risk or
        make them subject to legal challenges, which could force us to choose alternative names for our product or product candidates. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities outside the United States conduct independent reviews of proposed
        product names for pharmaceuticals, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other pharmaceutical product names for medications. These regulatory authorities may also object to proposed product name if they believe the name
        inappropriately makes or implies a therapeutic claim. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities outside the United States object to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt alternative names for our product or product
        candidates. If we adopt alternative names, either because of our inability to obtain a trademark registration or because of objections from regulatory authorities, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications. As a result, we
        may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to adopt a new product name that would be registrable under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA and other
        regulatory authorities, which could adversely impact our product brand identity and successful commercialization of any product and increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a
        timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product or our product candidates.</div>

      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us
        to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:</div>

        less liquid than the average trading market for many other companies quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market.&#160; The quotation of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market
        currently exists. If an active trading market for our common stock does not sufficiently develop or continue, such an absence of an active trading market for our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders&#8217; ability to sell our common stock
        at then current market prices in short time periods.&#160; An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or
        technologies by using our common stock as consideration.&#160; Additionally, market visibility for our common stock may be limited and such lack of visibility may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock.</div>

        Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for &#8220;excess parachute payments.&#8221; Under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, the excise tax is triggered by change in control-related payments that, in general, equal or exceed three times Mr.
        Kendall&#8217;s or Mr. Schobel&#8217;s, as applicable, average annual taxable compensation over the five calendar years preceding the change in control. The excise tax equals 20% of the amount of the payment in excess of Mr. Kendall&#8217;s or Mr. Schobel&#8217;s, as
        applicable, average taxable compensation over the preceding five calendar year period (<font style="font-style: italic;">i.e., </font>the excess parachute payments). In addition to providing Mr. Kendall or Mr. Schobel with a tax gross-up payment,

      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; and in addition, we are also a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221;, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements
        applicable to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the JOBS Act, and a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221;, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth
        company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies,&#8221; including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements
        of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive
        compensation. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07
        billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal
        quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We also qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company,&#8221; which allows us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including reduced disclosure obligations regarding
        executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and certain reduced financial disclosures in our periodic reports, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we are eligible to remain a smaller reporting company,
        for so long as we have a public float (based on our common equity) of less than $250 million measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or a public float (based on our common equity) or less than $700
        million as of such date and annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year.&#160; We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some
        investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of these disclosure exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. As an emerging growth company, we
        have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, we expect to comply with new or revised accounting standards not later than
        the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public emerging growth companies.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent
        fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent
        fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section
        404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require
        prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
        information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We have incurred significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management has been required to devote substantial time to new
        compliance initiatives.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">As a public company, we now have and will continue to have significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not have as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as
        rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, have imposed various requirements on public companies. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant
        corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that required the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as &#8220;say on pay&#8221;. Stockholder activism, the current political environment
        and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact (in ways we cannot currently anticipate) the
        manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs
        and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur
        substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders would cause our stock price to fall.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders, including shares issued to employees and directors in respect of the termination of our Performance Unit
          Plans, or PUP Plans, in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are
          unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act have resulted
          in a substantial amount of these shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Future issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional
          dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have an equity incentive plan and we have granted and intend in the future to grant equity compensation awards to our employees and directors. We have registered all shares of common stock that we
          may issue under our stock-based compensation plans as a result, these shares, can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to the restrictions imposed under Rule 144 under the Securities Act (unless such shares have&#160; been
          registered by us for resale under a registration statement), which may cause our stockholders to experience additional dilution.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have incurred substantial losses since the inception of our company and do not expect to become profitable in the near future, if ever. Under the newly enacted federal income tax law, to the extent
          that we continue to generate taxable losses in 2019 and in future years, such unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, but our deductibility of such losses in a future year is generally limited to 80% of taxable
          income. Furthermore, under Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its
          pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be further limited. We believe that, with our initial public offering, we may have triggered an
          &#8220;ownership change&#8221; limitation. In addition, we have experienced and may in the future experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including an ownership change as a result of the combined
          effect of our initial public offering and future equity offerings. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset United States federal taxable income may be subject to
          limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do
          not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 18pt; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us,
          or may increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our
          stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions include:</div>

          behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware
          General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any other action asserting a claim against us that is

          incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage
          such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of

            prevents Actavis from entering the market until 2024.&#160; The case(s) against the remaining defendants regarding the additional asserted patents have not been finally resolved.&#160; A <font style="font-style: italic;">Markman </font>hearing in the
            cases against Dr. Reddy&#8217;s and Alvogen was held on October 17, 2019.&#160; On November 5, 2019, the Court issued its <font style="font-style: italic;">Markman</font> opinion construing the disputed terms of the asserted patents. On January 9, 2020,
            the Court entered into a stipulated order of non-infringement of the &#8216;305 patient based on the Court&#8217;s claim construction ruling, and we and Indivior preserved our rights to appeal the claim construction ruling.&#160; On November 19, 2019, the
            magistrate judge issued an order granting DRL and Alvogen&#8217;s requests to file amended answers to add antitrust counterclaims against us and Indivior.&#160; We and Indivior appealed the magistrate judge&#8217;s decision to the District Judge on December 4,
            2019, DRL and Alvogen opposed the appeal. The parties are awaiting further action from the Court on the appeal.&#160; On January 17, 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss DRL&#8217;s and Alvogen&#8217;s antitrust counterclaims for failure to state a claim and
            briefing on that motion is ongoing. No trial date has been set in those cases, which are pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. We are not able to determine or predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding.</div>

          Jersey vacated preliminary injunctions against both Dr. Reddy&#8217;s and Alvogen.&#160; Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, Alvogen, and Mylan all launched generic versions of Suboxone Sublingual Film, and the launches by Dr. Reddy&#8217;s and Alvogen are &#8220;at risk&#8221; because the

                      potential monetary damages. Shortly after the case was filed, BDSI filed four (4) IPR&#8217;s challenging the asserted &#8217;167 patent.&#160; On March 24, 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or the PTAB, issued a final written decision finding

                      BDSI&#8217;s motion to dismiss the Complaint without prejudice and denied BDSI&#8217;s motion to stay as moot.&#160; On November 11, 2019, we filed a new Complaint against BDSI in the Eastern District of North Carolina.&#160; On November 27, 2019, BDSI

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">On September 22, 2016, forty-one states and the District of Columbia, or the States, brought suit against Indivior and us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging
          violations of federal and state antitrust statutes and state unfair trade and consumer protection laws relating to Indivior&#8217;s launch of Suboxone Sublingual Film in 2010 and seeking an injunction, civil penalties, and disgorgement. After filing,
          the case was consolidated for pre-trial purposes with the <font style="font-style: italic;">In re Suboxone (Buprenorphine Hydrochloride and Naloxone) Antitrust Litigation</font>, MDL No. 2445, or the Suboxone MDL, a multidistrict litigation
          relating to putative class actions on behalf of various private plaintiffs against Indivior relating to its launch of Suboxone Sublingual Film. While we were not named as a defendant in the original Suboxone MDL cases, the action brought by the
          States alleges that we participated in an antitrust conspiracy with Indivior in connection with Indivior&#8217;s launch of Suboxone Sublingual Film and engaged in related conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust law. We moved to dismiss the
          States&#8217; conspiracy claims, but by order dated October 30, 2017, the Court denied our motion to dismiss. We filed an answer denying the States&#8217; claims on November 20, 2017. The fact discovery period closed July 27, 2018, but the parties agreed to
          conduct certain fact depositions in August 2018.&#160; The expert discovery phase closed May 30, 2019, but additional reports and depositions were conducted through August 1, 2019.&#160; <font style="font-style: italic;">Daubert</font> briefing is
          ongoing.&#160; The remainder of the case schedule, including summary judgment briefing, is stayed pending resolution of Indivior&#8217;s appeal of the district court&#8217;s class certification ruling in a co-pending multi-district litigation to which we are not
          a party.&#160; We are not able to determine or predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or provide a reasonable estimate, or range of estimates, of the possible outcome or loss, if any, in this matter.</div>

          Strike Neurelis&#8217;s Complaint under California&#8217;s anti-SLAPP (&#8220;strategic lawsuit against public participation&#8221;) statute on Friday, January 31, 2020, which Neurelis is expected to oppose.&#160; Neurelis filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental
          complaint on February 5, 2020, which we will oppose.&#160; A hearing on our anti-SLAPP motion and Neurelis&#8217;s motion for leave is scheduled for April 24, 2020.&#160; We are not able to determine or predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or provide

        <div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Overview</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing differentiated products which leverage our proprietary PharmFilm&#174; technology to solve patients&#8217; therapeutic problems and to
          meet patients&#8217; unmet medical needs. We have three commercial products, including one proprietary product and two out-licensed products, another FDA-approved product that has been out-licensed for commercialization in European markets following
          applicable regulatory approvals, as well as a late-stage proprietary product pipeline focused on the treatment of central nervous system, or CNS, diseases.&#160; We believe that the characteristics of the patient populations our products address and
          the shortcomings of available treatments create opportunities for the development and commercialization of meaningfully differentiated medicines. <br>
        </div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We generated revenue of $52,609 and $67,430 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, largely from commercial products licensed to our licensees in the form of manufacturing and supply revenue.&#160; Total revenues
          also included licensing, royalty and co-development and research fees.&#160; Our license revenue is subject to the normally uneven timing of co-development and licensing milestone payments, and to the variable product sales volumes achieved by our
          licensees, for which we receive royalties as well as manufacturing revenues. Suboxone, which was launched in 2010, was our first licensed pharmaceutical product to be commercialized, and we have other licensing relationships that contribute to
          our revenue and future revenue opportunities. Sympazan, which was launched in December 2018, is the first proprietary pharmaceutical product commercialized directly by the Company.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">In 2013, we made a strategic decision to develop our own pipeline of proprietary pharmaceutical products and to pursue commercialization of these products. Revenues from these development
            efforts began being realized in late 2018 with Sympazan, an oral soluble film formulation of clobazam used as an adjunctive therapy for seizures associated with a rare, intractable form of epilepsy know as Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, LGS.
            Following approval by the FDA we launched Sympazan in December 2018. Substantial investments have been made since 2013 in the development of our proprietary pipeline. We expect to continue these investments in the commercialization of Sympazan
            in 2020, and to invest in the pre-launch commercialization phase of the additional product candidates in our pipeline, assuming FDA approval. These development and commercialization expenses have utilized and, in the future will utilize, funds
            generated from licensing, manufacturing and proprietary related revenues and from our capital raising and debt financing.&#160; As of December 31, 2019, we had $49,326 in cash and cash equivalents. As a result of our investments in product
            development and recent investments in pre-launch commercialization initiatives, our historical operating expenses, and the settlement of obligations related to our Performance Unit Plan and our initial public offering completed in July 2018 and
            our recent offering of common stock in December 2019 coupled with our prior capitalization, we had net stockholders&#8217; deficit of $6,122 as of December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred net losses of $66,246
            and $61,376, respectively.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Exservan, utilizing Aquestive&#8217;s proprietary PharmFilm technology, has been developed for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).&#160; Exservan is expected to fulfill a critical need for ALS
          patients, since it can be orally administered safely and easily, twice daily without water.&#160; We believe that Exservan, can bring meaningful assistance to patients who are diagnosed with ALS and face difficulties swallowing or administering other
          forms of medication.&#160; Exservan was approved by the FDA on November 22, 2019.&#160; During the 2019 fourth quarter, we announced the granting of a license to Zambon S.p.A. for the development and commercialization of Exservan Oral Film in the EU for
          treatment of ALS.&#160; Zambon is a multinational pharmaceutical company with a focus on the CNS therapeutic area.&#160; Under the terms of the license agreement, an upfront payment was paid to Aquestive for the development and commercialization rights for
          Exservan in the EU, and we will be entitled to be paid, subject to the terms of the license agreement, development milestone payments and low double-digit royalties payable on net sales of the product in the EU.&#160; Zambon will exclusively be
          responsible for obtaining the regulatory approval and marketing of Exservan in the EU, and Aquestive will exclusively be responsible for the manufacture of the product.&#160; We are seeking an appropriate licensee for the commercialization rights for
          Exservan in the United States.</div>

        <div>
          <div style="color: #000000;">Libervant is a buccally, or inside of the cheek, administered soluble film formulation of diazepam. Epilepsy patients have been underserved for some time with little choice beyond device-based products such as
            rectally administered gels and a recently approved nasal spray.&#160; Aquestive is developing Libervant as an alternative to the current standard of care rescue therapy for patients with refractory epilepsy, which is a rectal gel that is invasive,
            inconvenient, and difficult to administer.&#160; As a result, a large portion of the patient population has not received adequate treatment or foregoes treatment altogether.&#160; It is anticipated that Libervant will enable a larger share of these
            patients to receive more appropriate treatment by providing consistent therapeutic dosing in a non-invasive and innovative treatment form for epileptic seizures.&#160; The Company filed an NDA for Libervant in November 2019.&#160; The filing was accepted
            by the FDA in February 2020 and we have received a PDUFA goal date of September 27, 2020.&#160; A competitive product with orphan drug exclusivity was approved in January 2020.&#160; We believe that Libervant will, if approved by the FDA, represent a
            &#8220;major contribution to patient care&#8221; within the meaning of FDA regulation and guidance, as compared to available treatment options, and further expand patient choice as the first orally administered dosage form available to manage seizure
            clusters in epilepsy patients.&#160;There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. More details on this product approval are described in detail in the &#8220;Our Product Portfolio and Pipeline&#8221; and &#8220;Competition&#8221; sections in Item

                    PharmFilm&#174; technologies.&#160; Epinephrine is the standard of care in the treatment of anaphylaxis and is currently administered via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. The current market leader is EpiPen&#174;, a single-dose, pre-filled
                    automatic injection device. As a result of its administration via subcutaneous or intra-muscular injection, many patients and their caregivers are reluctant to use currently available products, resulting in increased hospital visits and
                    overall cost of care to treat anaphylactic events. The data from the previously completed Phase 1 dose escalation study demonstrated that AQST-108 achieved similar ranges of mean values of maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to reach
                    maximum concentration (Tmax) to that reported for injectables EpiPen and Auvi-Q&#174;, provided a greater total exposure (AUC0-t; area under the curve) than that reported for EpiPen and Auvi-Q, had less interpatient variability when compared
                    to degree of variation (CV%) data reported for EpiPen and Auvi-Q, and was well tolerated, with no study participants discontinuing participation due to an adverse event. We believe that, as a result of its sublingual administration,
                    AQST-108 will improve patient compliance and lower the total cost of care. After a constructive pre-IND meeting with the FDA in early February, the Company is in the process of preparing the IND for AQST-108 expected to be submitted to
                    the FDA in the coming months.&#160; The Company expects to utilize the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway for AQST-108 and expects to begin clinical trials later in 2020.</div>

                      severe diarrhea and flushing associated with carcinoid syndrome.&#160; Acromegaly is a hormone disorder that results from the overproduction of growth hormone in middle-aged adults.&#160; Octreotide is the standard of care for the treatment of
                      acromegaly.&#160; The current market leader, Sandostatin, is administered via deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections once a month.&#160; This monthly treatment regimen can result in loss of efficacy toward the end of the monthly
                      treatment cycle.&#160; We are developing AQST-305 as a non-invasive, pain-free alternative to Sandostatin to reduce treatment burden, healthcare costs and the potential loss of efficacy of the treatment cycle.&#160; ASQST-305 has shown
                      promising preclinical results.&#160; We began a human proof of concept study in Canada during the third quarter of 2018.&#160; As a result of the early stage proof of concept study, further optimization of this formulation is currently
                      underway.</div>

          film formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone, for the treatment of opioid dependence. We have a sole and exclusive worldwide manufacturing agreement with Indivior to deliver both the branded Suboxone, globally through Indivior, and the
          authorized generic sublingual film formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone, which was distributed through Sandoz Inc. (&#8220;Sandoz&#8221;) for United States market.&#160; As of February 2020, the branded Suboxone accounted for approximately 43% of the oral
          film products prescribed in the U.S. for recovery from opioid addiction.&#160; See &#8220;Financial Operations Overview&#8221; below concerning Indivior&#8217;s announced intention to cease production of the authorized generic film product.</div>

          <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">In early 2019, certain third-party pharmaceutical companies launched, at risk, generic film products for buprenorphine-naloxone.&#160; Also, in early 2019, Indivior, through Sandoz, began to market
            and sell an authorized generic sublingual film product for Suboxone, which we also exclusively manufactured and supplied. On October 15, 2019, Indivior publicly announced that, in order to mitigate the impact from the recent passage of H.R. 438
            &#8211; Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019, which came into effect on October 1, 2019, and which includes changes to the methodology for calculating average manufacturer price for branded drugs, Indivior had given
            notice to Sandoz of Indivior&#8217;s intention to cease production of the authorized generic sublingual film product.&#160; As of early March 2020, Suboxone branded products retain approximately 43% of film market share. Indivior accounted for 86% and 89%
            of our total annual revenues for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.&#160; Our total revenue mix will shift to a higher proportionate share of proprietary product sales in future years as we continue to grow Sympazan revenues and pursue the launch
            of other products, assuming FDA approval.&#160; While volume is expected to decrease in 2020 for Suboxone branded only, our manufacturing price for Suboxone has been increased starting in the first quarter of 2020 which is expected to positively
            impact gross margin contribution from manufacturing and supply revenue.</div>

          shares, against which 428,571 common shares were issued in December 2019 upon exercise. The new financing provided net proceeds of $66,054 after expenses. The net proceeds of the financing were used to repay all outstanding obligations under the
          Company&#8217;s prior credit facility of $52,944. We used the remaining net cash proceeds of $13,110 for the continued commercialization and advancement of our proprietary products and pipeline candidates, and other general corporate purposes.&#160; Our

              Statement&#8221;).&#160; Under the S-3 Registration Statement we may sell up to $150 million of our securities including, without limitation, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and debt securities.&#160; </font><font style="color: rgb(31, 73, 125);">&#160;</font><font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On September 11, 2019, we entered into an equity distribution agreement to offer shares of our common stock from time to time in an &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; offering.&#160; We may offer and sell shares of common stock for an
              aggregate offering price of up to $25.0 million.&#160; No shares have been sold pursuant to this &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; offering as of the date of this report.&#160; The agreement does not have an expiration date but can be canceled by us at any time for
              convenience with 10 days written notice.&#160; On December 12, 2019, we sold 8,050,000 common shares for gross proceeds of $40,250 in an underwritten public offering under the S-3 Registration Statement, that netted $37,295 after the underwriting
              discount and offering costs. We have also reserved under the S-3 Registration Statement up to an additional 4,228,082 shares of our common stock for sale by our stockholders and for the exercise of warrants held by the holders of our 12.5%
              Senior Secured Notes.&#160; Under our S-3 Registration Statement we are subject to, among other requirements applicable to our continuing eligibility to offer and sell securities pursuant to that short-form registration statement, the &#8220;baby shelf&#8221;
              registration requirements, which generally provide that a registrant which does not satisfy a minimum public float requirement (determined by the market value of publicly-traded shares held by nonaffiliates of the registrant) of at least $75
              million at the time it files its Form S-3 registration statement, may not offer and sell in a primary offering more than one-third of its public float in any twelve month period (the &#8220;one-third limit&#8221;). However, if a registrant who did not
              satisfy the minimum public float requirement at the time of filing of its Form S-3 registration statement, subsequently increases its public float in excess of $75 million (determined as of any date within 60 days prior to the filing of its
              Form 10-K), the one-third limit will not apply for the twelve month period until the public float determination is once again made in connection with its next subsequently filed Form 10-K, assuming for this purpose compliance with all other
              Form S-3 primary offering and other requirements. As of a date within 60 days prior to our filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our public float held by nonaffiliates was in excess of $75 million and therefore the one-third limit does
              not apply, assuming that we otherwise satisfy all other Form S-3 offering requirements and subject to the re-determination of this public float test in connection with the filing of our next Annual Report on Form 10-K. We cannot assure that
              we will at all times satisfy the minimum public float requirement or other requirements for eligibility for primary offerings under the Form S-3 registration requirements.</font></div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our business has been financed through a combination of revenue from licensed product and proprietary product activities, proceeds from our IPO, equity investments and other equity issuances, and
          proceeds from our debt instruments and facilities. Significant additional funding is expected to be required in order to execute our business strategy and operations.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Until we become profitable, if ever, we expect to need to raise significant additional capital through equity or debt issuances, or both, in the future to further the development, regulatory approval,
          commercialization and marketing of our products and product candidates, and to conduct our business. We have no committed sources of additional capital, and there can be no assurance that such needed capital or debt financing will be available on
          favorable terms, or at all. We have options to seek to obtain additional financing in the future through the issuance of our common stock, through other public or private equity or debt financings, through potential non-dilutive capital raising
          events that may result from royalty streams that may be realizable from our licensed products, and through collaborations or licensing arrangements with other companies or other means, if available. We may not be able to raise additional capital
          or other funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and any failure to raise capital as and when needed could compromise our ability to execute on our business plan and cause us to delay or curtail our operations until such funding is
          received. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuance of equity securities, our stockholders would experience dilution, and debt financings, if available (and subject to all of the existing restrictions and conditions under the
          Indenture for the Senior Secured Notes) may involve increased restrictive covenants and increased fixed payments or may otherwise further constrain our financial flexibility. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborative or
          licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our intellectual property or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. In addition, payments made by potential collaborators or licensors generally will depend
          upon our achievement of negotiated development and regulatory milestones. Failure to achieve these milestones may harm our future capital position.&#160; See &#8220;Funding Requirements&#8221; below for a discussion of Aquestive&#8217;s cash needs.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our revenues to date have been earned from our product development pipeline, marketed product activities and self-developed medicines. These activities generate revenues in four primary categories:
          manufacturing and supply revenue, co-development and research fees, license and royalty revenue, and proprietary product sales, net.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Manufacture and Supply Revenue</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Currently, we produce two licensed pharmaceutical products: Suboxone and Zuplenz. We are the exclusive manufacturer for these products. We manufacture based on receipt of purchase orders from our
          licensees, and our licensees have an obligation to accept these filled orders once quality assurance validates the quality of the manufactured product. In 2019 under ASC 606, we record revenues once the manufactured product passes quality
          control.&#160; Our licensees are responsible for all other aspects of commercialization of these products and the Company has no role in or ability to participate in commercialization including marketing, pricing, sales and regulatory strategy.&#160; In
          2018 under ASC 605, we recorded revenues when product is shipped and title passed to the customers.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We expect future manufacture and supply revenue from licensed products to be based on volume demand for such licensed products and manufacturing and supply rights under new collaborations for product
          development and additional licensing of our intellectual property.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Co-development and Research Fees</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We work with our licensees to co-develop pharmaceutical products. In this regard, we earn fees through performance of specific tasks, activities, or completion of stages of development defined within
          a contractual arrangement with the relevant licensee. The nature and extent of these performance obligations, broadly referred to as milestones or deliverables, are usually dependent on the scope and structure of the project as contracted, as
          well as the complexity of the product and the specific regulatory approval path necessary for that product.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">License and Royalty Revenue</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Once a viable product opportunity is identified from our co-development and research activities, including with our licensees, we may out-license to our licensees the rights to utilize our
          intellectual property related to their marketing of such products globally. As a result, we earn revenue from license fees received under such license, development and supply agreements. We also may earn royalties based on our licensees&#8217; sales of
          products that use our intellectual property that are marketed and sold in the countries where we patented technology rights.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Proprietary Product Sales</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">As we commercialize our proprietary CNS product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval to market such product, beginning with Sympazan, we may directly sell such product to consumers in
          the United States, resulting in an additional source of revenue which we refer to as proprietary product sales. We commercialized our first proprietary CNS product, Sympazan, in December 2018.&#160; We currently sell Sympazan through wholesalers for
          distribution through retail pharmacies.&#160; Additionally, we may choose to select a licensee to commercialize our product candidates in certain markets inside and outside of the United States. To date, the only revenue generated from our
          self-developed and self-commercialized pharmaceutical products is from the sale of Sympazan in the United States.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Revenues from sales of products are recorded net of prompt payment discounts, wholesaler service fees, returns allowances, rebates and co-pay card redemptions, each of which are described in more
          detail below. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These amounts are treated as variable consideration, estimated and recognized as a reduction of the transaction price at the time of
          the sale. The Company includes these estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with
          the variable consideration is resolved. The calculation of some of these items requires management to make estimates based on sales data, historical return data, contracts and other related information that may become known in the future. The
          adequacy of these provisions is reviewed on a quarterly basis.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The prompt pay reserve is based upon discounts offered to wholesalers as an incentive to meet certain payment terms.&#160; We accrue discounts to wholesalers based on contractual terms of agreements.&#160; We
          account for these discounts at the time of sale as a reduction to gross product sales and a reduction to accounts receivable.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our customers include major national and regional wholesalers with whom we have contracted a fee for service based on a percentage of gross product sales.&#160; This fee for service is recorded as a
          reduction to gross product sales and an increase to accrued expenses at the time of sale and is recorded based on the contracted percentage.</div>
        <div><br>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We allow customers to return product that is damaged or received in error.&#160; In addition, we allow Sympazan to be returned beginning six months prior to, and twelve months following, product
          expiration.&#160; We estimate our sales returns reserve based on industry averages until such time that we have accumulated enough data to apply a historical trend analysis.&#160; The returns reserve is recorded at the time of sale as a reduction to gross
          product sales and accounts receivable.</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Rebates include third party managed care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D rebates and other government rebates.&#160; Rebates are accrued based upon an estimate of claims to be paid for product sold into
          trade by the Company.&#160; The provisions for government rebates were based on contractual terms and government regulations.&#160; We monitor legislative changes to determine what impact such legislation might have on our Company. We account for these
          deductions as a reduction of gross product sales and an increase in accrued expenses.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Co-pay support costs represent the costs to help offset a customer&#8217;s co-pay or cover a predetermined amount of prescription costs based on business rules.&#160; We account for these deductions as a
          reduction of gross product sales and an increase in accrued expenses.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our costs and expenses are primarily the result of the following activities: generation of manufacture and supply revenues; development of and the regulatory approval process for our pipeline of
          proprietary product candidates and selling, general and administrative expenses, including pre-launch and post launch commercialization efforts related to our CNS product candidates, intellectual property procurement, protection, prosecution and
          litigation expenses, corporate management functions, public company costs, share-based compensation expenses and interest on our corporate borrowings. We primarily record our costs and expenses in the following categories:</div>

        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Manufacture and Supply Costs and Expenses</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Manufacture and supply costs and expenses are comprised primarily of costs and expenses related to manufacturing our proprietary dissolving film products for our marketed licensed pharmaceutical
          products and for our newly approved proprietary products including raw materials, direct labor and fixed overhead principally in our Portage, Indiana facilities.&#160; Our material costs include the costs of raw materials used in the production of our
          proprietary dissolving film and primary packaging materials. Direct labor costs consist of payroll costs (including taxes and benefits) of employees engaged in production activities. Fixed and semi-fixed overhead principally consists of indirect
          payroll, facilities rent, utilities and depreciation for leasehold improvements and production machinery and equipment.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our manufacture and supply costs and expenses are impacted by our customers&#8217; supply requirements. Costs of production reflect the costs of raw materials that are purchased at market prices and
          production efficiency (measured by the cost of a salable unit).&#160; These costs can increase or decrease based on the amount of direct labor and materials required to produce a product and the allocation of fixed overhead, which is dependent on the
          levels of production.</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We will continue to seek to rationalize and reduce costs to reflect the declining production volumes of Suboxone.&#160; We reduced the cost of manufacturing and supply in late 2019 in order to recognize
          the declining volume of Suboxone that begin in 2019 and will continue declining in 2020. We expect our manufacture and supply costs and expenses to decrease over the next several years due to the decline in Suboxone volumes as the generics in
          that market continue to&#160; take market share, modestly offset by the commercialization of our proprietary products, starting with Sympazan launched in December 2018.&#160; In addition to our proprietary products coming online, we may add licensee
          products which may need additional resources to manufacture.&#160; If such growth should occur for higher volume product opportunities such as Suboxone we would incur increased costs associated with hiring additional personnel to support the increased
          manufacturing and supply costs arising from higher manufactured volumes from proprietary and licensed products.</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We expect our research and development expenses to continue to be significant over the next several years as we continue to develop existing product candidates such as AQST-108 and we expand our
          efforts to identify and develop or acquire additional product candidates and technologies.&#160; We may hire or engage additional skilled colleagues or third parties to perform these activities, conduct clinical trials and ultimately seek regulatory
          approvals for any product candidate that successfully completes those clinical trials.</div>

        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Selling, General and Administrative Expenses</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, share-based compensation, commercialization and marketing costs and other related costs for executive, finance,
          selling and operational personnel. Other significant costs include facility and related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses such as: professional fees for legal, consulting, tax and accounting services; insurance;
          selling; market research; advisory board and key opinion leaders; depreciation; and general corporate expenses, inclusive of IT systems related costs.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Costs related to the commercialization of our CNS products began in the second half of 2017 and significantly increased in 2018 leading up to the launch of Sympazan in December 2018.&#160; Significant
          investments in commercialization were made in 2019.&#160; We will continue to invest in the commercialization of Sympazan in 2020 but those costs will be rationalized to the expected near-term opportunity Sympazan represents.&#160; In the late part of the
          year we would expect additional expenses to occur in order to launch Libervant should it be approved.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;"></div>
        <div>
          <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">Sympazan is the precursor and compliment to the launch of Libervant if it is approved and granted access to market.&#160; There is a very high degree of overlap and correlation between prescribers
            of Sympazan and the likely prescribers of an approved Libervant.&#160; While Sympazan continues to grow, we will continue to rationalize its contribution as a product, its value as way to introduce prescribers to the epilepsy market to Aquestive and
            Pharmfilm technology and the investment we are making in this form of commercialization and marketing spend supporting it.&#160; The current commercial organization would launch Libervant, subject to its approval, without expecting to immediately
            add costs, although marketing and selling expenses will increase if Libervant is approved and ready to be marketed.&#160; Until any Libervant launch is clear, we do not plan to increase the costs of our commercial organization and will continue to
            improve the efficiency of the Sympazan commercial investments.</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">&#160;&#160;As part of the commercial launch of Sympazan, we entered into contractual arrangements with a third-party logistics provider (3PL) and wholesalers for distribution of our products.&#160; We also entered
          into arrangements for our contracted sales force, market access and medical affairs teams. With this increased activity related to the commercial launch of Sympazan, our sales and marketing expenses increased in 2019.&#160; Our general and
          administrative costs increased as a result of becoming a public company, including costs related to additional personnel and accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange
          listing and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs.&#160; We continue to incur significant costs in seeking to protect our intellectual property rights, including significant litigation costs in
          connection with seeking to enforce our rights concerning third parties&#8217; at-risk launch of generic products.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We will continue to manage business costs to appropriately reflect the declining state of Suboxone revenues, the marketing and sales costs related to Sympazan and other external factors affecting our
          business as we continue to focus on the core drivers of value to our stockholders:</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Revenues decreased 22% or $14,821 in 2019 to $52,609 compared to $67,430 in 2018. The change is primarily attributable to differences in license and royalty revenue and co-development and research
          fees that by their respective nature are variable as to timing and magnitude,&#160; offset in part by increases in manufacture and supply revenue and proprietary product sales revenue from Sympazan, launched in December 2018. Additionally, under the
          Indivior Supplemental Agreement license fees which are variable are currently suspended following the &#8220;at risk&#8221; launches of several generic buprenorphine-naloxone products into the Suboxone market.&#160; These may be recoverable in the future under
          certain conditions.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Manufacture and supply revenue increased approximately 4% or $1,420 in 2019 to $38,739 as compared to $37,319 in 2018 due to increased pricing associated with our Suboxone product which began in late
          2018 and continued in 2019, offset in part by total lower volumes of Suboxone and the Suboxone authorized generic.&#160; As discussed above, Indivior announced in the fourth quarter 2019 its intention to cease the sale and marketing of the authorized
          generic, which will impact our manufacturing and supply revenue beginning in 2020.&#160; The branded Suboxone products have continued to experience market share erosion as generic competition continues to take more market share. We continue to plan
          for the further erosion of this sunsetting product over time.</div>
        <div><br>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">License and royalty revenue decreased 72% or $17,740 in 2019 to $6,959 compared to $24,699 in 2018. This decrease was primarily related to license fees on our licensed products Suboxone and
          APL-130277(Apomorphine).&#160; License fees totaled $5,806 in the 2019 period compared to $23,500 of license fees recognized during the 2018 period.&#160; Suboxone related license fees were $15,250 lower in 2019 as compared to those of 2018 while
          Apomorphine related license fees were $4,000 less in 2019 when compared to 2018. Suboxone related license fees were lower compared to 2018 as a result of two factors:&#160; the uneven timing and magnitude of the various payments owed to the Company by
          Indivior and the fact that certain license fees due from Indivior have been suspended pending the outcome of litigation related to infringement claims against generic products launched &#8220;at risk&#8221;.&#160; Included in license and royalty revenue was
          $1,000 from our 10% share of milestone payments paid to KemPharm during September 2019 under its licensing of KP-415 and KP-484.&#160; There can be no assurance that any such payments will likely be made in the future. Milestones from other licensed
          products such as Sunovion&#8217;s APL-130277 product are expected to be earned after 2019 based on Sunovion&#8217;s announcement of a May 21, 2020 PDUFA goal date and an expected launch commercially later in 2020, subject to Apomorphine being approved by the
          FDA.&#160; Royalty revenues earned on Suboxone and Zuplenz increased modestly year-over-year on similar product sales volumes flowing through our licensees&#8217; sales and distribution channels.&#160; License fees are generally driven by transfer of rights,
          patent performance contingencies, specific FDA or other regulatory achievements, sales levels achievements or other contingencies and milestones, and will likely fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Co-development and research fees decreased 22% or $1,142 in 2019 to $4,042 compared to $5,184 in 2018. The decrease was driven by the timing of the achievement of research and development performance
          obligations on licensed products, and related milestones, both of which are normally expected to fluctuate significantly one reporting period to the next.</div>

          generic products in 2019 compared to 2018 as well as the non-cash reversal of an accrual for manufacturing related costs that no longer represented an obligation of the Company.&#160; Further there was a $194 decrease in share-based compensation
          expenses during 2019 as compared to 2018.&#160; These decreases were offset, in part by $4,093 of higher standard production costs and unfavorable mix of produced product period over period.</div>

          expenses and associated with the issuance of non-voting common shares and related withholding taxes, which the Company elected to pay on behalf of the former performance unit holders in 2018, approximately $700 in lower personnel costs period
          over period and decreased project spend driven by the timing of clinical trial activities on our proprietary products in development.&#160; These decreases were offset in part by $323 of increased share-based compensation period over period.</div>

          <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 11% or $7,927 to $64,342 in 2019 as compared to $72,269 in 2018 primarily due to $24,767 of compensation cost allocable to selling,
            general and administrative expenses and associated with the issuance of the non-voting common shares and related withholding taxes, which the Company elected to pay on behalf of the former performance unit holders in 2018. This decrease was
            offset in part by $5,687 of higher investments in our commercialization activities for Sympazan.&#160; These costs included those for internal and contracted personnel, external consultants and other resources that enabled us to establish key
            commercial functions such as sales and marketing, market access and medical affairs.&#160; In addition, in 2019, we incurred increases of $3,944 in share-based compensation expense; $1,472 in legal fees in connection with the ongoing state antitrust
            litigation and other patent related matters, and $1,508 in insurance premiums, as the largest components of the change in selling, general and administrative expenses.</div>

          interest costs, and this increase was further impacted by higher amortization of debt discount and&#160; loan acquisition costs associated with the issuance of our Senior Secured Notes due 2025.&#160; Prior to July 15, 2019, our interest expense was
          subject to fluctuations based on one-month LIBOR and was approximately 12% to12.5% during that earlier part of 2019.&#160; Our new Senior Secured Notes due 2025 issued on July 15, 2019 carry a 12.5% fixed interest rate per annum, with an increased
          principal amount outstanding thereunder.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Interest income increased 15% or $84 in 2019 as compared to 2018, as a result of investing the net cash proceeds from our equity offering which occurred in December 2019 and the refinancing of our
          debt facility in July 2019 in an interest-bearing account.</div>

          <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">Loss on the extinguishment of debt was $4,896 in 2019 which represented the expenses associated with early extinguishment of our loan&#8217;s payable with Perceptive.&#160; The amount consists of $2,944
            related to the prepayment premium associated with early payment of our outstanding obligations to Perceptive along with unamortized debt discount and unamortized loan acquisition costs of $1,606 and $346, respectively.</div>

        <div><br>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Other expenses decreased by $5,278 in 2019 compared to 2018, principally due to the expense incurred associated with the fair value of Perceptive warrants.&#160; For periods prior to our IPO, which was
          closed on July 27, 2018, we remeasured the fair value of outstanding warrants each quarter in accordance with the AICPA Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities issued as compensation.&#160; Market pricing of $15.00, the
          initial price at which the Company&#8217;s common stock was offered, was used in determining fair value at the time of exercise of those warrants.&#160; For information concerning the warrants issued in connection with our 12.5% Senior Secured Notes due
          2025 issued on July 18, 2019, see Note 12, 12.5% Senior Secured Notes, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.</div>

          discounts, commissions, and offering related transaction costs of approximately $9,957. On August 15, 2018, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option and the Company issued 425,727 additional shares at $15.00 per share.&#160; The Company
          received additional net proceeds of approximately $5,939, after deducting underwriter discounts of approximately $447. The Company&#8217;s IPO produced total gross proceeds of approximately $73,886 and we received net proceeds of approximately $63,482,

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">On July 15, 2019, we issued $70,000 aggregate principal amount of our 12.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and Warrants under the Indenture for such Senior Secured Notes (&#8220;Indenture&#8221;). In addition, the
          Indenture provides opportunity to issue up to $30,000 of additional Notes under certain conditions for a total possible issuance amount of $100,000.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The net proceeds from the Senior Secured Notes were $66,054, after deducting expenses of the transaction. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay an aggregate amount of&#160; $52,092 of existing
          indebtedness, comprised of the outstanding principal amount, all accrued and unpaid interest and applicable prepayment and end-of-term fees, owed to Perceptive under the Credit Agreement and Guaranty (described below). We used the remaining net
          cash proceeds of approximately $13,110 for the continued commercialization and advancement of our proprietary products and pipeline candidates, and other general corporate purposes. <br>

        <div><br>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The additional Senior Secured Notes can be issued if we satisfy certain conditions and achieve certain milestones related to the filing and approval of our epilepsy product candidate Libervant and
          there are available purchasers for the additional Senior Secured Notes.&#160; Specifically, on or prior to March 31, 2021, we have the option to issue an additional $10,000 aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes if we filed a new drug
          application for our candidate Libervant with the FDA, provided we have obtained the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Senior Secured Notes, in its discretion, which cannot be assured (first
          reopener), and, on or prior to March 31, 2021, up to an additional $30,000 (less the amount of any first additional Senior Secured Notes issued by us) if the Company obtains approval from the FDA to market Libervant in the U.S.&#160; There can be no

          <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">Under the Indenture, we have the right to monetize our royalty and milestone interests in our licensed product, Apomorphine APL-130277, which would not be expected prior to FDA approval of the
            product.&#160; Upon any such monetization we may offer to purchase each holder&#8217;s Senior Secured Notes on a pro rata basis at a repurchase price in cash equal to 112.5% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued interest and unpaid interest,
            if any, thereon to the repurchase date. The maximum amount that can be offered for repurchase is $40,000, or $50,000 if the first reopener has been issued and funded.&#160; The amount of Senior Secured Notes repurchased will be at the discretion of
            the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.&#160; See Note 11, 12.5% Senior Secured Notes, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.&#160; To the extent that the Noteholders do not elect repayment of the debt in connection with any such monetization, the
            amount not elected up to $40 million (or $50 million if the first reopener has been funded) is required to be held in a collateral account until Libervant is approved by the FDA to be marketed in the U.S.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Indenture permits us, upon the continuing satisfaction of certain conditions, including that we (on a consolidated basis) have at least $75,000 of net revenues for the most recently completed
          twelve calendar month period, to enter into an asset-based borrowing facility (&#8220;ABL Facility&#8221;) not to exceed $10,000.&#160; The ABL Facility may be collateralized by assets constituting only inventory, accounts receivable and the proceeds thereof of

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Indenture also restricts the incurrence of additional indebtedness except only such indebtedness as is expressly permitted under the terms of the Indenture (which includes the ABL Facility) on the
          terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture and such indebtedness as may be permitted under limitations set forth in the Indenture.&#160; The Indenture also restricts the issuance of any &#8220;Disqualified Stock&#8221; including, generally, mandatorily
          redeemable securities or securities redeemable at the option of the holder or securities convertible or exchangeable at the option of the holder for indebtedness of the Company or for other Disqualified Stock.</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Events of default under the Indenture include various commonly specified conditions including, but not limited to, bankruptcy, insolvency, material adverse changes, failure to meet Indenture payment
          or other obligations, compliance with regulatory requirements and preservation of the corporate existence and business operations of the Company.&#160; As of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with covenants under the Indenture.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In connection with this financing, we issued to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes unregistered Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $4.25 per
          Warrant.&#160; Warrants for 428,571 of common shares were exercised in December 2019 generating proceeds of $1,820.&#160; The Company registered the Warrants and associated shares as part of our S-3 Registration described above.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">On August 16, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement and Guarantee with Perceptive Credit Opportunities Fund, which we amended on May 21, 2018, or, as so amended, the Loan Agreement. At closing, we
          borrowed $45,000 under the Loan Agreement and were permitted to borrow up to an additional $5,000 within one year of the closing date based on achievement of a defined milestone. In March 2017, we met our performance obligations under the terms
          of the Loan Agreement and received the remaining $5,000 available to us under the Loan Agreement. Proceeds under the Loan Agreement were used to repay an existing debt obligation of $37,500, with the balance available for general corporate
          purposes. The loan from Perceptive was originally scheduled to mature on August 16, 2020.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Upon the consummation of our IPO, the maturity date was extended to December 16, 2020. The loan bore interest, payable monthly, at one-month LIBOR, plus 9.75%, subject to a minimum rate of 11.75%. The
          loan was interest-only through April 2019, as amended.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Additionally, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, commencing on May 31, 2019, seven monthly principal payments were due in the amount of $550. Thereafter, monthly principal payments in the amount of $750
          were due through the maturity date (as extended), at which time the full amount of the remaining outstanding loan balance was due. Our tangible and intangible assets were subject to first priority liens. Other significant terms included financial
          covenants, change of control triggers and limitations on additional indebtedness, asset sales, acquisitions and dividend payments. The Loan Agreement contained certain financial covenants, which included (1) a minimum liquidity requirement
          pursuant to which we were required to maintain a monthly cash balance of $4,000 at all times and (2) a minimum revenue requirement pursuant to which on a quarterly basis (calculation date) we were required to maintain minimum revenues for the
          twelve consecutive trailing months ended prior to the calculation date. Further, under the Loan Agreement, as amended, we were permitted, subject to Perceptive&#8217; s consent, to monetize the royalty and fees derived from sales of certain Apomorphine
          products and, in connection with such monetization, Perceptive had agreed to release liens related to these royalties and fees.&#160; Further, the Loan Agreement originally contained a requirement that we make a mandatory prepayment in the amount of
          25% of the net cash proceeds to us upon consummation of our IPO; however, as amended, in connection with the consummation of our IPO, such requirement did not apply.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Upon the closing of our IPO, Perceptive received 863,400 shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the automatic exercise of warrants from APL&#8217;s ownership interest for a total exercise price of

          offset by (2) non-cash operating expenses totaling $17,160 and by (3) use of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $11,124. The non-cash operating expenses of $17,160 primarily resulted from $7,071 of share-based compensation
          expense, the $4,896 loss on the extinguishment of debt and $5,193 related to other non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization and amortization of debt issuance costs.</div>

          offset by (2) non-cash operating expenses totaling $40,387 and by (3) cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $7,998. The non-cash operating expenses of $40,387 primarily resulted from $29,940 of share-based compensation
          which included $27,298 related to the termination of the Company&#8217;s Performance Unit Plans in the second quarter of 2018 and $2,642 of share-based compensation expense recorded in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2018.&#160; Other significant
          components included non-cash charges of $5,278 related to an increase in the fair value of the Perceptive warrants through the date of exercise and $5,169 related to other non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization and amortization of

          cash provided in 2019 is the result of the proceeds from the issuance of our 12.5% Senior Secured Notes of $13,110, after repayment of the existing Perceptive Loan Agreement; net proceeds derived from our equity offering in December 2019 of
          $37,295; and&#160; various other proceeds from the exercise of warrants by noteholders of our 12.5% Senior Secured Notes and purchases under the Company&#8217;s employee stock purchase plan.&#160; Additionally, in 2019 we used $2,827 for withholding taxes
          associated with tax reimbursement payments from the share-based compensation recorded during 2018.&#160;&#160; Net cash provided by financing activities was $58,035 for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily a result of $63,946 of net

        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We continue to be in the process of transitioning to a company newly commercializing its self-developed products, with our commercialization activities first beginning in December
          2018 with regulatory approval of our first proprietary product Sympazan.&#160; For our commercialization efforts to be successful we must continue to train, deploy and further develop an effective sales and marketing organization and infrastructure.&#160;
          To become and remain profitable we must continue to develop, obtain timely regulatory approval of, and successfully commercialize or otherwise out-license or monetize, those of our proprietary products and product candidates that we believe will
          have the most market potential and commercial success.&#160; We may encounter difficulties and delays in the regulatory approval process for our drug candidates, including Libervant and our commercialization efforts may take longer to achieve than
          planned.&#160; Our business or operations may change and we may also encounter unanticipated or unbudgeted events or expenses that may require cash resources more rapidly than planned. We are unable to determine or forecast with certainty when or if

            research and development activities, pre-clinical activities, clinical trials, regulatory approval activities, and commercialization activities. We will continue to seek to rationalize our costs as Suboxone revenue declines.&#160; Additionally, we
            will seek to conservatively manage our pre-launch spending as to both timing and level relating to Libervant, including seeking to rationalize the costs associated with marketing and selling Sympazan.&#160; In this regard, absent spending on launch
            activities for Libervant we expect to spend less on commercialization in 2020 compared to 2019.&#160; Even as such, we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows and we therefore we expect to be dependent upon external financing and

          after transaction expenses.&#160; In connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, we repaid approximately $52,092 representing all amounts outstanding or due under our Perceptive debt facility.&#160; The Indenture governing the Senior Secured
          Notes provides opportunity to potentially issue in the future up to an aggregate of $30,000 of additional Senior Secured Notes based on our satisfaction of certain conditions and requirements under the Indenture, which we cannot assure, and
          having available purchasers of such additional Senior Secured Notes.&#160; The Indenture also permits us, upon the continuing satisfaction of certain conditions, including that we (on a consolidated basis) have at least $75,000 of net revenues for the
          most recently completed twelve calendar month period, to enter into an asset-based borrowing facility not to exceed $10,000 (the &#8220;ABL Facility&#8221;).&#160; The ABL Facility may be collateralized by assets constituting only inventory, accounts receivable
          and the proceeds of the Company.&#160; See &#8220;12.5% Senior Secured Notes&#8221; above.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt;"><font style="color: #000000;">On September 11, 2019, we filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective on September 17, 2019 (File No. 333-233716) (the S-3 Registration
            Statement&#8221;).&#160; Under the S-3 Registration Statement we may sell up to $150 million of our securities, including without limitation, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and debt securities.&#160; </font><font style="color: #1F487C;">&#160;</font><font style="color: #000000;">On September 11, 2019, we entered into an equity distribution agreement to offer shares of our common stock from time to time in an &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; offering.&#160; We may offer and sell shares of common stock for an aggregate
            offering price of up to $25.0 million.&#160; No shares have been sold pursuant to this agreement as of the date of this report.&#160; The equity distributions agreement does not have an expiration date but can be canceled by us at any time for
            convenience with 10 days written notice.&#160; In December 2019, we sold $40,250 in common stock in an underwritten public offering under the S-3 Registration Statement, further described below.&#160;&#160; We have also reserved under the S-3 Registration
            Statement up to an additional 4,228,082 shares of our common stock for sale by our stockholders and pursuant to the exercise of warrants held by our stockholders.</font></div>

        <div>
          <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">Unless and until we become profitable, we will continue to need to raise additional capital and/or other financing or funding, any of which could be material, to further advance the development
            of our other product candidates, most importantly Libervant and AQST-108, which are subject to regulatory approval, and commercialization of our product candidates and to meet our other cash requirements, including debt service. We do not
            currently have any committed external sources of financing. Our ability to secure additional equity financing could be significantly impacted by numerous factors including our operating performance and prospects, positive or negative
            developments in the regulatory approval process for our proprietary products, timely achievement of regulatory approval of our late-stage proprietary products, our existing level of debt which is secured by substantially all of our assets,
            restrictions under our Senior Secured Note Indenture, and general market conditions, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in raising equity capital or that any such needed financing will be available, available
            on favorable or acceptable terms or at the times or in the amounts needed. We may also seek to obtain additional funding in the future through the monetization of royalty streams from our product Apomorphine, subject to regulatory approval
            thereof, which product candidate is licensed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (and subject to the conditions and requirements under the Indenture for our 12.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 including our note repurchase obligations at the
            option of the holders), but we cannot assure of any such royalty streams or monetization.</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our ability to obtain any additional indebtedness or other debt financing is limited by the terms of the Indenture for our Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture also restricts or
          prohibits certain types of equity financing (see &#8220;12.5% Senior Secured Notes&#8221; above).&#160; To the extent we are able to obtain needed funding through additional debt financing, any such debt financing me be coupled with an equity component, such as
          warrants for our shares, which could also result in dilution to our stockholders.&#160; The incurrence of additional debt would also result in increased fixed payment obligations.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We may also seek to obtain additional funding through third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and
          licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. We may not be able to raise additional capital or other funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and any failure to raise additional capital or other funding as and when needed
          for our cash requirements would have a negative impact on our business, prospects and financial condition and on our ability to execute and achieve our business plan and cause us to delay or curtail our operations until such funding is received.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuance of equity securities, our stockholders would experience further dilution and the terms of these securities could include
          liquidation or other preferences (if and to the extent permitted under the Indenture) that would adversely affect our stockholders&#8217; rights.&#160; To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborative, strategic alliances or licensing
          arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish (subject to required consent under our Indenture for the disposition or transfer of assets other than Apomorphine) valuable rights to our intellectual property or future revenue
          or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or that we may not otherwise consider relinquishing or granting, including rights to future product candidates. In addition, payments made by potential collaborators or licensors generally
          will depend upon our achievement of negotiated development and regulatory milestones. Failure to achieve these milestones may harm our future liquidity and funding position.</div>

        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">If adequate funds are not available for our short-term or longer-term liquidity needs and cash requirements as and when needed, we may be required to reduce staff, delay,
          significantly scale back, or even discontinue some or all of our research and development programs and clinical and other product development activities, or reduce our planned commercialization efforts and otherwise significantly reduce our other
          spend and adjust our operating plan, and we would need to seek to take other steps intended to improve our liquidity. We also may be required to evaluate additional licensing opportunities, if any become available, of our proprietary product
          candidate programs that we currently plan to self-commercialize or explore other potential liquidity opportunities or other alternatives or options or strategic alternatives, although we cannot assure that any of these actions would be available
          or available on reasonable terms.</div>

        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our costs associated with operating as a new public company have increased, and we expect to incur additional costs to support the obligation of a public company to various
          regulatory agencies, to investors and in order to comply with certain legislation and regulations.&#160; These expenditures include the costs of additional employees with specific skills and experiences such as SEC reporting, higher insurance expense,

        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have entered into various lease agreements for production and research facilities and offices. Most leases contain renewal options. Certain leases contain purchase options and require us to pay for
          taxes, maintenance and operating expenses. All of our leases are currently classified as operating leases. See Item 2 Properties for a further description.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We have based our Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
          generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the U.S. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
          financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition, inventory costs, liabilities and accruals,
          clinical trial expenses, share-based compensation and the valuation of deferred tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience when available and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
          results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">While significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this filing, we
          believe that the following accounting policies are those that are most critical to the significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Revenue Recognition</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our Company&#8217;s revenues to date have been earned from licensed commercialized products, research and development services provided to customers, licensing of patent-protected intellectual property and
          commercialization of a proprietary product. These activities generate revenues in four primary categories: manufacturing and supply revenue, co-development and research fees, license and royalty revenue, and proprietary product sales, net.&#160; In
          the future, as other proprietary products may become commercially marketed, the relative weight of these two revenue types is expected to shift in favor of our self-developed CNS and other pipeline product candidates.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, <font style="font-style: italic;">Revenue for Contracts with Customers</font>, and subsequently issued a number of amendments to this update.&#160; The new
          standard, as amended, or ASC 606, provides a single comprehensive model to be used in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance.&#160; The standard&#8217;s core principle is that an
          entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Performance Obligations</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in the current revenue standard.&#160; A contract&#8217;s transaction price
          is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.&#160; At contract inception, we assess the goods promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance
          obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a good that is distinct.&#160; When identifying our performance obligations, we consider all goods or services promised in the contract regardless of whether explicity stated in the contract or
          implied by customary business practice. Our performance obligations consist of mainly of transferring of goods and services identified in the contracts, purchase orders or invoices.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Company&#8217;s performance obligation with respect to its proprietary product sales is satisfied at a point in time which transfers control upon delivery of the product to its customers.&#160; The Company
          considers control to have transferred upon delivery because the customer has legal title to the asset, physical possession of the asset has been transferred, the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and the Company
          has present right to payment at that time.&#160; At the time of sale, estimates for several revenue deductions are recorded<font style="font-style: italic;">. </font>When estimating the impact of these revenue deductions from gross sales for a
          reporting period, knowledge of historical trends and judgmental estimates are required for each deduction. For sales of Sympazan, returns allowances and prompt pay discounts are estimated based on historical return rates if available, as well as
          on contractual terms, and these estimates are recorded as a reduction of receivables. Estimates affecting accrued liabilities include those related to wholesaler service fees, co-pay card redemption costs and Medicare, Medicaid and other rebates
          and are similarly based on historical results and contract terms.</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Total reductions of proprietary product sales in 2019 were $1,377, of which $203 affected Accounts receivable and $1,174 affected Accrued expenses as of December 31, 2019. Total reductions of
          proprietary product sales in 2018 were $591, of which $104 affected Accounts receivable and $481 affected Accrued expenses as of December 31, 2018.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">With respect to manufacturing and supply revenue stream, a quantity is ordered and manufactured according to the customer&#8217;s specifications and represents a single performance obligation.&#160; The products
          manufactured are exclusively for specific customers and have no alternative use.&#160; Under the customer arrangements, the Company is entitled to receive payments for progress made to date once the acceptance requirements surrounding quality control
          are satisfied.&#160; Thus, revenues related to this product stream are recognized at a point in time when the manufactured product passes quality control testing.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Royalty revenues are estimated based on the provisions of contracts with customers and recognized in the same period that the royalty-based products are sold to the Company&#8217;s strategic licensees, as
          all royalties are directly attributable to the Company&#8217;s manufacturing activities, and are therefore recognizable at the same time the manufacturing revenue is recognizable.&#160; In addition to usage-based royalties, licensing contracts may contain
          provisions for one-time payments related to certain license fees and milestone achievements.&#160; Revenue recognition of these license fees and milestone payments depend on the nature of the specific contract, typically license and milestone payments
          are recognized at a point in time in the period they are achieved.&#160; However, there are limited instances where, upon review of the contract, it determined that the license is non-distinct and limited in nature and does not provide benefit to the
          customer without purchasing the product, the upfront licensing fees are recognized over time (typically length of the contract).</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Co-development and research fee revenue is recorded over time based upon the progress of services provided in order to complete the specific performance obligation identified in the related contract.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Revenues from the sale of products and services and the subsequent related payments are evidenced by a contract with the customer, which includes all relevant terms of sale.&#160; For manufacturing and
          supply and proprietary product sales, invoices are generally issued upon the transfer of control and co-development and research revenue is typically invoiced based on the contractual payment schedule, or upon completion of the service.&#160; Invoices
          are typically payable 30 to 60 days after the invoice date, however some payment terms may reach 105 days depending on the customer.&#160; The Company performs a review of each specific customer&#8217;s credit worthiness and ability to pay prior to
          acceptance as a customer. Further, the Company performs periodic reviews of its customers&#8217; creditworthiness, prospectively.</div>
        <div><br>

        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Contract Assets</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In limited situations, certain customer contractual payment terms require billing to occur in arrears; accordingly, some portions, or all, of the Company&#8217;s performance obligations are completed before
          we are contractually entitled to bill the customer.&#160; In these situations, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, which results in a contract asset.&#160; These contract assets are reflected as a component of Trade and other receivables, net
          on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Contract Liabilities</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In other limited situations, certain customer contractual payment terms allow advanced billings; accordingly, customer cash payments may be received before satisfaction of some or all contractual
          performance obligations.&#160; In these situations, billing occurs in advance of revenue recognition, which results in contractual obligations.&#160; These contract liabilities are reflected as Deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.&#160; As
          remaining performance obligations are satisfied, a portion of the deferred revenue balance is recognized in the Company&#8217;s result of operations.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Warrants issued in conjunction with the Senior Secured Notes expire on June 30, 2025 and entitle the holders thereof to purchase two million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at $4.25 and
          include specified registration rights.&#160; Management estimated the fair value of these Warrants to be approximately $6,800, assisted by an independent third-party appraiser.&#160; The fair value of these Warrants is treated as a debt discount,
          amortizable over the term of the Warrants, with the unamortized loan portion applied to reduce the face amount of the loan in the Company&#8217;s balance sheet.&#160; Additionally, since the Warrants issued do not provide warrant redemption or put rights
          within the control of the holders that could require the Company to make a payment of cash or other assets to satisfy the obligations under the Warrants, except in the case of a &#8220;cash change in control&#8221;, the fair value attributed to these
          Warrants was presented in additional-paid in capital in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We classified the Perceptive Warrants as a liability on our balance sheets up to the effective date of our IPO, July 24, 2018, as they were free-standing financial instruments with the potential to
          require us to transfer assets upon exercise. The Perceptive Warrants were initially recorded at fair value on date of grant and were subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date. We utilized a third-party professional
          appraisal firm to assist in determining fair value of the Perceptive Warrant due to the absence of available Level 1 and 2 inputs prior to the IPO date.&#160; The fair value for period prior to the IPO date was based on unobservable Level 3 inputs.&#160;
          Changes in fair value of the Perceptive Warrants were reported in Other expense in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss through the effective date of our IPO, July 24, 2018.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The terms of the Perceptive Warrants conveyed the right to purchase 863,400 shares of our common stock, and this right was automatically exercised at the time of the IPO through issuance of common
          shares at a total price of $116.&#160; As a result, the warrant liability was classified to additional paid in capital during the third quarter of 2018.&#160; A Level 1 market pricing of $15.00, the initial price at which the Company&#8217;s common stock was
          offered, was used in determining fair value of the warrants as of the effective exercise date.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Income taxes are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 <font style="font-style: italic;">Income Taxes</font>, or ASC 740, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability
          approach. Income taxes have been calculated on a separate tax return basis. Certain of our activities and costs have been included in the tax returns filed by our predecessor company, MonoSol Rx, LLC. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
          recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
          differences are expected to affect taxable income. Tax benefits are recognized when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained during an audit. Valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence
          it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provision of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, we recognize the tax benefit of tax provisions to the extent that the benefit of
          tax positions will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position, as well as consideration of the available facts and
          circumstances. To date, we have not had any significant uncertain tax positions.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We provide certain employees, non-employee directors and consultants with performance incentives under our share-based compensation plans.&#160; Under these plans, we may grant restricted stock units and
          stock options in order to align long-term financial interest of selected participants with those of our stockholders, strengthen the commitment of such persons to the Company, and attract and retain competent and dedicated persons whose efforts
          will enhance long-term growth, profitability and share value.&#160; Compensation cost relating to share-based payments transactions is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December
          31, 2019, at their fair values at their grant dates. All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards.&#160;
          We determine the fair value of option awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that incorporates certain assumptions, such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the
          options.&#160; Restricted stock units are valued based upon the value of the Company&#8217;s underlying common stock.&#160; See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.&#160; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional
          discussion.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Prior to the Company&#8217;s conversion from an LLC to a C corporation, share-based compensation had been issued pursuant to two Performance Unit Plans, both of which were within the scope of FASB ASC
          Subtopic 718-30, <font style="font-style: italic;">Compensation &#8211; Stock Compensation &#8211; Awards Classified as Liabilities. </font>The fair value of this compensation was measurable by the increase in fair value at the time of settlement over the
          fair value determined at the grant date. Because the Company was privately owned during this time and had no public market for its LLC membership interests, significant judgements and estimates were necessarily inherent in the determination of
          fair values at various grant dates. Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors relied on various inputs to assist in their assessment of fair value, including relevant third-party investments, use of an enterprise value approach or use of an
          independent third-party valuation. Pursuant to the Performance Unit Plans, vested grants were not exercisable prior to either a change in control of the Company or completion of an IPO. These performance conditions rendered the grants contingent
          and, accordingly, expense recognition was deferred until either of the conditions were satisfied. On April 16, 2018, these Performance Unit Plans were formally terminated through actions of both the Board of Directors and the required approvals
          of certain plan participants. As a result, vesting of unvested performance units was accelerated and the Company issued non-voting common shares to compensate the performance unit holders. Immediately prior to the consummation of the IPO, all of
          the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares of non-voting common stock that had been issued in April 2018 were automatically converted to 4,922,353 shares of the voting common stock of Aquestive.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In accordance with ASC 718, <font style="font-style: italic;">Compensation &#8212; Stock Compensation,</font> the Company recorded a total charge to earnings representing the cost of this compensation
          totaling $27,298, consisting of $19,123 which relates to the estimated fair market value at the issuance date of the 4,922,353 non-voting common shares and $8,175 related to withholding taxes which the Company committed to pay on behalf of the
          performance unit holders.&#160; This compensation expense was estimated using an independent third-party valuation prepared in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aide, Valuation of Privately-Held Company
          Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. This valuation assumed a discount for lack of marketability of 34%, taking into consideration the illiquid nature of the security as well as other qualitative characteristics that would make it less
          marketable than the more senior securities. Volatility was assumed at 90%, based on that of comparable public companies.&#160; The weighted average cost of capital of 27.5% was also based on that of comparable public companies as well as market
          interest rate data. If we had made different assumptions in determinations of fair value at either the grant dates or at the time of issuance of the non-voting common shares issued in settlement of those grants, our equity-based compensation
          expense, net loss and net loss per share of common stock could have been significantly different.</div>

        <div style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">JOBS Act</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act, was enacted. The JOBS Act provides that, among other things, an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended
          transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As an emerging growth company, we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised
          accounting standards and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public emerging growth companies.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition, we intend to rely on the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if as an &#8220;emerging growth
          company&#8221; we intend to rely on such exemptions, we are not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor&#8217;s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
          of 2002, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and (iii) disclose certain executive compensation-related
          items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer&#8217;s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the
          consummation of our IPO or until we no longer meet the requirements of being an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We are also a &#8220;smaller reporting company,&#8221; meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a &#8220;smaller reporting
          company,&#8221; and have either: (i) a public float of less than $250 million or (ii) annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and (A) no public float or (B) a public float of less than $700 million. As a
          &#8220;smaller reporting company,&#8221; we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations in our SEC filings compared to other issuers, including with respect to disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy
          statements and certain reduced financial disclosures in our periodic reports including this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">&#160;Prior to July 15, 2019, our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates related primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense from fluctuations in one-month
          LIBOR associated with our debt facility. For each 1% increase in one-month LIBOR in excess of the floor of 2%, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $500,000. However, our Senior Secured Notes due 2025 issued on July 15,
          2019 carry a 12.5% fixed interest rate per annum, thereby eliminating market risk due to changes in interest rates.&#160; Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in FDIC protected accounts with no exposure to material changes in interest rates.&#160;
          At December 31, 2019, our interest rate on deposited cash was 1.55%.&#160; We do not purchase, sell or hold derivatives or other market risk sensitive instruments to hedge interest rate risk or for trading purposes.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Our accounts receivables are concentrated predominantly with Indivior.&#160; With the recent launch of Sympazan, our concentration with three large regional wholesalers of pharmaceutical products is not
          significant presently but may become so in future periods should Sympazan sales increase and should other pipeline products become approved by the FDA and become distributed through these three regional, or other, wholesalers. In the event of
          non-performance or non-payment by either Indivior or the wholesalers, there may be a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or net cash flow.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">We maintain disclosure controls that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
          &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal

          procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
          objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.&#160; Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded based upon the evaluation

            control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
            accounting principles.&#160; Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
            dispositions of the assets of Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc,; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,

          <div style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December&#160;31, 2018 and 2019, the related consolidated statements
            of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders&#8217; deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two&#8209;year period ended December&#160;31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our
            opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December&#160;31, 2018 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
            two&#8209;year period ended December&#160;31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.</div>

          <div style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers as of January 1, 2019 due to the
            adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, <font style="font-style: italic;">Revenue from Contracts with Customers</font>.</div>

          <div style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
            audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the <font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)</font> and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
            accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</div>
          <div style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</div>
          <div style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
            financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are
            required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
            opinion.</div>
          <div style="font-weight: normal;">&#160;</div>
          <div style="text-align: left; font-weight: normal;">Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
            respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
            significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</div>

          and solve critical healthcare challenges, having been formed effective on January 1, 2018 via the conversion of MonoSol Rx, LLC to a Delaware corporation, and a simultaneous name change. The Company has a commercial proprietary product and a
          late-stage proprietary product pipeline focused on the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system, or CNS, and is developing orally administered complex molecules as alternatives to more invasive therapies. Aquestive is pursuing its
          business objectives through commercialization of its own products and through in-licensing and out-licensing arrangements. Production facilities are located in Portage, Indiana, and corporate headquarters, sales and commercialization operations
          and primary research laboratory facilities are based in Warren, New Jersey. The Company&#8217;s major customer and primary commercialization licensee has global operations headquartered in the United Kingdom with principal operations in the United

          approximately $57,543 after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering related transaction costs of approximately $9,957. The underwriters&#8217; over-allotment option was exercised in August 2018 and the Company issued 425,727
          additional common shares at $15.00 per share in exchange for additional net proceeds of approximately $5,939, after deducting underwriter discounts of approximately $447.&#160; The sale of these common shares provided total net proceeds of $63,482.
          Immediately prior to the consummation of the IPO, all of the Company&#8217;s outstanding shares of non-voting common stock was automatically converted to 4,922,353 shares of voting common stock to settle all obligations to performance unit plan
          participants.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of
          contingent assets and contingent liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions often involve assessments of matters that are
          inherently uncertain and accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates.&#160; <font style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory
            costs, allowances for rebates from proprietary product sales, allowances for sales returns, the useful lives of fixed assets, the valuations of warrants issued and of share-based compensation, and contingencies.</font></div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2019 and 2018,
          cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash in bank accounts and money market funds.</div>

        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(C) Concentration of Credit Risk</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Cash and cash equivalents are maintained at one federally insured financial institution. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes that the Company is not
          exposed to any credit risk due to the financial position of the banking institution.&#160; Indivior is our largest customer, and these details on this relationship are outlined in Note 5.&#160; Indivior does not represent a material credit risk.</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify; color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(D) Trade Accounts Receivable</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business, but generally does not require
          collateral or any other security to support its receivables. The Company&#8217;s credit terms generally range from 30 to 90 days, depending on the customer and type of invoice.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. Neither receivables nor revenues are recorded unless collection is reasonably assured. In situations
          where changing circumstances indicate that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a provision to the allowances for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due in order to reduce the net recognized
          receivable to the amount that is reasonably expected to be collected. For all other customers, a provision to the allowances for doubtful accounts is recorded based on factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the current
          business environment and the Company&#8217;s historical experience. Provisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is
          probable that the receivable will not be recovered. The allowance for doubtful accounts, associated with recoverability of accounts receivable, was $124 and $58 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Inventories, consisting of purchased materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, are stated at the lower of cost, determined by the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value, in
          accordance with ASU 2015-11, <font style="font-style: italic;">Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory</font>. The Company regularly reviews its inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates inventories for excess quantities, obsolescence and shelf life expiration. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product,
          projections of future demand, the risk of competitive obsolescence for products, general market conditions, and a review of the shelf life expiration dates for products. To the extent that management determines there are excess or obsolete
          inventory or quantities with a shelf life that is too near its expiration for the Company to reasonably expect that it can sell those products, or use them in production, prior to their expiration, the Company records allowances to adjust the
          carrying value to estimated net realizable value as necessary.</div>
        <div><br>

        <div style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">
          <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Property and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, which is computed by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the respective
            assets, as discussed below. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the leased assets. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred, and expenditures for major
            renewals and improvements are capitalized. Upon disposition of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected in the accompanying
            Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company assesses the net book value of its property and equipment for impairment at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be
            recoverable in the ordinary course of its business.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Intangible assets include the costs of acquired composition and process technologies and the costs of purchased patents used in the manufacture of orally soluble film. The Company amortizes these
          assets using the straight-line method over the shorter of their legal lives or estimated useful lives.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(H) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Long lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
          In these circumstances, the Company compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to the corresponding carrying amounts. If this comparison is indicative of impairment, an impairment charge is recognized
          to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered most
          appropriate.</div>
        <div><br>

        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(I) Revenue from Contracts with Customers</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Company&#8217;s revenues include (i) sales of manufactured products pursuant to contracts with commercialization partners, (ii) sales of its proprietary clobazam-based Sympazan oral film product used as
          a treatment for LGS-related seizures, (iii) license and royalty revenues and (iv) co-development and research fees generally in the form of milestone payments. See Note 5 for further details. Having adopted ASC 606, <font style="font-style: italic;">Revenue from Contracts with Customers,</font> effective on January 1, 2019 and applying the modified retrospective method which resulted in an adjustment totaling $2,832 to the Company&#8217;s accumulated deficit, the Company recognizes
          revenue to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, a
          five-step model is applied that includes (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligation in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance
          obligations, and (5) recognizing when, or as, an entity satisfies a performance obligation.&#160; Revenues recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 were reflected based on the prior standards specified in ASC 605, <font style="font-style: italic;">Revenue Recognition</font>, which provided that revenue is recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the price is fixed or determinable and (4)
          collectability is reasonably assured.</div>

        <div style="color: #000000; text-indent: 36pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Manufacture and Supply Revenue</font> &#8211; Beginning on January 1, 2019 with the adoption of ASC 606, the Company records revenues from products manufactured under
          contract with commercialization partners when manufacturing processes are complete and internal quality standards have been met. Shipment of these products typically occurs within days of completion of the Company&#8217;s quality assessments. Prior to
          that date, revenue was recorded under standards established by ASC 605, generally resulting in revenue recognition upon shipment and transfer of title for manufactured products.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; text-indent: 36pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Proprietary Product sales -</font> Revenues from proprietary product sales are recorded when product is shipped and title passes to the customer, typically at time of
          delivery. At the time of sale, estimates for various revenue allowances are recorded based on historical trends and judgmental estimates<font style="font-style: italic;">. </font>For sales of Sympazan, returns allowances and prompt pay discounts
          are estimated based on contract terms and historical return rates, if available, and these estimates are recorded as a reduction of receivables. Similarly determined estimates are recorded relating to wholesaler service fees, co-pay card
          redemption costs, Medicare, Medicaid and other rebates, and these estimates are reflected as a component of accrued liabilities.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; text-indent: 36pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">License and Royalty Revenue</font> &#8211; Effective upon adoption of ASC 606, license revenues are determined based on an assessment of whether the license is distinct
          from any other performance obligations that may be included in the underlying licensing arrangement. If the customer is able to benefit from the license without provision of any other performance obligations by the Company and the license is
          thereby viewed as a distinct or functional license, the Company then determines whether the customer has acquired a right to use the license or a right to access the license. For functional licenses that do not require further development or
          other ongoing activities by the Company, the customer is viewed as acquiring the right to use the license as, and when, transferred and revenues are generally recorded at a point in time, subject to contingencies or constraints. For symbolic
          licenses providing substantial value only in conjunction with other performance obligations to be provided by the Company, revenues are generally recorded over the term of the license agreement. Such other obligations provided by the Company
          generally include manufactured products, additional development services or other deliverables that are contracted to be provided during the license term. Payments received in excess of amounts ratably or otherwise earned are deferred and
          recognized over the term of the license or as contingencies or other performance obligations are met.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; text-indent: 36pt;">Royalty revenue under ASC 606 is estimated and recognized when sales under supply agreements with commercial partners are recorded, absent any contractual constraints or collectability uncertainties.
          Royalties based on sales of Suboxone and Zuplenz in 2019 are recorded in this manner. Royalties recorded in 2018 under ASC 605 were based on reported sales data and collectability assessments.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; text-indent: 36pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Co-development and Research Fees</font> &#8211;Co-development and research fees are earned through performance of specific tasks, activities or completion of stages of
          development defined within a contractual development or feasibility study agreement with a customer. The nature of these performance obligations, broadly referred to as milestones or deliverables, are usually dependent on the scope and structure
          of the project as contracted, as well as the complexity of the product and the specific regulatory approval path necessary for that product. Accordingly, the duration of the Company&#8217;s research and development projects may range from several
          months to approximately three years. Although each contractual arrangement is unique, common milestones included in these arrangements include those for the performance of efficacy and other tests, reports of findings, formulation of initial
          prototypes, production of stability clinical and/or scale-up batches, and stability testing of those batches. Additional milestones may be established and linked to clinical results of the product submission and/or approval of the product by the
          FDA and the commercial launch of the product.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Revenue recognition arising from milestone payments is dependent upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the milestone payments. Milestone payments based on a non-sales metric such as a
          development-based milestone (e.g., an NDA filing or obtaining regulatory approval) represent variable consideration and are included in the transaction price subject to any constraints. If the milestone payments relate to future development, the
          timing of recognition depends upon historical experience and the significance a third party has on the outcome. For milestone payments to be received upon the achievement of a sales threshold, the revenue from the milestone payments is recognized
          at the later of when the actual sales are incurred or the performance obligation to which the sales relate to has been satisfied.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Company also operates under a certain collaborative arrangement under which the parties share revenues and expenses related to development, manufacturing and commercialization of a product. This
          contractual arrangement falls within the scope of FASB ASC Subtopic 808-10, <font style="font-style: italic;">Collaborative Arrangements</font>, and revenues and expenses are recorded based on the guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-45, <font style="font-style: italic;">Revenue Recognition &#8211; Principal Agent Considerations</font>. Revenue earned and expenses incurred under this agreement as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was not material.</div>

        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(J) Research and Development</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Costs incurred in connection with research and development activities are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include (i) employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits,
          travel and share-based compensation expense, (ii) external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research and contract manufacturing organizations, investigational sites and
          consultants, (iii) the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical study materials, and (iv) costs associated with preclinical and clinical activities and regulatory operations. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services
          that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity is performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when payment is made, in accordance with ASC 730, <font style="font-style: italic;">Research






















            and Development.</font></div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Income taxes are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes, or ASC 740, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Income taxes have been calculated on
          a separate tax return basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
          tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Tax benefits are recognized when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained during an audit. Valuation
          allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with the provision of ASC 740. When uncertain tax positions exist, the tax benefit is recognized to the extent that the benefit will more likely
          than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position, as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. To date, the
          Company has not had any significant uncertain tax positions.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Company records share-based compensation expenses for awards of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) under ASC 718, <font style="font-style: italic;">Compensation &#8212; Stock Compensation</font>.
          For awards to non-employees for periods prior to the adoption of ASU 2018-07, <font style="font-style: italic;">Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Non-employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,</font> on January 1, 2019, the Company
          had applied ASC 505-50, <font style="font-style: italic;">Equity-based Payments to Non-Employees</font>. ASC 718 establishes guidance for the recognition of expenses arising from the issuance of stock-based compensation awards at their fair
          value at the grant date.</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Company&#8217;s stock-based compensation includes grants of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees, consultants and non-employee directors. During 2019, the Company also offered
          employees an opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan. Expenses arising from these grants are recorded in the accompanying financial statements based on their grant date fair values as ratably earned during their respective
          vesting periods. The Company&#8217;s estimates of the fair value of options at their grant dates is based on the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model and considers various variables and assumptions, including:</div>

          unvested RSUs and the purchase of shares from the Company&#8217;s employee stock purchase plan (using the treasury stock method). For all periods presented, potential common shares have been excluded from the calculation of EPS because their effect

          price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable
          inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered
          observable and the last is considered unobservable:</div>

        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09, <font style="font-style: italic;">Revenue from Contracts with Customers</font>,
          and subsequently issued a number of amendments to this update. The new standard, as amended in Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, provides a single comprehensive model to be used in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with
          customers and supersedes previously applicable revenue recognition guidance provided by ASC 605. The new standard&#8217;s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
          in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
          arising from contracts with customers. See also Note 3/(I) above.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $2,832 to its accumulated deficit upon adoption. This
          adjustment related to the deferral of $3,100 of previously recognized license revenue net of the acceleration of $268 of co-development fees and royalties. Under the modified retrospective method of adoption, the comparative information in the
          consolidated financial statements has not been revised and continues to be reported under ASC 605. The Company is generally recognizing existing manufacture and supply revenue, co-development milestones and fees and royalty revenue earlier than
          it would have under the previous standard.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In January 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance governing accounting and reporting of financial instruments (ASU 2016-01) and in 2018 issued technical corrections (ASU 2018-03). This guidance
          requires that equity investments with readily determinable fair values that are classified as available-for-sale be measured at fair value with changes in value reflected in current earnings. This guidance also simplifies the impairment testing
          of equity investments without readily determinable fair values and alters certain disclosure requirements. ASU No. 2016-01,<font style="font-style: italic;"> Financial Instruments &#8211; Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
            Financial Liabilities</font>, also provides guidance as to classification of the change in fair value of financial liabilities. These revised standards were effective for the Company on January 1, 2019.&#160; Adoption of this standard did not have a
          material impact on the financial statements.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, <font style="font-style: italic;">Compensation&#8212;Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting</font>, which
          aligns accounting for share-based payments issued to nonemployees to that of employees under the existing guidance of Topic 718, with certain exceptions. This update supersedes previous guidance for equity-based payments to nonemployees under <font style="font-style: italic;">Subtopic 505-50, Equity&#8212;Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees.</font> The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method and charged a cumulative effect adjustment of $20 to
          its accumulated deficit upon adoption.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="color: #000000; font-style: italic;">Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Adopted as of December 31, 2019:</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,<font style="font-style: italic;"> Leases (Topic 842)</font> which establishes a comprehensive new lease accounting model. The
          new standard: (i) clarifies the definition of a lease; (ii) requires a dual approach to lease classification similar to current lease classifications; and (iii) causes lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability with a
          corresponding right-of-use (ROU) asset for leases with a lease-term of more than twelve months. The new standard is effective for the Company for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and requires modified
          retrospective application. The standard is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020. Accordingly, the Company will reflect its ROU assets, lease liabilities and any cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in its consolidated
          financial statements beginning on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the lease liability will be equal to the present value of future lease payments and a right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment for items such
          as initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the new standard retains a dual model similar to ASC 840, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or financing. Operating leases will continue to result in straight-line
          expense while financing leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current accounting guidance by lessees for operating and capital leases, respectively, under ASC 840).</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">There are a number of practical expedients available to the Company at transition. The transitional practical expedients provide that the Company may elect to not re-assess: (i)
          whether its contracts contain a lease under the new definition, (ii) the classification of those leases and (iii) the accounting for any initial direct costs previously incurred. The Company may also elect to not recognize a ROU asset and lease
          liability for those leases with a remaining lease term of 12 months or less. The Company will apply these practical expedients upon adoption.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Upon adoption, ROU assets and lease liabilities will be recognized on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets. The lease liability recognized upon adoption is based upon the
          present value of the sum of the remaining minimum lease payments (as previously identified under ASC 840) and any amounts probable of being owed under a residual value guarantee (if applicable), to be determined using an appropriate discount
          rate, based on the Company&#8217;s ability to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar remaining term and in a similar economic environment. The ROU asset to be recorded is based on the lease liability and adjusted for any prepaid or accrued
          lease payments, the remaining balance of any lease incentives, initial indirect costs and impairments (if applicable).</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The recognition of lease liabilities and corresponding ROU assets is expected to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. The Company estimates that it
          will record approximately $4,000 of lease liabilities and ROU assets, respectively, as of January 1, 2020, the difference representing previously recorded lease-related assets and liabilities. The Company does not believe the adoption of this
          standard will have a material impact on its consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#8217; equity or cash flows. Refer to Note 18, <font style="font-style: italic;">Commitments and Contingencies</font>, for further information on the
          Company&#8217;s existing leases.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,<font style="font-style: italic;"> Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses (Topic 326)</font>, amending existing guidance on the accounting for credit
          losses on financial instruments within its scope. The guidance introduces an expected loss model for estimating credit losses, replacing the incurred loss model. The new guidance also changes the impairment model for available-for-sale debt
          securities, requiring the use of an allowance to record estimated credit losses (and subsequent recoveries). The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
          adoption on its consolidated financial statements.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,<font style="font-style: italic;"> Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, </font>providing
          guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows intended to reduce diversity in practice, including cash flows related to debt prepayment or extinguishment costs and contingent consideration
          that may be paid following a business combination. The guidance is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect a material effect of the standard on its
          Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt;"><font style="color: #000000;">In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, </font><font style="font-style: italic; color: #000000;">Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework. </font><font style="color: #000000;">The purpose of the update is to improve the effectiveness of the fair value measurement disclosures that allows for clear communication of information that is most important to the users of financial statements. There
            were certain required disclosures that have been removed or modified. In addition, the update added the following disclosures: (i) changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income (loss) for recurring
            Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and (ii) the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The standard will become effective for the
            Company for its periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted. The Company</font> does not expect a material effect of the standard on its consolidated financial statements.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, <font style="font-style: italic;">Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40: Customer&#8217;s Accounting for Implementation Costs
            Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract</font>, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing
          implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The update provides guidance distinguishing between capitalizable service contract implementation costs and contract costs required to be expense. In addition, the update
          requires that the term of the hosting arrangement is to include the non-cancelable period of the arrangement plus periods covered by (i) an option to extend the arrangement if the customer is reasonably certain to exercise that option; (ii) an
          option to terminate the arrangement if the customer is reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option and (iii) an option to extend (or not to terminate) the arrangement in which exercise of the option is in the control of the vendor.
          This standard will become effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2021. The amendments may be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company is currently
          evaluating the impact of ASU 2018-15 on its consolidated financial statements.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, <font style="font-style: italic;">Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, </font>which amends accounting for income
          taxes during interim periods and makes changes to certain income tax classifications. The new standard allows exceptions to the use of the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation, when there is a loss from continuing operations and
          income or a gain from other items, and to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The standard also requires franchise or similar taxes
          partially based on income to be reported as income tax and the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates to be included in the annual effective tax rate computation from the date of enactment. The standard will be effective for the Company
          beginning January 1, 2022, with early adoption of the amendments permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact from the adoption of ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements.</div>

            and expenses. In December 2019, a portion of the warrants issued to the holders of this new debt were exercised, providing additional funding of $1,821. Also, in December 2019, the Company closed a public offering of 8,050,000 common shares

            monetization of its out-licensed apomorphine product candidate, subject to regulatory approval which cannot be assured, and access to the capital markets under its shelf registration statement, will be adequate to meet its expected operating,
            investing, and financing needs for&#160; the next twelve months. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet liquidity needs as the Company continues to execute its business strategy, the Company anticipates that additional funding
            requirements will be obtained through monetization of certain royalty streams or through additional debt or equity financings, and continuing expense reduction initiatives, or a combination of these potential sources of funds, although the
            Company can provide no assurance that these sources of funding will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.&#160; We have based this expectation on assumptions that could change or prove to be inaccurate and, additionally, we could utilize our

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In August 2008, the Company entered into a Commercial Exploitation Agreement with Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#8220;Indivior License Agreement&#8221;). Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
          was later succeeded to in interest by Indivior, Inc.&#160; Pursuant to the Indivior License Agreement, the Company agreed to manufacture and supply Indivior&#8217;s requirements for Suboxone, a sublingual film formulation, for markets both inside and
          outside the United States on an exclusive basis.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">
          <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Under the terms of the Indivior License Agreement, the Company is required to manufacture Suboxone in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice standards and according to the
            specifications and processes set forth in the related quality agreements the Company entered into with Indivior. Additionally, the Company is required to obtain Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients&#160; for the manufacture of Suboxone directly from
            Indivior. The Indivior License Agreement specifies a minimum annual threshold quantity of Suboxone that the Company is obligated to fill and requires Indivior to provide the Company with a forecast of its requirements at various specified times
            throughout the year.</div>
        </div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Indivior License Agreement provides for payment by Indivior of a purchase price per unit that is subject to adjustment based on the Company&#8217;s ability to satisfy minimum product thresholds.
          Additionally, in the event Indivior purchases certain large quantities of Suboxone during a specified period, Indivior will be entitled to scaled rebates on its purchases.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In addition to the purchase price for the Suboxone supplied, Indivior is required to make certain single digit percentage royalty payments tied to net sales value (as provided for in the Indivior
          License Agreement) in each of the United States and in the rest of the world subject to annual maximum amounts and limited to the life of the related United States or international patents. Indivior exercised its right to buy out its future
          royalty obligations in the United States under this agreement in 2012. Indivior remains obligated to pay royalties for all sales outside the United States.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The Indivior License Agreement contains customary contractual termination provisions, including a filing for bankruptcy or corporate dissolution, an invalidation of the intellectual property
          surrounding Suboxone, or commission of a material breach of the Indivior License Agreement by either party. Additionally, Indivior may terminate the Indivior License Agreement if the FDA or other applicable regulatory authority declares the
          Company&#8217;s manufacturing site to no longer be suitable for the manufacture of Suboxone or Suboxone is no longer suitable to be manufactured due to health or safety reasons. The initial term of the Indivior License Agreement was seven years from
          the commencement date. Thereafter, the Indivior License Agreement automatically renews for successive one-year periods, unless Indivior provides the Company with written notice of its intent not to renew at least one year prior to the expiration
          of the initial or renewal term.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">On September 24, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Indivior, or the Indivior Supplemental Agreement. Pursuant to the Indivior Supplemental Agreement, the Company conveyed to Indivior
          all existing and future rights in the settlement of various ongoing patent enforcement legal actions and disputes related to the Suboxone product. The Company also conveyed to Indivior the right to sublicense manufacturing and marketing
          capabilities to allow an Indivior licensed generic buprenorphine product to be produced and sold by parties unrelated to Indivior or Aquestive. Under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement, the Company is entitled to receive certain payments from
          Indivior commencing on the date of the agreement through January 1, 2023. Once paid, all payments made under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement are non-refundable. Through February 20, 2019, the date of launch of the competing generics of Dr.
          Reddy&#8217;s Labs and Alvogen, the Company received an aggregate of $40,750 from Indivior under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement. Further payments under this agreement were suspended until adjudication of related patent infringement litigation is
          finalized. If such litigation is successful, in addition to the amounts already received as described in the foregoing, the Company may receive up to an additional $34,250, consisting of (i) up to $33,000 in the aggregate from any combination of
          (a) performance or event-based milestone payments and (b) single digit percentage royalties on net revenue earned by Indivior on sales of Suboxone and (ii) an additional $1,250 that was earned through the issuance of additional process patent
          rights to the Company. The aggregate payments under this Indivior Supplemental Agreement are capped at $75,000.</div>

        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">All payments made by Indivior to the Company pursuant to the Indivior Supplemental Agreement are in addition to, and not in place of, any amounts owed by Indivior to the Company pursuant to the
          Indivior License Agreement. Indivior&#8217;s payment obligations under the Indivior Supplemental Agreement are subject to certain factors affecting the market for Suboxone and may terminate prior to January 1, 2023 in the event certain contingencies

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In April 2016, the Company entered into a license agreement with Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. (which was later succeeded to in interest by Sunovion), referred to as the Sunovion License Agreement,
          pursuant to which the Company granted Sunovion an exclusive, worldwide license (with the right to sub-license) to certain intellectual property, including existing and future patents and patent applications, covering all oral films containing
          APL-130277 (apomorphine) for the treatment of off episodes in Parkinson&#8217;s disease patients, as well as two other fields. The Company&#8217;s licensee, Sunovion, as sponsor of APL-130277, submitted an NDA to the FDA on March 29, 2018; on the PDUFA date
          in January 2019, Sunovion received a CRL. In the 2019 fourth quarter, Sunovion announced that it had received a PDUFA date of May 21, 2020 after the submission of&#160; its NDA.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In consideration of the rights granted to Sunovion under the Sunovion License Agreement, the Company received aggregate payments totaling $18,000 to date. In addition to the upfront payment of $5,000,
          the Company has also earned an aggregate of $13,000 in connection with specified regulatory and development milestones in the United States and Europe (the &#8220;Initial Milestone Payments&#8221;), all of which of which has been received to date. The
          Company is also entitled to receive certain contingent one-time milestone payments related to product availability and regulatory approval in the United States and Europe, certain one-time milestone payments based on the achievement of specific
          annual net sales thresholds of APL-130277, and ongoing mid-single digit percentage royalty payments related to the net sales of APL-130277 (subject to reduction to low-single digit percentage royalty payments in certain circumstances), subject to
          certain minimum payments. The maximum aggregate milestone payments that may be paid to the Company pursuant to the Sunovion License Agreement is equal to $45,000. With the exception of the Initial Milestone Payments, there can be no guarantee
          that any such milestones will in fact be met or payable.</div>
        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">This Sunovion License Agreement will continue until terminated by the Company or Sunovion in accordance with the termination provisions of the Sunovion License Agreement. Absent early termination, the
          Sunovion License Agreement continues (on a country-by-country basis) until the expiration of all applicable licensed patents. Upon termination, all rights to intellectual property granted to Sunovion to develop and commercialize products will
          revert to the Company and Sunovion must continue to pay royalties to the Company on each sale of their remaining inventory of products commercialized by Sunovion which include apomorphine as their API.</div>

        <div><br>
        </div>
        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">In March 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with KemPharm, Inc. (&#8220;KemPharm&#8221;), to terminate a Collaboration and License Agreement entered into in April 2011. Under this termination
          arrangement, the Company has the right to participate in any and all value that KemPharm may derive from the commercialization or any other monetization of KP-415 and KP-484 compounds or their derivatives. Among these monetization transactions
          are those related to any business combinations involving KemPharm and collaborations, royalty arrangements, or other transactions from which KemPharm may realize value from these compounds. During September 2019, the Company received $1.0 million
          from its 10% share of milestone payments paid to KemPharm, under its licensing of KP-415 and KP-484.&#160; There can be no guarantee that such payments will be made in the future.</div>

            &#8220;Notes&#8221;) and issued warrants for two million shares of common stock (the &#8220;Warrants&#8221;), $.001 per value per share, through its structuring agent, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., LLC, and entered into a purchase agreement and related indenture (the
            &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221; or &#8220;Indenture&#8221;) governing these Notes. The Company simultaneously entered into related agreements including a Collateral Agreement with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee and collateral agent, and a Lien
            Subordination and Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of Madryn Health Partners, other institutional noteholders and U.S. Bank National Association in dual roles providing terms governing an asset-based loan facility.</font></div>

          <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">Upon closing, the Company issued $70,000 of the principal of the Notes (the &#8220;Initial Notes&#8221;) along with the Warrants and rights of first offer (the &#8220;First Offer Rights&#8221;) to the lenders
            participating in this transaction for Notes and Warrants (the &#8220;Lenders&#8221;).&#160; Issuance of the Initial Notes and Warrants provided net proceeds of $66,082. In addition to the Initial Notes, the Indenture may provide access to further loans of up to
            $30,000 that may become available in two tranches of Additional Notes tied to the NDA filing for and FDA approval of Libervant, an important part of our drug candidate pipeline. Provided that no events of default exist, the Company may elect,
            in its discretion and subject to approval of the holder of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, to offer to the Lenders participation in a $10,000 additional offering of 12.5% senior secured notes (the &#8220;First Additional
            Offering&#8221;) under terms similar to the Initial Notes, on or before March 31, 2021, upon the filing of the Libervant NDA with the FDA. A second identical funding opportunity would allow the Company to obtain, on or before March 31, 2021, an
            additional $20,000 if the first option has been elected and funded, or, if not elected or funded, an additional $30,000 may be offered for issuance following FDA approval of Libervant for marketing in the U.S.&#160; There can be no assurance that

            that are senior to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company and provides Lenders with perfected security interests in substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets. In the event that asset-based loans of up to $10,000 (&#8220;ABL
            Facility&#8221;) may be obtained, subject receivables and inventory assets will provide a second priority lien to senior secured note holders. The Company&#8217;s license of its IP to a third-party drug development enterprise (specifically, Sunovion
            Pharmaceutical&#8217;s APL-130277 product) is one of the various assets serving as collateral for this loan. The loan indenture permits the Company to monetize this asset while specifying that a portion of the proceeds, up to $40,000 if the First
            Additional Offering has not been elected or funded, or, $50,000 if it has been elected and funded, must be applied to prepay the Initial Notes, at 112.5% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
            if any, thereon to the date of repurchase, to the extent elected by the Note holders, assuming that such monetization, up to such $40,000 or $50,000 level, as applicable, equals or exceeds those levels and if such monetization does not equal or
            exceed such level, such prepayment would be pro-rated among the Note holders. To the extent that Lenders do not elect repayment of the debt at the date of monetization, the amount not elected up to $40,000 (or $50,000 if an additional tranche
            is issued) will be held in a collateral account until approval of Libervant by the FDA, at which time this cash collateral is to be released to the Company.&#160; Proceeds in excess of $40,000 (or $50,000 if an additional tranche is issued) can be

          2018 earnings to reflect the increase in value of this warrant during that period in 2018. Also, as a result of the exercise of the warrant,&#160; Perceptive received 863,400 shares of common stock in exchange for proceeds from the July 2018 exercise
          of $116, concurrent with which the remaining warrant liability of $12,952 was reclassified to additional paid in capital during the third quarter of 2018.&#160; A Level 1 market price of $15.00, the initial price at which the Company&#8217;s common stock

            restricted stock unit awards (RSUs) and stock option grants and, for the year ended December 31, 2018, also included costs related to non-voting common shares as well. As further detailed below, non-voting common shares were issued in April
            2018 to compensate participants in the Company&#8217;s previously maintained Performance Unit Plans at the time that those incentive plans were terminated. RSUs and options were granted pursuant to the Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. 2018 Equity
            Incentive Plan, which was first adopted by the Board of Directors on June 15, 2018. The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors also adopted the Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan in June 2018 and the Company began rollout of the
            plan in late 2018. Initial employee purchases under terms of this plan were made in 2019.</div>

          determined based on that of comparable public companies, given the lack of any definitive history regarding its own publicly-traded common stock. The expected term of the award was calculated using the simplified method. A weighted average was
          utilized taking into account the two vesting periods to determine the expected term in years.&#160; The risk-free interest rates are derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for instruments with a remaining term
          similar to the expected life of the options.</div>

          of grant. These option grants provided a maximum contract term of 10 years from grant date, with a weighted average remaining contract life of 9.0 years. Options granted to senior management and Board members vest in equal quarterly or monthly
          increments over three years; options granted to key employees are subject to a three-year graduated vesting schedule. These stock options are not subject to performance-based criteria other than continued employment.</div>

        <div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">The purpose of the ESPP is to help retain and motivate current employees, to attract new talent, and to provide eligible employees of the Company a convenient manner of purchasing
          shares of common stock at a discounted price at periodic intervals by means of accumulated payroll deductions. The Company may offer common stock purchase rights biannually under offerings that allow for the purchase of common stock at the lower
          of 85% of the fair value of shares on either the first or last day of the offering period. The offerings may, or may not, also provide tax advantages. Purchases made via a tax-advantaged offering are intended to qualify as purchases made within
          the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Offerings may run concurrently, or serially, and each offering will be treated as separate and distinct. Under the ESPP, a total of 250,000 shares of common stock were initially reserved
          for issuance. During 2019, employees purchased 56,378 shares through this plan.</div>

          <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $85,905 and $41,385, respectively, a significant portion of which carryforward for an indefinite
            period. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company also had state net operating loss carryforwards of $80,266 and $39,217, respectively. These state net operating losses carry forwards begin expiring in 2039 and 2038, respectively. As a result
            of the December 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&#8220;TCJA&#8221;), updated regulations under section 163j create new limitations on deductible interest&#160;expense. The Company&#8217;s interest expense deduction under 163j will be limited for tax purposes based
            on a calculation of 30% of its EBITDA on a tax basis. The Company has determined, based upon available evidence, that is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized and accordingly, has provided a full valuation
            allowance against its net deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances of $40,057, and $19,509 have been established at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company may also be subject to the net operating loss utilization provisions of
            Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to ownership changes. As a result, the use of NOL carry forwards from the current and prior periods are subject to annual limitations.</div>

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">Entities are also required to evaluate, measure, recognize and disclose any uncertain income tax provisions taken on their income tax returns. The Company has analyzed its tax positions and has
          concluded that there were no uncertain positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and has not accrued any interest or penalties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company&#8217;s
          U.S. federal and state net operating losses have occurred since its election to treat as a C Corporation in 2017 and as such, tax years subject to potential tax examination could apply from that date because the utilization of net operating
          losses from prior years opens the relevant year to audit by the IRS and/or state taxing authorities.&#160;&#160; In early 2020, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service began an examination of the Company&#8217;s federal income tax return for 2018.&#160; The Company does
          not expect to recognize a significant amount of additional tax expense as a result of concluding this examination.</div>

          an entity does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA. That guidance specifies that, for income tax effects of the TCJA that
          can be reasonably estimated but for which the accounting and measurement analysis is not yet complete, entities should report provisional amounts in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and those provisional amounts can be
          adjusted for a measurement period not to exceed one year from the enactment date.</div>

        <div style="color: #000000; text-indent: 36pt;">On July 1, 2018, the New Jersey governor signed into law a bill which included significant changes to the New Jersey taxation of corporations. Chiefly, this legislation imposes a 2.5% surtax on
          taxpayers with allocated net income over $1 million for 2018 and 2019, and a 1.5% sur tax for taxpayers with allocated net income over $1 million for 2020 and 2021. In addition, the state is changing its filing requirements from separate entity
          reporting to combined reporting on a water&#8217;s edge basis. Further, there are changes to the state&#8217;s computation of its dividend received deduction and application of IRC section 163(j). The Company has considered these changes and does not believe
          this change in law will have a material impact due to availability of significant New Jersey NOL carryforwards to set off against future taxable income and a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets.</div>

            prevents Actavis from entering the market until 2024.&#160; The case(s) against the remaining defendants regarding the additional asserted patents have not been finally resolved.&#160; A <font style="font-style: italic;">Markman </font>hearing in the
            cases against Dr. Reddy&#8217;s and Alvogen was held on October 17, 2019.&#160; On November 5, 2019, the Court issued its <font style="font-style: italic;">Markman</font> opinion construing the disputed terms of the asserted patents. On January 9, 2020,
            the Court entered into a stipulated order of non-infringement of the &#8216;305 patent based on the Court&#8217;s claim construction ruling, and Aquestive and Indivior reserved our rights to appeal the claim construction ruling.&#160; On November 19, 2019, the
            magistrate judge issued an order granting DRL and Alvogen&#8217;s requests to file amended answers to add antitrust counterclaims. Aquestive and Indivior appealed the magistrate judge&#8217;s decision to the District Judge on December 4, 2019, DRL and
            Alvogen opposed the appeal. The parties are awaiting further action from the Court on the appeal.&#160; On January 17, 2020, a motion was filed to dismiss DRL&#8217;s and Alvogen&#8217;s antitrust counterclaims for failure to state a claim and briefing on that

          Jersey vacated preliminary injunctions against both Dr. Reddy&#8217;s and Alvogen.&#160; Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, Alvogen, and Mylan all launched generic versions of Suboxone Sublingual Film, and the launches by Dr. Reddy&#8217;s and Alvogen are &#8220;at risk&#8221; because the

        <div style="text-indent: 36pt; color: #000000;">On September 22, 2016, forty-one states and the District of Columbia, or the States, brought suit against Indivior and the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,
          alleging violations of federal and state antitrust statutes and state unfair trade and consumer protection laws relating to Indivior&#8217;s launch of Suboxone Sublingual Film in 2010 and seeking an injunction, civil penalties, and disgorgement. The
          case was later consolidated with a multidistrict putative class action, the <font style="font-style: italic;">In re Suboxone (Buprenorphine Hydrochloride and Naloxone) Antitrust Litigation</font>, MDL No. 2445, or the Suboxone MDL. The action
          brought by the States alleges that the Company participated in an antitrust conspiracy with Indivior and also engaged in related conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust law. The Company&#8217;s motion to dismiss was denied by the Court and
          in response we filed an answer denying the States&#8217; claims in November 2017. The fact discovery period and the expert discovery phase closed on or before May 30, 2019, but additional reports and depositions were conducted through August 1, 2019.&#160;
          The remainder of the case schedule is stayed pending resolution of Indivior&#8217;s appeal of a certain District Court class certification ruling. We are not able to determine or predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or provide a reasonable
          estimate, or range of estimates, of the possible outcome or loss, if any, in this matter.</div>

          <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-indent: 36pt;">On December 5, 2019, Neurelis Inc. filed a Complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, alleging Unfair Competition, Defamation, and Malicious Prosecution in connection
            with the Company&#8217;s activities related to its pursuit of FDA approval for Libervant&#8482;.&#160; Neurelis also filed a First Amended Complaint on December 9, 2019, alleging the same three causes of action.&#160; Various answers and motions have been filed by
            the parties since that time, and a hearing is scheduled for April 24, 2020.&#160; We are not able to determine or predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or provide a reasonable estimate, or range of estimate, of the possible outcome or
