<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our lead product candidate is AVA-101 for the treatment of wet AMD. Standard-of-care therapies include the anti-VEGF class, which inhibit vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), a protein that causes abnormal blood vessel growth in wet AMD. Anti-VEGF therapies, such as Lucentis<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, marketed by Genentech, Inc. and Novartis AG, and EYLEA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the United States and Bayer HealthCare LLC outside the United States, represented approximately $6.7 billion in worldwide sales in 2014, and we
believe 65%-80% of those sales were for the treatment of wet AMD. Due to a variety of factors, including inconvenience and discomfort associated with frequent injections in the eye, patient compliance is a significant concern with anti-VEGF
therapies. These treatments require continuous injections every four to eight weeks to maintain efficacy and patients often experience vision loss with reduced frequency of treatment. By contrast, AVA-101 is designed to enable retinal cells to
continuously produce therapeutic levels of a naturally occurring anti-VEGF protein with a single administration. Accordingly, we believe that AVA-101 could transform the treatment paradigm and address a significant unmet need in this large wet AMD
market. In addition to wet AMD, we believe that AVA-101 may have the potential to treat other neovascular diseases of the eye such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have generated human proof-of-concept data for AVA-101 in a Phase 1 trial with eight wet AMD subjects conducted at Lions Eye Institute (LEI) in Australia.
In that Phase&nbsp;1 trial, AVA-101 was well tolerated with no drug-related adverse events. In addition, subjects treated with AVA-101 showed meaningful improvement in their visual acuity test scores (up to 15&nbsp;letter improvement on an eye chart
from baseline), and most subjects did not receive any rescue injections of standard-of-care therapy (required for subjects exhibiting disease progression) during the one-year trial period. </P>

cause of ophthalmic diseases by enabling patients&#146; own cells to express a therapeutic protein for a sustained period of time. We use a vector derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV), which is a small, non-pathogenic virus. DNA encoding the
AAV viral genes are removed and replaced with a therapeutic gene to treat a disease. The resulting vector is used to deliver and express, or transduce, a functional gene to the cells of the eye to promote continuous protein production. Although AAVs
are widely used for gene therapy due to their safety, stability and sustained protein expression, our Ocular BioFactory platform has distinct characteristics that provide advantages over competing gene therapy technologies using AAVs as well as
other viral and non-viral vectors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Ocular BioFactory platform features two key proprietary components: a vector screening and optimization system

physicians can introduce or re-introduce genes that encode a therapeutic protein. Instead of providing proteins or other therapies externally and dosing them over a long period, gene therapy offers the possibility of dosing once or a very limited
number of times to achieve a long-term, durable benefit. Once a patient&#146;s cells have incorporated the therapeutic gene, the cells are able to continue to produce the therapeutic protein for years or, potentially, the rest of the patient&#146;s

approximately 100 clinical trials as of January 2014 demonstrating the increasing acceptance of gene therapy as a safe and effective method for delivering therapeutic genes of interest. The most frequently studied variant of AAV is AAV2, which can
preferentially infect a number of cell types, including those found in the retina. AAV2 is the basis for our lead product AVA-101. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As effective as
existing AAV vectors are in gene therapy, we believe there is an opportunity to advance vector capabilities beyond those currently available. Naturally occurring AAV variants have evolved with particular characteristics, some of which pose
limitations to their use in gene therapy in the eye. Consequently, there is significant room to improve AAV vectors to maximize utility for gene therapy in the eye. Therefore, our other product candidates have been created using our methodology that
gives AAV new and powerful capabilities of cell penetration, gene delivery, protein expression and manufacturability. We believe we can target retinal cells even more precisely with these next-generation AAV vectors, to one or more of the eight cell
layers found in the retina. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to create next-generation vectors, we use a multi-step process known as directed evolution. These vectors are

naturally occurring AAVs. We modify these genes in the laboratory to derive novel combinations of genes that produce vectors exhibiting different properties and capabilities. Once we have created an initial pool of millions of different AAVs, each
with distinct genetic and chemical composition, we screen the AAVs in the pool for their potential therapeutic benefits. We also screen the pool to eliminate vectors that would lead to interference by a host&#146;s antibodies. After identifying a
smaller pool of optimized vectors from this screening process, we repeat the steps of diversity generation and screening until we have identified a select number of ideal, engineered AAVs. These lab-created AAVs represent the basis for our
therapeutic product pipeline. Furthermore, when we develop additional product candidates, we return to the initial pool of novel vectors, or to one or more of the adapted pools we created, and use further applications of directed evolution to create
new AAVs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>Directed Evolution Technology for AAV Discovery and Optimization </B></P>

into the patient&#146;s eye every four to eight weeks. According to the journal <I>Ophthalmology</I> (2012), in the MARINA and ANCHOR trials (conducted by Genentech), a total of 599 subjects received Lucentis every four weeks. Treated subjects in
these trials gained vision, averaging 9.0 letters on a standardized eye chart, and this gain was maintained with injections every four weeks for two years. When 388 of these subjects were subsequently moved to a less-frequent dosing regimen in the
HORIZON study (Genentech), however, their vision declined by 7.0 letters over the next two years. In the SEVEN-UP study reported in the journal <I>Ophthalmology</I> (2013), 65 subjects from the HORIZON study were followed for an additional 3.3 years
and injected less frequently, declining by an additional 10.3 letters. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other clinical trials where subjects were treated less frequently than every 4
weeks have shown similar results. In the PIER study (Genentech), 61 subjects received three doses every 4 weeks, gaining 4.3 letters, but were then switched to 12-week dosing and declined 6.5 letters at two years (British Journal of Ophthalmology,
2009). In the SUSTAIN study (Novartis), 512 subjects received three doses every 4 weeks, gaining 5.8 letters, but were then switched to less frequent &#147;as needed&#148; dosing, and declined 2.2 letters at 12 months (<I>Ophthalmology</I>, 2011);
99 of these subjects continued to be followed in the SECURE study (Novartis) and were treated with less frequent &#147;as needed&#148; dosing and lost an additional 3.6 letters (<I>Ophthalmology</I>, 2013). Similarly, in CATT (United States National
Eye Institute), 130 subjects were dosed monthly for 12 months, gaining 8.5 letters <I>(New England Journal of Medicine</I>, 2011), but then were switched to less-frequent &#147;as needed&#148; dosing and declined by 1.8 letters. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As summarized in the illustrative chart below, patients must comply with a burdensome treatment regimen every 4-8&nbsp;weeks, or face a relative decline in
visual acuity. The chart depicts the results for the MARINA and ANCHOR studies, compared to the decline in visual acuity from less frequent dosing in the other studies, as described above. When injections are given every four weeks, as in the MARINA
and ANCHOR studies, patients initially gain vision and maintain that gain. However, when patients were relieved of injections every four weeks after three months (PIER and SUSTAIN/SECURE trials), twelve months (CATT trial), or two years (HORIZON and
SEVEN-UP trials), the results were similar. </P>

not comply with the prescribed regimen due to the burdensome frequency of administration. According to the <I>European Journal of Ophthalmology</I> (2011), 36% of patients who received anti-VEGF treatment for at least six months had stopped
receiving therapy within a year. Of these patients, 59% had lost visual acuity. In addition, according to the journal <I>Ophthalmology</I> (2013), a study of a subset of 65 patients enrolled in Lucentis pivotal trials reported that only 23% of
patients received more than 11 anti-VEGF treatments over the course of five years following the completion of the original trial. 59% of patients in this trial received fewer than six anti-VEGF injections during the follow up period and they lost an
average of 9.3 letters of visual acuity. Studies examining treatment patterns in the real world report that patients are substantially under-treated, receiving an average of only five to seven injections per year; over time, this under-treatment has
persisted despite evidence of worse visual outcomes (<I>American Journal of Ophthalmology</I>, 2014). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our Solution: AVA-101 </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AVA-101 is comprised of the AAV2 vector, which contains a gene encoding sFLT-1, a naturally occurring anti-VEGF protein. When administered in the eye and
expressed by the host retinal cells, the sFLT-1 protein inhibits the formation of new blood vessels and reduces vascular permeability by binding and blocking VEGF activity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AVA-101 is designed to be administered via a single subretinal injection. The vector is placed into direct contact with retinal cells, which then produce
sFLT-1. We believe that a majority of vitreoretinal surgeons are capable of performing the procedure to deliver AVA-101, which is an outpatient procedure performed under local anesthesia. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on data from preclinical studies, AVA-101 reaches a therapeutically beneficial level of continuous expression of sFLT-1 within six to eight weeks from
administration. In animal models, AVA-101 expression has been shown to last up to 17&nbsp;months, and data from other studies with AAV in the retina have shown gene expression to last more than five years. In humans, AVA-101 has been studied up to
one year, and we believe it has the potential to last much longer. </P>

Participation in the trial was limited to subjects 55 years or older with confirmed neovascular leakage associated with AMD. Subjects were randomized into three groups: control, low AVA-101 dose
(10<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">10</SUP> vector genomes) and high AVA-101 dose (10<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">11</SUP> vector genomes). All subjects received two initial doses of Lucentis at Day 0 and Week 4 and
the subjects in the active arms received AVA-101 on Day 7. Beginning with the Week 8 visit, Lucentis was given as rescue therapy on an as-needed basis. The requirement for rescue therapy was based on objective criteria of disease recurrence as
judged by personnel that were unaware of the subjects&#146; treatment group. Subjects were assessed every four weeks for adverse events, retinal thickness, visual acuity and the need for Lucentis rescue injections. </P>

CDC, approximately 7.3&nbsp;million patients in the United States are at high risk of developing wet AMD. Within this group, we believe that we can identify a subset of the patients at the highest risk of progressing to wet AMD through a combination
of clinical and genetic factors. We believe these patients represent a highly motivated subgroup who could benefit from AVA-201 by preventing the progression from intermediate AMD to advanced wet AMD and the associated vision loss. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AVA-201 is our next generation anti-VEGF gene therapy product candidate, which we are developing for the prevention of wet AMD. AVA-201 delivers the same
sFLT-1 expressing gene as AVA-101 but uses next-generation AAV vector delivery method. AVA-201 is administered by an intravitreal injection directly into the vitreous, the jelly-like substance inside the eye. Intravitreal injections are commonly
performed, and represent a relatively convenient and low-risk procedure. Furthermore, AVA-201 uses an AAV vector that has been specifically selected through our proprietary directed evolution technology to overcome the physical barrier presented by
the anatomy of the retina, leading to high rates of transduction of retinal cells. Based on the features of AVA-201, we are positioning this product candidate for prophylaxis use in patients with earlier forms of AMD. We expect to begin IND-enabling
studies in 2015. We own exclusive rights for the development and commercialization of AVA-201 worldwide. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>AVA-201 Preclinical Study </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To establish proof of concept for the prevention of wet AMD, we tested whether sFLT-1 could prevent the onset of wet AMD symptoms in a non-human primate model.
In this study, published in the journal <I>Molecular Therapy</I> (2005), non-human primates were transduced with AAV encoding sFLT-1 in one eye, and a control vector in the other eye. At 16 months, choroidal neovascularization, or growth of new
blood vessels in the choroid of the eye, was induced by laser irradiation and assessed at two and four weeks. While 46% of control eyes developed lesions by Week 4, none of the treated eyes developed lesions. Therefore, a single dose of the
treatment had prevented disease development 17 months later. This initial study, which used AVA-101 as a proof-of-concept, demonstrated that upregulation of sFLT-1 could effectively prevent development of choroidal neovascularization, a major
symptom of wet AMD. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">XLRS is an inherited retinal disease that occurs almost exclusively in males. It is caused by mutations in the RS1 gene located on the X chromosome. The RS1
protein binds to the surface of the photoreceptors and biopolar cells in the retina and is crucial in maintaining the tissue&#146;s integrity. Disruption in the production of the RS1 protein may cause schisis, or splitting, of the retinal layers or
leakage in the blood vessels of the retina. These complications lead to severe vision impairment or blindness and often manifest early in childhood. We believe that approximately 10,000 boys and young men suffer from XLRS. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of our Collaboration Agreement with Regeneron, we are conducting studies on AVA-311 for the potential treatment of XLRS, a genetic disease affecting
boys and young men with no approved therapy. Regeneron will be responsible for various preclinical studies of AVA-311 conducted as part of our collaboration. AVA-311 is comprised of an optimized AAV vector using our directed evolution technology
that intravitreally delivers the RS1 gene in the eye to potentially achieve a functional cure for patients. As part of our collaboration with Regeneron, if it exercises its option it will be responsible for all preclinical studies and clinical
trials for AVA-311 and will retain worldwide commercialization rights. We have the option to share up to 35% of the development costs and profits from this product candidate. </P>

suppressing the RS1 gene in mice. The mice were given a single intravitreal injection of AVA-311 in one eye, and the other eye was left untreated. Mice were monitored for four months. As shown in the immunofluorescence images in Row&nbsp;1 below,
treated eyes exhibited high levels of RS1 protein expression, localized in photoreceptor outer segments of the retina, at levels that are comparable to those found in normal eyes. In addition, as shown in Row&nbsp;2 by the fundus photographs of the

Under the license agreement, the Regents have granted to us an exclusive (even as to the Regents) license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the Regents&#146; undivided interest in patent rights covering a method of using recombinant gene
delivery vectors for treating or preventing diseases of the eye, to develop, make, have made, use offer for sale, import, export and sell products covered by such patent rights in all fields of use in the United States. The licensed patent rights
are jointly owned by the Regents and Chiron Corporation, but our license extends only to the Regents&#146; interest in such patent rights. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the

resulting licensed products in sufficient quantity to meet market demand. We have the right and option to extend the date by which we must meet any milestone by six-months up to two times by paying an extension fee for each such extension. </P>

development of the licensed products for one indication, and totaling up to $500,000 for each subsequent indication for which licensed products are developed, for up to a maximum of two additional indications. We must pay the Regents a low
single-digit royalty on net sales of the licensed products by us or our sublicensees, subject to a minimum annual royalty payment of $50,000 beginning in the calendar year after the first commercial sale of a licensed product, until the patent
rights upon which such royalties are based expire or are held invalid, which is currently expected to occur in 2020, subject to any potential patent term extensions. We are obligated to reimburse the Regents for expenses associated with the

Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of subjects, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for

with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and
purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. </P>

information on the composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews a BLA or an NDA to determine, among other things,
whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once a BLA or an NDA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180&nbsp;days to
review the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding
to BLAs and NDAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review, but this timeframe is also often extended and FDA review may not occur in a timely basis at all. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review,
evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA or an NDA if the
applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not
satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Moreover, even if a product receives approval, the approval may be significantly limited to
specific disease and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Once the FDA approves a BLA or an NDA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing
regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such product or require a recall of any biologic
or drug already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase&nbsp;IV clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics or drugs which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority
to prevent or limit further marketing of a biologic or drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Drugs and biologics may be marketed
only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the
applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement or a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished biologic or drug product, and sometimes, for drug
products, the active drug ingredient, is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not
approve the product unless compliance with GCP requirements is satisfactory. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and
financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our product candidates for the
treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or
unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the
commercial application of the biologics or drugs. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending
on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement or an NDA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any biologics or drugs manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA,
including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Biologic and drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies,
and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third
party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or
possible civil penalties. Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are also required following the FDA approval of a BLA or an NDA. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will
be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials,
require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA for that biologic or the NDA for that drug. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA closely regulates
the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics and drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities
involving the internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and
potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product&#146;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common
across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however,
impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#146; communications regarding off-label use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations </I></B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and
markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government
authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the
payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer&#146;s
decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate
return on our investment in product development. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and
cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies
in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If
third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow
a company to sell its products at a profit. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs,
including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that </P>

may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the rebate program to
individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and
annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#146; share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could
limit payments for pharmaceuticals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the
government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on
pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable
coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>International Regulation </I></B></P>

expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our clinical trial and development programs for AVA-101, a gene therapy product targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) currently under development for the
treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and our other product candidates. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we reported a net loss of $25.4 million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $36.7
million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our clinical trials, research and development programs and from our general and administrative expenses. In the future, we intend to continue to conduct research and development,
clinical testing, regulatory compliance activities and, if AVA-101 or any of our other product candidates is approved, sales and marketing activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in us
incurring significant losses for the next several years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We currently generate no revenue from sales, and we may never be able to commercialize AVA-101

FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified
investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The study population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically
meaningful. Generally, the patient population for any clinical studies conducted outside of the United States must be representative of the population for whom we intend to label the product in the United States. In addition, while these clinical
trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its determination that the studies also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data
from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept the data from our clinical trials for AVA-101 or any other product candidates, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and
time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of AVA-101 or any other product candidates. The FDA may also determine that additional safety or other data are needed before we may commence a Phase 2b clinical trial which could require
us to conduct additional trials before we proceed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our Ocular BioFactory is based on a novel gene therapy technology, which makes it difficult to

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the clinical study requirements of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory
agencies and the criteria these regulators may use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory
approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the
FDA has not approved any gene therapy products for sale and only one gene therapy product has been approved in the Western world, which makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for
our product candidates in either Europe or the United States. Approvals by the EMA may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products may change in the future. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue
and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Gene
therapy clinical studies conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) may also be subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities&#146; Recombinant DNA
Advisory Committee (RAC). Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC review process can impede the initiation of a clinical study, even if the FDA has reviewed the study and approved its initiation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Conversely, the FDA can put an Investigational New Drug application (IND) on clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable review. Also, before a
clinical study can begin at an NIH-funded institution, that institution&#146;s institutional review board (IRB) and its Institutional Biosafety Committee will have to review the proposed clinical study to assess the safety of the study. In addition,
adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to
perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations
or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we may be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups, and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our
product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business.

risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by
the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new drugs based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to
obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us or any of our future development partners from commercializing our product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population,
the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians&#146; and patients&#146; perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product
candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. We will be required to identify and enroll a sufficient number of subjects with wet AMD for each
of our planned clinical trials of AVA-101. Potential subjects for AVA-101 may not be adequately diagnosed or identified with the diseases which we are targeting or may not meet the entry criteria for our studies. We also may encounter difficulties
in identifying and enrolling wet AMD subjects with a stage of disease appropriate for our planned clinical trials. In addition, we and our collaboration partner, Regeneron, are developing AVA-311 for the treatment of X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS),
an orphan indication. Enrollment of eligible subjects with orphan diseases may be limited or slower than we anticipate in light of the small subject populations involved. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we are unable to
locate a sufficient number of eligible subjects to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, the process of finding and diagnosing subjects may prove costly. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to initiate a Phase 2b clinical trial for AVA-101 in the United States in the second half of 2015. If patients are unwilling to participate in our
gene therapy studies because of negative publicity from adverse events in the biotechnology or gene therapy industries or for other reasons, including competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations or available approved therapies, the
timeline for recruiting subjects, conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates may be delayed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Trials using early
versions of retroviral vectors, which integrate with, and thereby alter, the host cell&#146;s DNA, have led to several well-publicized adverse events. For example, generalized public backlash developed against gene therapy following the death in
September 1999 of an 18-year-old who had volunteered for a gene therapy experiment at the University of Pennsylvania. Researchers at the university had infused the volunteer&#146;s liver with a gene aimed at reversing a rare metabolic disease of the
liver. The procedure triggered an extreme immune-system reaction that caused multiple-organ failure in a very short time, leading to the first death to occur as a direct result of a gene therapy experiment. In addition, in 2003, 20 subjects treated
for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency in two gene therapy studies using a murine gamma-retroviral vector showed correction of the disease, but the studies were terminated after five subjects developed leukemia (four of whom were subsequently
cured). The cause of these adverse events was shown to be insertional oncogenesis, which is the process whereby the corrected gene inserts near a gene that is important in a critical cellular process like growth or division, and this insertion
results in the development of a cancer (often leukemia). Using molecular diagnostic techniques, it was determined that clones from these subjects showed retrovirus insertion in proximity to the promoter of the LMO2 proto-oncogene. Earlier generation
retroviruses like the one used in these two studies have been shown to preferentially integrate in regulatory regions of genes that control cell growth. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of subjects for any of our future clinical trials
would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe we have appropriately accounted for
the above factors in our trials when determining expected clinical trial timelines, but we cannot assure you that our assumptions are correct or that we will not experience delays in enrollment, which would result in the delay of completion of such
trials beyond our expected timelines. </P>

Various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have been reported from time-to-time during clinical trials of our product candidates. It is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical programs, or as
use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected
in previous trials, will be reported by subjects. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational products are tested in large-scale, Phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a
commercial scale after approval. If additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates has side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed, or,

may limit our ability to successfully develop and/or commercialize AVA-101. These serious and potentially life-threatening risks, based on clinical and preclinical experience of VEGF inhibitors, include bleeding, intestinal perforation,
hypertension, proteinuria, congestive heart failure, heart attack, stroke and geographic atrophy. In addition, patients given infusions of any protein may develop severe hypersensitivity reactions or infusion reactions. Other VEGF inhibitors have
reported side effects that became evident only after large-scale trials or after marketing approval when large numbers of patients were treated. There are risks in treating patients with gene therapy vectors, including adeno-associated virus (AAV),
such as inflammation, cytotoxic T-cell response, anti-AAV antibodies and immune response to the expressed transgene, including T-cell responses and/or auto-antibodies against sFLT-1. There are risks inherent in the subretinal administration of drugs
like AVA-101, which can cause injury to the eye and other complications. For example, in our Phase 1/2a trials of AVA-101 in wet AMD, the most frequent ocular adverse events to date have been subconjunctival hemorrhage, vitreous hemorrhage, cataract
progression and intra-ocular inflammation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There are also risks inherent in subretinal injections, including subretinal injections with AVA-101, such as

have relationships with a single supplier for the manufacturing of our viral vectors and product candidates. The supplier may require licenses to manufacture such components if such processes are not owned by the supplier or in the public domain and
we may be unable to transfer or sublicense the intellectual property rights we may have with respect to such activities. All entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical studies or commercial sale, including our existing
contract manufacturer for our product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical studies must be manufactured in accordance with current
Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and
products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that may not be detectable
in final product testing. We or our contract manufacturer must supply all necessary documentation in support of a BLA on a timely basis and must adhere to the FDA&#146;s current Good Laboratory Practice regulations and cGMP regulations enforced by
the FDA through its facilities inspection program. Our contract manufacturer has not produced a commercially-approved product and therefore has not obtained the requisite FDA approvals to do so. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities
and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates or any of our other potential
products. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party contractors involved with the preparation of our product candidates or our other potential products or the
associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If the facility does not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, FDA approval of the products will not be granted. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party
contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant
regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical study or commercial sales or the temporary or
permanent closure of a facility. Such violations could also result in civil and/or criminal penalties. Any such remedial measures or other civil and/or criminal penalties imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm
our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we or our third-party manufacturer fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among
other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug product or biologic product, revocation of a pre-existing approval, other civil or criminal penalties or closing one or more manufacturing facilities. As a result, our business,
financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, if supply from an approved manufacturer is interrupted, there could
be a significant disruption in commercial supply. An alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a BLA supplement which could result in further delay. The regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer
is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturers may involve substantial costs and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These factors could cause the delay of clinical studies, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us
to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our products successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a
substantially equivalent cost, our clinical studies may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue. </P>

develop and to manufacture our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements,
consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third
parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk
that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how
and trade secrets, a competitor&#146;s independent discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially
relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the future will usually expect to be granted rights to publish data arising
out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration,
in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our
research and development or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of
information by any of our third-party collaborators. A competitor&#146;s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business. </P>

States for our product candidates, we need to submit the results of preclinical testing to the FDA, along with other information including information about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing and controls and our proposed clinical trial
protocol, as part of an IND. We may rely in part on preclinical, clinical and quality data generated by CROs and other third parties for regulatory submissions for our product candidates. If these third parties do not make timely regulatory
submissions for our product candidates, it will delay our plans for our clinical trials. If those third parties do not make this data available to us, we will likely have to develop all necessary preclinical and clinical data on our own, which will
lead to significant delays and increase development costs of the product candidate. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical testing for any product candidate before it allows us to initiate clinical testing under any
IND, which may lead to additional delays and increase the costs of our preclinical development. Delays in the commencement or completion of our planned clinical trials for AVA-101 or other product candidates could significantly affect our product
development costs. We do not know whether our planned trials will begin on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to: </P>

reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. If we experience delays in completion of our clinical trials, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB, other reviewing entities, or
any of our clinical trial sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical trials, the commercial prospects for a product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause,
or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. For example, if we make manufacturing or formulation
changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Further, if one or more clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market

50 in developed countries, our projections of the number of people who have wet AMD, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with wet AMD, are based on estimates. These estimates have been
derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations and market research and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these
diseases. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. The effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in early stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible.
Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely

legislation expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient drug purchases by those covered by Medicare under a new Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices
for Medicare Part B physician-administered drugs, including drugs currently on the market used by physicians to treat wet AMD and likely AVA-101, if approved. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products,
there is additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates,
and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of the MMA could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we
receive for any approved products, and could seriously harm our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by
the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, was enacted with a goal of reducing the cost of healthcare and substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both government and
private insurers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or
injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations and established annual fees and taxes on
manufacturers of certain prescription drugs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the Affordable Care Act was
enacted. On August&nbsp;2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for
the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2%&nbsp;per fiscal
year, which went into effect on April&nbsp;1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that
additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal, state and foreign governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our

have significantly greater financial, product candidate development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval
for drugs. In addition, universities and private and public research institutes may be active in wet AMD research, and some could be in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit management, scientists and
clinical development personnel. We will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, registering subjects for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates. Smaller or early-stage

Switzerland, Australia, Japan and certain other countries for the treatment of wet AMD. Additionally, marketing approval has been obtained in the EU for EYLEA for the treatment of visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to CRVO. We will not

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our current management team has only been working together for a relatively short period of time and some of our current management team have been employed by
us for less than a year. Moreover, we expect to continue to expand our management team in the future. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate recently and subsequently hired executive officers into our
management team and their ability to develop and maintain an effective working relationship. Our failure to integrate these individuals with other members of management could result in inefficiencies in the development and commercialization of our
product candidates, harming future regulatory approvals, sales of our product candidates and our results of operations. In addition to the competition for personnel, the San Francisco Bay Area in particular is characterized by a high cost of living.
As such, we could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because as of February&nbsp;28, 2015 we have only 52 full-time employees, we will need to grow our organization substantially to continue development and
pursue the potential commercialization of AVA-101 and our other product candidates, as well as function as a public company. As we seek to advance AVA-101 and other product candidates, we will need to expand our financial, development, regulatory,
manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers
and other third parties. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management and require us to retain additional internal capabilities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product
candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate
additional management, clinical and regulatory, financial, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to so accomplish could prevent us from successfully growing our company. </P>

purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include
anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and
formula managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve
remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as
private payers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among
other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program,
willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the
delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statute governing healthcare fraud statutes. A
person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a
violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, the False
Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by
a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant
liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The
government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements,
it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers&#146; and manufacturers&#146; compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The
Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate
family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1&nbsp;million per year for &#147;knowing failures&#148;), for all payments,
transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. The period between August&nbsp;1, 2013 and December&nbsp;31, 2013 was the first reporting period, and
manufacturers were required to report aggregate payment data by March&nbsp;31, 2014, and to report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by June&nbsp;30, 2014. Thereafter, manufacturers must submit reports
by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts,
compensation and other remuneration to physicians. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the course of conducting our business, we may also obtain certain confidential patient health

respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January&nbsp;25, 2013. Additionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA.
HIPAA, HITECH and comparable state laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic

candidates, or one of our future product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable in whole or in part. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or
unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could
include an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, even outside
the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and
the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. Such a

to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if

formulations may be held by others. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product candidates.
The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may
consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources, and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a

of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing
patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve a high degree of technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, Congress may pass
patent reform legislation that is unfavorable to us. The Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in
certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by
the United States Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents we might
obtain in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. </I></B></P>

United States and other countries, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on AVA-101 and our other product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries
outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States.
Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other
jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but
enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of
certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the
infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention

To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we will need to upgrade our financial reporting systems including our information technology systems;
implement additional financial reporting controls, and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we (or our auditors if they are required to assess and attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting) are unable

control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and which related to the design and operation of our control environment. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#146;s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We did not maintain an effective
control environment, which is the foundation for effective internal control over financial reporting, as evidenced by: (i)&nbsp;an insufficient number of personnel to perform control monitoring activities, (ii)&nbsp;an insufficient number of
personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge of U.S. GAAP to determine that our consolidated financial statements were properly prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, (iii)&nbsp;insufficient management involvement to identify and resolve errors
in recording transactions and (iv)&nbsp;inadequate processes for the preparation and review of our consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subsequent to the

controls and the related documentation and (c)&nbsp;strengthened our accounting systems, financial statements review procedures and the supervisory reviews by our management that are performed during the financial close process and which support the
accurate and timely preparation of consolidated financial statements that are fairly presented in accordance with US GAAP.&nbsp;These improvements to our internal control infrastructure were implemented during 2014, and were in place in connection
with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. As such, we believe that these initiatives have remediated the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of
December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 we

the event of a delisting, we would expect to take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ&#146;s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again,

on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, although
circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if we become a large accelerated filer (in which case we will cease to be an emerging company as of the date we become a large accelerated filer, which, generally, would occur if,
at the end of a fiscal year, among other things, the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter), if we have total annual
gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year (in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of December&nbsp;31 of such fiscal year), or if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three
year period before that time (in which case we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately). Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a &#147;smaller reporting company,&#148; which would
allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of Sarbanes-Oxley and reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation and our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less

of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the
SEC, and The NASDAQ Global Market to implement provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in
corporate governance practices. Further, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas, such as mandatory &#147;say on pay&#148; voting
requirements that will apply to us when we cease to be an emerging growth company. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new
regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. </P>

adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in
other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be
required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees
or as executive officers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about

ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future and we may never achieve profitability. To the
extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of
approximately $39.6&nbsp;million to offset future federal income. NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2026. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company also had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of approximately $41.0 million to offset future state
income. U.S. State NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2016. If over a rolling three-year period, the cumulative change in our ownership exceeds 50 percentage points (as determined under applicable Treasury regulations) under
Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), our ability to utilize our U.S. federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset future taxable
income or taxes may be limited. We have experienced at least two ownership changes since inception and our utilization of NOL carryforwards will therefore be subject to annual limitation. Our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards may be further
limited as a result of subsequent ownership changes. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Such limitations could result in the expiration of our carryforwards before they can be utilized and, if we are profitable, our future cash flows
could be adversely affected due to our increased tax liability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><A NAME="rom849882_4"></A>Item&nbsp;1B. Unresolved Staff Comments </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing novel gene therapies to transform the lives of patients with
sight-threatening ophthalmic diseases. We have leveraged our next-generation gene therapy platform, Ocular BioFactory<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">TM</SUP>, to create a robust pipeline of product candidates. Our product candidates
are designed to provide long-term efficacy or a functional cure for these diseases by inducing a sustained expression of a therapeutic protein with a one-time administration in the eye. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are targeting a variety of prevalent and rare genetic ophthalmic diseases with significant unmet medical need. Our lead product candidate is AVA-101 for
the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We believe that this product candidate could transform the treatment paradigm and address the unmet need in the large wet AMD market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have generated human proof-of-concept data for AVA-101 in a Phase 1 trial with eight wet AMD subjects conducted at Lions Eye Institute (LEI) in Australia.
In that Phase 1 trial, AVA-101 was well tolerated with no drug-related adverse events. In addition, subjects treated with AVA-101 showed meaningful improvement in their visual acuity test scores (up to 15 letter improvement on an eye chart from
baseline), and most subjects did not receive any rescue injections of standard-of-care therapy (required for subjects exhibiting disease progression) during the one-year trial period. We are currently conducting a Phase 2a trial for AVA-101 at LEI
with 32 additional wet AMD subjects. Interim drug safety surveillance data received in June 2014 from this ongoing study suggests that AVA-101 continues to be well tolerated. Most adverse events that have been observed to date are mild and not
related to AVA-101 or the procedures used in the study. Adverse events related to study procedures include subconjunctival, vitreous and retinal hemorrhage, cataract progression and eye pain. Other infrequent adverse events may be related to study
procedures, including retinal tears or holes and falls. A small number of adverse events may be possibly related to AVA-101, including inflammation and light chain analysis increase, but these were considered mild and transient and have not been
associated with vision loss. We expect to receive top-line data from this ongoing Phase&nbsp;2a trial in mid-2015. We own exclusive rights to develop and commercialize AVA-101 worldwide. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to AVA-101, our Ocular BioFactory platform has generated other promising product candidates for the treatment of severe ophthalmic diseases,
including AVA-201 and AVA-311. We are developing AVA-201 as a next-generation product candidate for the prevention of wet AMD. AVA-201 produces the same anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein as AVA-101 using a proprietary,
customized delivery mechanism, or vector, that can be administered earlier in the disease progression, before the onset of wet AMD. We own worldwide rights to AVA-201. AVA-311 is being developed in collaboration with our partner Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) for the treatment of X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a rare genetic disease of the retina with no approved therapy. Based on preclinical studies to date, AVA-311 has been shown to delay the progression of XLRS and
improve vision by effectively delivering functional copies of the RS1 gene in retinal cells of mice. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to accelerate the pace of generating and
developing product candidates for our pipeline, we entered into a broad research collaboration and license agreement with Regeneron in May 2014. Under the terms of the agreement, we intend to jointly discover novel product candidates based on our
Ocular BioFactory platform for up to eight therapeutic targets including AVA-311. We have received initial payments of $8.0 million as well as ongoing support for research and development, and we are eligible to receive up to $80.0 million in

$36.7 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses. We expect to incur substantial losses from operations in the foreseeable future as we continue our research and development efforts, advance
AVA-101 and other product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, manufacture clinical study materials, seek regulatory approval and prepare for, and if approved, proceed to commercialization. We are at an early stage of development

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the IPO, we financed our operations through private placements of convertible notes and preferred stock with our investors, funding under our

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to incur significant and increasing losses from operations for the foreseeable future, and we can
provide no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits. In April 2014, we received gross proceeds of $52.9 million from the sale of shares of Series B convertible preferred stock, of which $4.0 million was used to repurchase
outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock from an existing investor. We also converted the outstanding balance under our related-party convertible notes of $2.0 million into shares of Series B convertible preferred stock. In May
2014, we received initial payments of $8.0 million in connection with our collaboration with Regeneron. On August&nbsp;5, 2014, we completed our IPO of shares of our common stock, sold stock in a concurrent private placement and received net
proceeds of $116.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had $159.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe we will have sufficient funds to operate through at
least December&nbsp;31, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization
of AVA-101 and any additional product candidates. Specifically, we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with our existing Phase 2a clinical trial and any Phase&nbsp;2b and Phase&nbsp;3 clinical trials
that we may conduct for AVA-101. We will need substantial additional funding to support our operating activities as we advance AVA-101 and other potential product candidates through clinical development, seek regulatory approval and prepare for, and
if approved, proceed to commercialization. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Revenue </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To date we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our products. In May 2014, we entered into a multi-year license and development agreement with
Regeneron. Under the terms of the agreement, we received initial payments of $8.0 million that included payment for research license fees, prepaid collaboration research costs and the right of first negotiation for a potential license to develop and
commercialize AVA-101. As the agreement provides for multiple deliverables, we account for this agreement as a multiple elements revenue arrangement. If deliverables do not appear to have a standalone fair value, they were combined with other
deliverables into a unit of accounting with standalone fair value. We allocated the $8.0 million received to the fair values of the two units of accounting identified in the arrangement. We expect to recognize $6.5 million for research licenses and
related research and development services ratably over the associated period of performance, which is the maximum research period of eight years. As there is no discernible pattern of performance and/or objectively measurable performance measures do
not exist, we will recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the eight-year performance period. The remaining $1.5 million allocated to the second unit of accounting for the time-limited right of first negotiation for AVA-101 is deferred and
will be recognized during the period when Regeneron has exclusive access to the results of Phase 2a clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2014, we recognized $0.5 million under the Regeneron agreement. Prior to that period, we had previously only recognized revenue in connection with a license agreement for our technology and under government grants. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to generate product revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the amount or timing of product revenue. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of our products, we may be unable to
continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Research and Development Expenses </I></B></P>

based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will
be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. We estimate the amounts incurred through communications with third party service providers and our estimates of accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date are based on
information available at the time. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As we pursue the clinical development of our lead product candidate, AVA-101, the amount of research and development expenses will continue to grow. Product
candidates in later stages of clinical development have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of late-stage clinical trials. Accordingly, we plan to increase
our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to complete the development and commercialization of AVA-101. The successful development and commercialization of AVA-101 is highly uncertain and we cannot reasonably
estimate the nature, timing or costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of AVA-101 at this time. Clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development and commercialization costs
can differ materially from expectations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We received refundable tax credits from the Australian tax authorities in connection with certain research costs
incurred by our subsidiary conducting research in Australia. These refunds do not depend on our taxable income or tax position and therefore we do not account for them under an income tax accounting model. We recognize such refunds as government
grants in the period when qualified expenses are incurred as a reduction of research expenses. We have recorded the reimbursement from the Australian tax authorities as a reduction of research and development expense in the consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive loss for the applicable period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>General and Administrative Expenses </I></B></P>

and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses. We anticipate general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we invest in the infrastructure needed to
support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. We also anticipate increased expenses related to audit, legal and regulatory functions, as well as director and officer insurance
premiums and investor relations costs associated with being a public reporting company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Other Income (Expense), Net </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other income (expense), net is comprised mainly of changes in the fair value of common stock warrant liabilities and preferred stock warrant liabilities. For a

estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards to non-employees is recognized based on the then-current fair value at each measurement date
over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term, using the accelerated attribution method. We have used the Black-Scholes valuation model to assist us in determining the fair value of stock-based awards. The
Black-Scholes valuation model requires the use of subjective and highly complex assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. </P>

company; business risks; and management and board experience. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The independent third-party valuations used the income, guideline and transaction
approaches based on our expected future cash flows and applied a discount for lack of marketability. The guideline approach measures value on a minority-interest basis; the transaction and income approaches measure value on a controlling basis. This
approach is outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Practice Aid, &#147;<I>Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation</I>&#148; as the probability-weighted expected return method
(PWERM). Enterprise values were calculated based on three exit scenarios, including an IPO, a partnership for the development of our product candidate either in an earlier stage or a late stage of clinical development and a corporate failure. Each
value was weighted based on the probability of each event&#146;s occurrence to arrive at an indicated enterprise value. In estimating the value of equities, management estimated a term for each of the IPO, partnership or corporate failure scenarios.

directors in reevaluating the fair value of our convertible preferred stock. The estimated fair value of our Series A convertible preferred stock was determined using a PWERM model, as discussed above in the fair value of common stock. On
August&nbsp;28, 2012, we entered into a convertible note payable agreement with a related party investor for the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 million of convertible notes (2012 Notes). On November&nbsp;12, 2013,
we issued 1,419,959 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock upon the conversion of the 2012 Notes, and issued 689,655 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to a potential collaborator for cash, in each case at a price of $1.45 per
share. The estimated fair value of Series A convertible preferred stock was $2.63 per share on the issuance date. In fiscal 2013, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of the 2012 Notes of $1.7 million, and an expense of $0.8 million associated with
collaboration acquisitions costs which are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P>

license agreement we entered into with LEI in 2010. Both the convertible preferred stock warrants and the obligation to issue a warrant to purchase common stock were accounted for as liabilities
and were initially recorded at fair value. We have recorded the obligation to issue a warrant to purchase common stock as a derivative liability as the terms of the warrants are not fixed due to potential adjustments in the exercise price issuable
under the warrants.&nbsp;At each balance sheet date, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of these liabilities are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss while
such instruments are outstanding and classified as liabilities. The fair value of the liabilities is determined using an option pricing model, based on inputs as of the valuation measurement dates, including the estimated fair value of our stock,
the estimated volatility of the price of our stock, the expected term of the warrants and the risk-free interest rates. Refer to Note 10, Warrants, for key assumptions used in the valuation at each reporting period, in our consolidated financial
statements included this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The convertible preferred stock and common stock warrant liabilities will increase or decrease each period based on the fluctuations of the fair value of the underlying security. A significant
fluctuation in the common or convertible preferred stock fair value would result in a material change in the fair values of the convertible preferred stock and common stock warrant liabilities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We adjusted the obligation to issue a warrant to purchase common stock liability for changes in fair value on an ongoing basis until the warrant was issued in
March 2014 and the exercise price for the warrants became fixed. At such time we reclassified the liability to additional paid-in capital and no further change in fair value were recorded. In connection with the completion of the IPO in August 2014,
all of the outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock were exercised. As a result of the exercises, we recorded a $0.8 million loss related to the change in fair value in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss and reclassified the fair value of $0.9 million to stockholders&#146; equity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Income Tax </B></P>

periodically evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon realizability of our deferred tax assets. Based upon the weight of available evidence, which includes our historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since
inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 of approximately $12.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively. We
intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company also had approximately $0.2 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which may be available to offset future foreign income; these carryforwards do not expire. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under Section&nbsp;382 of the Code, our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be
limited if we have experienced an &#147;ownership change.&#148; Generally, a Section&nbsp;382 ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase of more than 50 percentage points in the stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of
stockholders who own at least 5% of a corporation&#146;s stock within a specified testing period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We believe that we have experienced at least two ownership changes under Section&nbsp;382 which will
result in limitations in our ability to utilized net operating losses and credits. In addition, we may experience ownership changes as a result of our previous or future offerings or other changes in the ownership of our stock. As a result, the

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Research and development expense increased to $17.0 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 from $2.2 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2013. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increases of $7.0 million in stock-based compensation expenses, $3.0 million in expenses related to an increase in our employee headcount, $2.5 million in drug product
process development expenses and laboratory supplies and $1.6 million in external consulting expenses and research studies. Expenses during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 benefited from reimbursement of $0.8 million from the Australian tax
authorities recorded as a reduction in research and development expense as compared to $0.1 million during 2014. For the periods presented, substantially all of our research and development expense related to our development activity for AVA-101 for
the treatment of wet AMD, and the other potential product candidates in our development program. We expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our pipeline products and AVA-101 in late-stage
clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>General and Administrative Expense </I></P>

December&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases of $1.8 million related in an increase in our employee headcount, $1.1&nbsp;million in stock-based compensation expenses, $1.6 million in
public company-related expenses and overhead and $2.5&nbsp;million in consulting and professional service expenses, as we expanded our operations. We also recorded a $0.8 million non-cash one-time charge of collaboration acquisition costs in 2013
related to the issuance of 689,655 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to a potential collaborator for cash at a price per share below the fair value of such shares. We expect general and administrative costs to increase in future
periods, reflecting both the increased costs in connection with the future commercialization of AVA-101 and our pipeline products, as well as an expanded infrastructure and increased professional fees associated with being a public company. </P>

preferred stock at 90% of the purchase price paid by other investors, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $0.2 million in 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2013, we amended the terms of the convertible notes agreement to accelerate their conversion into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock,
which we determined represented an extinguishment. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $1.7 million in 2013. </P>

expense was primarily due to the recognition of $0.8 million of collaboration acquisition costs related to the issuance of 689,655 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to a potential collaborator for cash at a price per share below the
fair value of such shares. We also experienced an increase in stock-based compensation and consulting and professional services expenses of $0.5 million, and an increase in facility expense of $0.2 million during 2013 as we expanded our operations.

$65,000 in 2013 as compared to the 2012 period. The increase was due to an increase in the balance of convertible notes outstanding during 2013 as compared to 2012. </P>

an embedded derivative liability in connection with our 2012 Notes. We recorded change in the fair value of this derivative in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. In November 2013, upon conversion of the convertible
notes into Series A convertible preferred stock, the embedded derivative was terminated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Changes in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities decreased $0.1 million as compared to year 2012 due to the remeasurement of the fair value of the common stock
warrant and preferred stock warrant liabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Loss on Extinguishment of Related Party Convertible Notes </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November 2013, we amended the terms of the convertible notes agreement to accelerate their conversion into shares of Series A convertible preferred stock,
which we determined represented an extinguishment. As a result, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of convertible notes of $1.7 million in 2013. </P>

government grants and revenue from research collaboration and license agreements. In April 2014, we received gross proceeds of $52.9 million from the sale of Series B convertible preferred stock, of which $4.0 million was used to repurchase
outstanding shares of Series A convertible preferred stock from an existing investor. We also converted the outstanding balance under our convertible notes into shares of Series B convertible preferred stock. In May 2014, we received initial
payments of $8.0 million in connection with our research collaboration. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2014, we received net proceeds of $116.5 million from the sale of common stock in our IPO and the
concurrent private placement from Regeneron. In January 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of 2,369,375 shares of our common stock, which includes 359,918 shares we issued pursuant to the underwriters&#146; exercise of their option to purchase
additional shares, and we received net proceeds of approximately $130.5 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that our existing cash balance of $159.4 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and cash received from the follow-on public offering in January 2015
will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least December&nbsp;31, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future

approval for our lead product candidate, as well as to build the sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, we will require substantial additional funding.

ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, including the remediation of the material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, as described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 at the reasonable assurance level. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management previously identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that constituted a material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and which related to the design and operation of our control environment. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over
financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#146;s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We did not maintain an
effective control environment, which is the foundation for effective internal control over financial reporting, as evidenced by: (i)&nbsp;an insufficient number of personnel to perform control monitoring activities, (ii)&nbsp;an insufficient number
of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge of U.S. GAAP to determine that our consolidated financial statements were properly prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, (iii)&nbsp;insufficient management involvement to identify and resolve
errors in recording transactions and (iv)&nbsp;inadequate processes for the preparation and review of our consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Remediation of Material Weakness </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subsequent to the identification of the material weakness, we hired an experienced Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Controller and additional
skilled accounting and finance staff members, (b)&nbsp;formalized and implemented our accounting policies and internal controls and the related documentation and (c)&nbsp;strengthened our accounting systems, financial statements review procedures
and the supervisory reviews by our management that are performed during the financial close process and which support the accurate and timely preparation of consolidated financial statements that are fairly presented in accordance with US
GAAP.&nbsp;These improvements to our internal control infrastructure were implemented during 2014, and were in place in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. As such, we
believe that these initiatives have remediated the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P>

in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Inherent Limitations of Controls </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
all error and all fraud. Controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have
been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of
some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. </P>

audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc. and its subsidiary (collectively the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, convertible preferred stock and stockholders&#146; equity (deficit), and cash flows for the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of their internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc. and its subsidiary as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">/s/ Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche

sight-threatening ophthalmic diseases. Since the Company&#146;s inception, it has devoted its efforts principally to performing research and development activities, including early clinical trials, filing patent applications, obtaining regulatory
approvals, hiring personnel, and raising capital to support these activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has not generated any revenue from the sale of products since
its inception. The Company has experienced net losses since its inception and has an accumulated deficit of $36.7 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. The Company expects to incur losses and have negative net cash flows from operating activities as
it expands its portfolio and engages in further research and development activities, particularly conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Use of Estimates</B>&#151;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases estimates and assumptions on historical experience when available and on various factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an
ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to clinical trial accruals, stock-based compensation, income taxes and, prior to the IPO, fair value of embedded derivative liability, fair value of
convertible preferred stock and fair values of common and convertible preferred stock warrants. The Company&#146;s actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no significant changes from
our original estimates in any periods presented. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Principles of Consolidation</B>&#151;The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary in Australia. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Reclassifications</B>&#151;The Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The Company
reclassified changes in fair value of warrant liabilities from other income (expense), net and presented it as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The reclassification had no impact on the total
income (expense), net or net loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Foreign Currency Translation</B>&#151;The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements are prepared in U.S.
dollars. Its foreign subsidiary uses the Australian dollar as its functional currency and maintains its records in the local currency. Assets and liabilities are re-measured at exchange rates in effect at the end of the reporting period. Equity is
measured at historical rates and income and expenses are re-measured at average exchange rates for the reporting period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the
consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at exchange rates at the date of transaction with foreign currency gains (losses)
recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Cash and Cash
Equivalents</B>&#151;As December&nbsp;31, 2014, cash equivalents were comprised of money market funds. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at fair value. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Deposit</B>&#151;Deposit in the amount of $0.1 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013
represents amounts paid in connection with the Company&#146;s facility lease agreement and recorded as a long-term asset. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Segment
Reporting</B>&#151;The Company operates and manages its business as one reporting and operating segment, which is the business of developing and commercializing gene therapeutics. The Company&#146;s chief executive officer, who is the chief
operating decision maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Concentrations of Credit Risk and Other Uncertainties</B>&#151;Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit
risk consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, substantially all of the Company&#146;s cash and cash equivalents was deposited in accounts at four financial institutions, and amounts may exceed federally insured
limits. Management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the financial instrument are held. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to changes in any of the following areas that the Company believes could
have a material adverse effect on future financial position or results of operations: ability to obtain future financing; regulatory approval and market acceptance of, and reimbursement for, the Company&#146;s product candidates; performance of
third-party clinical research organizations and manufacturers; development of sales channels; protection of the intellectual property; litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property, patent, product, regulatory or other
factors; and the Company&#146;s ability to attract and retain employees necessary to support the growth. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Property and Equipment</B>&#151;Property and
equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are
capitalized and amortized over the shorter period, expected life or lease term. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized, while general repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets</B>&#151;We evaluate the carrying amount of the Company&#146;s long-lived
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is
less than the carrying amount of the asset. To date, there have been no such impairment losses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Deferred Offering Costs</B>&#151;We capitalize
deferred offering costs, which primarily consist of direct incremental legal and accounting fees relating to our public offerings. We offset the deferred offering costs against our public offering proceeds upon the consummation of our public
offerings. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, $0.4 million and $50,000 of deferred offering costs were capitalized in deposits and other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Convertible Preferred Stock</B>&#151;The Company recorded issued convertible preferred stock at fair value on the dates of issuance, net of issuance costs.
The convertible preferred stock was recorded outside of stockholders&#146; deficit because the shares contain liquidation features that are not solely within the Company&#146;s control. All of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock
were converted into common stock shares immediately prior to the completion of the IPO in July 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Derivative Instruments</B>&#151;The Company has
recorded convertible preferred stock warrants issued to investors and note holders as derivative liabilities.&nbsp;The convertible preferred stock warrants are initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair
value recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each period end while such instruments are outstanding and classified as long-term liabilities. In connection with the completion of
the Company&#146;s IPO in August 2014, all of the outstanding warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock were exercised. As a result of the exercises, the Company recorded a $0.8 million loss related to the change in fair value in our
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and reclassified the fair value of $0.9 million to additional paid-in capital. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company
has also recorded as a derivative liability the Company&#146;s obligation to issue common stock warrants in connection with license agreements as the terms of the warrants were not fixed due to potential adjustments in the exercise price. The
derivative liability associated with the common stock warrants was initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each
period end while such instruments are classified as liabilities. In March 2014, the liability terminated upon the issuance of common stock warrant and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Both the preferred stock and common stock warrant liabilities were valued using a Black-Scholes valuation model (refer to Note 10). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO, all outstanding warrants to purchase preferred stock and common stock were exercised, and the outstanding
liability was reversed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Revenue Recognition</B>&#151;The Company has primarily generated contract revenue through a research and collaboration
arrangement with a strategic partner for the development and commercialization of product candidates, and a license agreement related to the licensing of certain of our intellectual property. Additionally, the Company has historically generated
grant revenue from research and development grant programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic

Company entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Regeneron to discover, develop and commercialize novel gene therapy products for the treatment of ophthalmologic diseases. The collaboration covers up to eight distinct
therapeutic targets (collaboration targets). The Company and Regeneron will collaborate during the initial research period of three years that can be extended by Regeneron for up to an additional five years. During the research period, Regeneron has
the option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license for a collaboration target&#146;s further development by giving written notice to the Company and paying $2.0 million per target. If Regeneron exercises its option, it will be responsible for all
further development and commercialization of the target. The Company is then eligible to receive contingent payments of up to $80.0&nbsp;million upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for product candidates directed toward
each collaboration target, for a combined total of up to $640.0 million in potential milestone payments for product candidates directed toward all eight collaboration targets, plus a royalty in the low- to mid-single-digits on worldwide net sales of

or liabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to
the fair value measurement. The Company&#146;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of Level 1 assets has been determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 1 securities consist of highly liquid

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The estimated fair values of the outstanding common and preferred stock warrant liabilities are measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model. This method
of valuation involves using such inputs as the estimated fair value of the underlying stock at the measurement date, the expected term, which is the remaining contractual term of the warrants, risk-free interest rates, expected dividends on stock
and expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock (refer to Note 10). Due to the nature of these inputs, the valuation of the warrants is considered a Level 3 measurement. The convertible preferred stock and common stock warrant
liabilities will increase or decrease each period based on the fluctuations of the fair value of the underlying security. A significant fluctuation in the common or convertible preferred stock fair value would result in a material change in the fair
values of the convertible preferred stock and common stock warrant liabilities. </P>

value using a discount rate of 21% at each measurement date. The embedded derivative liability increases or decreases each period based on the amount of convertible notes outstanding at each measurement date. This liability ceased in November 2013

fair value of this embedded derivative on the date of issuance was determined to be approximately $24,000, and was recorded as a discount to the 2012 Notes. This discount was amortized to interest expense through the maturity date of the 2012 Notes.
The embedded derivative was re-measured each period end with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. In November 2013, the derivative terminated upon the conversion of the 2012 Notes into

purchase 25,000 shares of common stock. The Company estimated the fair value of the obligation to issue this warrant to be approximately $5,000, which was recorded as research and development expense and common stock warrant liability. The fair
value of the obligation was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and was based on the common stock fair value of $0.30 per share, contractual term of the warrants of 5&nbsp;years, a risk-free interest rate of 0.7%, an expected
volatility of 86% and a 0% expected dividend yield. Until the Company issued the warrant, it classified it as a common stock warrant liability and re-measured the fair value at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of this liability was
$42,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2013. In March 2014, the Company issued the common stock warrant to LEI with an exercise price of $2.75 per share, at which time the issued common stock warrant was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. </P>

to be approximately $0.3 million which was recorded as expenses related to issuance of Series B convertible preferred stock. The fair value of the warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and was based on the common stock fair
value of $6.83 per share, contractual term of the warrant of 5 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.55%, an expected volatility of 75% and a 0% expected dividend yield. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;26, 2006, the Company adopted the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended by the board of directors on
November&nbsp;15, 2012 (2006 Plan). The 2006 Plan allowed for the granting of ISOs and NSOs to the employees, members of the board of directors and consultants of the Company. ISOs were granted only to the Company&#146;s employees, including
officers and directors who are also employees. NSOs were granted to the employees and consultants. In July 2014, the Company&#146;s board of directors and its stockholders approved the establishment of the 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan (2014
Plan), effective upon the date upon which the registration statement for the IPO was declared effective, which was July&nbsp;30, 2014. As of the date of the IPO, the Company reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan a total of 2,088,332&nbsp;shares
of its common stock, plus any additional shares that would otherwise return to the 2006 Plan as a result of forfeiture, termination or expiration of awards previously granted under the 2006 Plan. Options may no longer be issued under the 2006 Plan
after July&nbsp;30, 2014, the effective date of the 2014 Plan. In addition, the 2014 Plan provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance thereunder on the first business day of each fiscal year, beginning with 2015,
equal to four percent (4%)&nbsp;of the number of shares of the Company&#146;s common stock outstanding as of such date or a lesser number of shares as determined by the Company&#146;s board of directors. </P>

under the 2014 Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Options under the 2006 Plan and 2014 Plan may be granted for periods of up to 10 years and at prices no less than 100% of the
estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as determined by the board of directors, provided, however, that the exercise price of an ISO and NSO granted to a 10% shareholder may not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the
shares on the date of grant. Options granted to employees and non-employees generally vest ratably over four years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2014, the Company&#146;s

on the Company&#146;s history of operating losses, the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefit of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The valuation allowance increased approximately $9.9 million, $1.4 million and $0.4 million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, due to net
operating losses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $39.6&nbsp;million to offset future
federal income. NOLs expire at various years beginning with 2026. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company also had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of approximately $41.0 million to offset future state income. U.S. State NOLs expire at various years
beginning with 2016. At December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company also had approximately $0.2 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which may be available to offset future foreign income; these carryforwards do not expire. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of certain realization requirements of Accounting Standard Codification Topic 718, <I>Compensation &#150; Stock Compensation </I>(ASC 718), the
table of deferred tax assets and liabilities does not include certain deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 that arose directly from tax deductions related to equity compensation that are greater than the compensation recognized for
financial reporting. Equity will be increased by $7.4 million if and when such deferred tax assets are ultimately realized. We use ASC 740 ordering when determining when excess tax benefits have been realized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $0.5 million available to reduce
future tax liabilities which expire at various years beginning with 2032. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had state credit carryforwards of approximately $0.5 million available to reduce future tax liabilities which do not expire. </P>

experienced an &#147;ownership change.&#148; Generally, a Section&nbsp;382 ownership change occurs if there is a cumulative increase of more than 50 percentage points in the stock ownership of
one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation&#146;s stock within a specified testing period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We believe that we have experienced at least two ownership changes
under Section&nbsp;382, which will result in limitations in our ability to utilize net operating losses and credits. In addition, we may experience ownership changes as a result of our initial public offering in August 2014, future offerings or
other changes in the ownership of our stock. As a result, the amount of the NOLs and research and credit carryforwards presented in our financial statements could be limited and may expire unutilized. </P>

may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Company has total unrecognized tax benefits as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 of approximately $471,000, $43,000 and $5,000 respectively. No amount of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the Company&#146;s annual
effective tax rate because the benefits are in the form of deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded. The Company does not anticipate a significant change to its unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.
A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands): </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>
