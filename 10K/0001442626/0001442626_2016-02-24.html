that forward-looking statements are not guarantees. Actual events or our investments and results of operations could differ materially
from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the use
of terms such as &ldquo;may,&rdquo; &ldquo;should,&rdquo; &ldquo;expect,&rdquo; &ldquo;could,&rdquo; &ldquo;intend,&rdquo; &ldquo;plan,&rdquo;
&ldquo;anticipate,&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate,&rdquo; &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; &ldquo;continue,&rdquo; &ldquo;predict,&rdquo; &ldquo;potential&rdquo;

music and other community-oriented activities to appeal to our residents&rsquo; desire for a &ldquo;sense of community&rdquo; by
creating places to gather, socialize and interact in an amenity-rich environment. We believe this creates an enhanced perception

to register shares of newly authorized Class A common stock that were to be offered in a firmly underwritten public offering (the
&ldquo;IPO&rdquo;) by filing a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-192610) with the SEC, on November 27, 2013. On
March 28, 2014, the SEC declared the registration statement effective and we announced the pricing of the IPO of 3,448,276 shares

each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the listing, including shares sold in our Continuous Registered
Offerings, was changed into one-third of a share of each of Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common

of our board of directors on a quarterly basis. When determining the amount of future distributions, we expect that our board of
directors will consider, among other factors, (i) the amount of cash generated from our operating activities, (ii) our expectations
of future operating cash flows, (iii) our determination of near-term cash needs for acquisitions of new properties, general property
capital improvements and debt repayments, (iv) our ability to continue to access additional sources of capital, (v) the requirements
of Maryland law, (vi) the amount required to be distributed to maintain our status as a REIT and to reduce any income and excise
taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay and (vii) any limitations on our distributions contained in our credit or other

we may be required to fund distributions from working capital, offering proceeds, borrow funds, sell assets, make a taxable distribution
of our equity or debt securities, or reduce such distributions. Our distribution policy enables us to review the alternative funding
sources available to us from time to time. Our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors, including
the revenues we receive from our properties, our operating expenses, interest expense, the ability of our tenants to meet their
obligations and unanticipated expenditures. For more information regarding risk factors that could materially adversely affect

changes in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing apartment properties in an area. If the economic recovery slows or stalls,
these conditions could persist and we could experience downward pressure on occupancy and market rents at our apartment properties,

depend, in large part, on revenues derived from leasing space in our properties. We are subject to the credit risk of our tenants,
and to the extent our tenants default on their leases or fail to make rental payments we may suffer a decrease in our revenue.
In addition, if a tenant does not pay its rent, we may not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and we may
incur substantial legal costs. We are also subject to the risk that we will not be able to lease space in our value-added or opportunistic
properties or that, upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties, leases may not be renewed, the space may
not be re-leased or the terms of renewal or re-leasing (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers)
may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. If vacancies continue for a long period of time, we may suffer reduced revenues
resulting in decreased distributions to our stockholders. In addition, the resale value of the property could be diminished because
the market value of a particular property will depend principally upon the value of the leases of such property. Further, costs
associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced when circumstances
cause a reduction in revenue. These events would cause a significant decrease in revenues and could cause us to reduce the amount

the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Federal Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Emergency Planning and

govern such matters as wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage

we must comply with the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, which requires that apartment properties first occupied after March
13, 1991 be accessible to handicapped residents and visitors. These laws may require us to make modifications to our properties.
Some of these laws and regulations impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate

with these laws and any new or more stringent laws or regulations may require us to incur material expenditures. Future laws, ordinances

Mac are a major source of financing for the apartment real estate sector. We and other apartment companies in the apartment real
estate sector depend frequently on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to finance growth by purchasing or guarantying apartment loans. In
February 2011, the Obama Administration released a report to Congress which included options, among others, to gradually shrink
and eventually shut down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. &nbsp;In June 2013, a bipartisan group of senators proposed an overhaul of
the housing finance system which would wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac within five years; in August 2013, President Obama
announced his support for this legislation. We do not know when or if Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac will restrict their support of
lending to the apartment real estate industry or to us in particular. A final decision by the government to eliminate Fannie Mae
or Freddie Mac, or reduce their acquisitions or guarantees of apartment real estate mortgage loans, may adversely affect interest

owned subsidiaries, primarily in the business of buying real estate, and qualifying real estate investments must be made within
a year after cash is received by us. If we are unable to invest a significant portion of cash proceeds in properties within one

of these subsidiaries will be outside the definition of investment company under Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act
as they are generally expected to hold at least 60% of their assets in real property or in entities that they manage or co-manage
that own real property. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or
holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C)
of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business
of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having
a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer&rsquo;s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items)
on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. Excluded from the term &ldquo;investment securities,&rdquo; among
other things, are U.S. government securities and securities issued by majority owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment
companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section
3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. We believe that we, our operating partnership and most of the subsidiaries of our operating
partnership will not fall within either definition of investment company as we invest primarily in real property, through our wholly
or majority owned subsidiaries, the majority of which we expect to have at least 60% of their assets in real property or in entities
that they manage or co-manage that own real property. As these subsidiaries would be investing either solely or primarily in real
property, they would be outside of the definition of &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; under Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company
Act. We are organized as a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through the operating partnership, which in turn
is a holding company conducting its business through its subsidiaries. Both we and our operating partnership intend to conduct
our operations so that they comply with the 40% test. We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance
with this test. In addition, we believe that neither we nor the operating partnership will be considered an investment company
under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because neither we nor the operating partnership will engage primarily or
hold itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, through
the operating partnership&rsquo;s wholly-owned or majority owned subsidiaries, we and the operating partnership will be primarily
engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these subsidiaries.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 15pt">In the event that the
value of investment securities held by the subsidiaries of our operating partnership were to exceed 40%, we expect our subsidiaries
to be able to rely on the exclusion from the definition of &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the
Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, requires each of our subsidiaries relying on
this exception to invest at least 55% of its portfolio in &ldquo;mortgage and other liens on and interests in real estate,&rdquo;
which we refer to as &ldquo;qualifying real estate assets&rdquo; and maintain at least 70% to 90% of its assets in qualifying real
estate assets or other real estate-related assets. The remaining 20% of the portfolio can consist of miscellaneous assets. What
we buy and sell is therefore limited to these criteria. How we determine to classify our assets for purposes of the Investment
Company Act will be based in large measure upon no-action letters issued by the SEC staff in the past and other SEC interpretive
guidance. These no-action positions were issued in accordance with factual situations that may be substantially different from
the factual situations we may face, and a number of these no-action positions were issued more than ten years ago. Pursuant to
this guidance, and depending on the characteristics of the specific investments, certain joint venture investments may not constitute
qualifying real estate assets and therefore investments in these types of assets may be limited. No assurance can be given that
the SEC will concur with our classification of our assets. Future revisions to the Investment Company Act or further guidance from
the SEC may cause us to lose our exclusion from registration or force us to re-evaluate our portfolio and our investment strategy.
Such changes may prevent us from operating our business successfully.</P>

or our operating partnership, were to acquire assets that could make either entity fall within the definition of investment company
under Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act, we believe that we would still qualify for an exclusion from registration
pursuant to Section 3(c)(6). Section 3(c)(6) excludes from the definition of investment company any company primarily engaged,
directly or through majority owned subsidiaries, in one or more of certain specified businesses. These specified businesses include
the real estate business described in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. It also excludes from the definition of
investment company any company primarily engaged, directly or through majority owned subsidiaries, in one or more of such specified
businesses from which at least 25% of such company&rsquo;s gross income during its last fiscal year is derived, together with any
additional business or businesses other than investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities. Although the SEC
staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to Section 3(c)(6), we believe that we and our operating partnership
may rely on Section 3(c)(6) if 55% of the assets of our operating partnership consist of, and at least 55% of the income of our
operating partnership is derived from, qualifying real estate assets owned by wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries of our
operating partnership.</P>

corporate general and administrative expenses exceeded the cash flow received from our investments in real estate joint ventures.
The primary reason for the previous negative operating cash flow was the amount of our corporate general and administrative expenses
relative to the size of the portfolio. Our corporate general and administrative expenses were $4.1 million for the year ended December
31, 2015, which reflected an increase of $1.4 million over the same period in 2014. During 2015 the size of our portfolio increased
significantly and cash flow from our investments in real estate joint ventures increased to cover our general and administrative
expenses. There can be no assurance that current period operating cash flow will continue to exceed our general and administrative
expenses. If cash flow received from our investments decreases and our corporate general and administrative expenses become high
in relation to the size of our portfolio, this would reduce the amount of funds available for us to invest in properties or other
investments. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to

The method by which we could internalize these functions could take many forms. While we believe that there are substantial benefits
to internalization of management functions at the appropriate time, there is no assurance that internalization will be beneficial
to us and our stockholders, and internalizing our management functions could reduce earnings per share and funds from operation
per share. For example, we may not realize the perceived benefits or we may not be able to properly integrate a new staff of managers
and employees or we may not be able to effectively replicate the services provided previously by our Manager or its affiliates.
Internalization transactions involving the internalization of managers affiliated with entity sponsors have also, in some cases,
been the subject of litigation. Even if these claims are without merit, we could be forced to spend significant amounts of money
defending claims which would reduce the amount of funds available for us to invest in properties or other investments to pay distributions.
All these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions.</P>

would in order to avoid a potential conflict. Our decision to sell such interests will depend, among other things, on our ability
to sell the interests at favorable prices or at all. It is also possible that our Manager or its affiliates, who also manage such
funds, may sell such co-investment assets at times or prices that are not in the best interests of us or our stockholders. In addition,
to the extent that such funds dispose of co-investment assets that are qualifying assets, we may be required to purchase additional
qualifying assets (subject to the availability of capital at favorable prices or at all) or sell non-qualifying assets at inopportune
times or prices in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company
Act. Even if our interests are not in conflict with those of funds with co-investment rights, we will not realize the full economic
benefits of the investment. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our Manager&rsquo;s ability to operate our business in a manner

with real estate programs and activities which are unrelated to us. As a result of these activities, our Manager, its employees
and certain of its affiliates have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between us and other activities in which they
are or may become involved. Our Manager and its employees will devote only as much of their time to our business as our Manager,
in its judgment, determines is reasonably required, which may be substantially less than their full time. Therefore, our Manager
and its employees may experience conflicts of interest in allocating management time, services, and functions among us and other
of our affiliates and any other business ventures in which they or any of their key personnel, as applicable, are or may become
involved. This could result in actions that are more favorable to other of our affiliates than to us. However, our Manager believes
that it and its affiliates have sufficient personnel to discharge fully their responsibilities to all of the activities of our
affiliates in which they are involved.</P>

incentive fee structure may lead our Manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of AFFO at the expense of other criteria,
such as preservation of capital, in order to increase its incentive fee. Investments with higher yields generally have higher risk
of loss than investments with lower yields, and could result in higher investment losses, particularly during cyclical economic

objectives of the various programs and the terms of our investment allocation agreement. After such apportionment, the property
would be owned by two or more programs sponsored by Bluerock or joint ventures composed of programs sponsored by affiliates of

such joint venture partner. In addition, the co-venturer may have economic or business interests or goals that are or may become

nonrecourse loans, we may provide standard carve-out guaranties. These guaranties are only applicable if and when the borrower
directly, or indirectly through agreement with an affiliate, joint venture partner or other third party, voluntarily files a bankruptcy
or similar liquidation or reorganization action or takes other actions that are fraudulent or improper (commonly referred to as
&ldquo;bad boy&rdquo; guaranties). Although we believe that &ldquo;bad boy&rdquo; carve-out guaranties are not guaranties of payment
in the event of foreclosure or other actions of the foreclosing lender that are beyond the borrower&rsquo;s control, some lenders
in the real estate industry have recently sought to make claims for payment under such guaranties. In the event such a claim were
made against us under a &ldquo;bad boy&rdquo; carve-out guaranty following foreclosure on mortgages or related loan, and such claim
were successful, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.</P>

acquisitions using interest-only mortgage indebtedness. During the interest-only period, the amount of each scheduled payment will
be less than that of a traditional amortizing mortgage loan. The principal balance of the mortgage loan will not be reduced (except
in the case of prepayments) because there are no scheduled monthly payments of principal during this period. After the interest-only
period, we will be required either to make scheduled payments of amortized principal and interest or to make a lump-sum or &ldquo;balloon&rdquo;
payment at maturity. These required principal or balloon payments will increase the amount of our scheduled payments and may increase
our risk of default under the related mortgage loan. If the mortgage loan has an adjustable interest rate, the amount of our scheduled
payments also may increase at a time of rising interest rates. Increased payments and substantial principal or balloon maturity
payments will reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders because cash otherwise available for distribution
will be required to pay principal and interest associated with these mortgage loans.</P>

on loans secured by our assets and investments in collateralized mortgage-backed securities. Derivative instruments may include

Our actual hedging decisions will be determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of the hedge and may

use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate fluctuations, we will be exposed to financing, basis risk and
legal enforceability risks. In this context, credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative
contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. Basis
risk occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset
or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. Finally, legal enforceability risks encompass general contractual
risks, including the risk that the counterparty will breach the terms of, or fail to perform its obligations under, the derivative
contract. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make
distributions to you will be adversely affected.</P>

must consist of defined types of income that we derive, directly or indirectly, from investments relating to real property or mortgages
on real property or qualified temporary investment income (the &ldquo;75% Gross Income Test&rdquo;). Second, in general, at least
95% of our gross income for each taxable year must consist of income that is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% Gross Income
Test, other types of interest and dividends, gain from the sale or disposition of shares or securities, or any combination of these

provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge the risks inherent to our operations. From time to time, we may enter into
hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. Our hedging transactions may include entering into
interest rate swaps, caps and floors, options to purchase these items, and futures and forward contracts. Any income or gain derived
by us from transactions that hedge certain risks, such as the risk of changes in interest rates, will not be treated as gross income
for purposes of either the 75% Gross Income Test or the 95% Gross Income Test, unless specific requirements are met. Such requirements
include that the hedging transaction be properly identified within prescribed time periods and that the transaction either (1)
hedges risks associated with indebtedness issued by us that is incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets or (2) manages the
risks of currency fluctuations with respect to income or gain that qualifies under the 75% Gross Income Test or 95% Gross Income
Test (or assets that generate such income). To the extent that we do not properly identify such transactions as hedges, hedge with
other types of financial instruments, or hedge other types of indebtedness, the income from those transactions is not likely to
be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 75% Gross Income Test and the 95% Gross Income Test. As a result of these rules,
we may have to limit the use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous, which could result in greater risks associated
with interest rate or other changes than we would otherwise incur.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 15pt">One of the factors that
investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our Class A common stock is our distribution yield, which is our distribution
rate as a percentage of our share price, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors
may desire a higher distribution yield on our Class A common stock or may seek securities paying higher dividends or interest.
The market price of our Class A common stock likely will be based primarily on the earnings that we derive from rental income with
respect to our investments and our related distributions to stockholders, and not from the underlying appraised value of the properties
themselves. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions are likely to affect the market price of our
Class A common stock, and such effects could be significant. For example, if interest rates rise without an increase in our distribution
rate, the market price of our Class A common stock could decrease because potential investors may require a higher distribution
yield on our Class A common stock as market rates on interest-bearing securities, such as bonds, rise.</P>

While our policy is generally to pay distributions from cash flow from operations, our distributions through December 31, 2015
have been paid from proceeds from our Continuous Registered Offerings conducted prior to the IPO, proceeds from the IPO and the

extent we fund distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, such distributions may constitute a return of capital

as a REIT, the articles supplementary establishing the Series A Preferred Stock prohibit anyone from owning, or being deemed to
own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% in value or number of shares, whichever
is more restrictive, of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. You should consider these ownership limitations prior to a purchase
of the Series A Preferred Stock. The restrictions could also have anti-takeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a
third party will attempt to acquire control of us, which could adversely affect the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock.</P>

receive income from rents at various times during our fiscal year, distributions paid may not reflect our income earned in that

to acquire properties as offering proceeds become available, the income from those investments and yields on securities of other
real estate companies that we invest in, as well as our operating expense levels and many other variables. In addition, to the
extent we make distributions to stockholders with sources other than cash flow from operations, the amount of cash that is available
for investment in real estate assets will be reduced, which will in turn negatively impact our ability to achieve our investment
objectives and limit our ability to make future distributions.</P>

assert that we are subject to the prohibited transaction tax equal to 100% of net gain upon a disposition of real property. Although
a safe harbor to the characterization of the sale of real property by a REIT as a prohibited transaction is available, not all
of our prior property dispositions qualified for the safe harbor and we cannot assure you that we can comply with the safe harbor
in the future or that we have avoided, or will avoid, owning property that may be characterized as held primarily for sale to customers
in the ordinary course of business. Consequently, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of our properties or may conduct
such sales through a TRS, which would be subject to federal and state income taxation. Additionally, in the event that we engage

in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is a variable interest entity (a &ldquo;VIE&rdquo;) and would require consolidation.
A VIE is an entity that has (i) insufficient equity to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support or (ii) equity holders that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. VIEs are consolidated by the
primary beneficiary, which is the entity that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity&rsquo;s
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that potentially
could be significant to the entity. Variable interests in a VIE are contractual, ownership, or other financial interests in a VIE
that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE&rsquo;s net assets. We continuously re-assess whether the managing member
LLC in which we hold an interest is (i) a VIE, and (ii) if we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If it was determined that
the joint venture qualified as a VIE and we were the primary beneficiary, it would be consolidated.</P>

literature, we have determined that VIE accounting is not applicable to the joint ventures, the Company assesses the need for consolidation

voting interest held by the Company provides control, or through determination of control by the Company being the general partner
in a limited partnership or the controlling member of a limited liability company.</P>

deemed to control the entity if any of the other members have either (i) substantive kickout rights providing the ability to dissolve
(liquidate) the entity or otherwise remove the managing member or general partner without cause or (ii) has substantive participating
rights in the entity.&nbsp; Substantive participating rights (whether granted by contract or law) provide for the ability to effectively
participate in significant decisions of the entity that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

of these investments is reflected in our earnings or losses.</P>

as a Maryland corporation on July 25, 2008. Our principal business objective is to maximize returns through investments in Class
A institutional-quality apartment properties in demographically attractive growth markets across the United States where we believe
we can drive substantial growth in our funds from operations and net asset value through one or more of our Core-Plus, Value-Add,
Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies.</P>

our portfolio consisted of interests in twenty properties (fourteen operating and six development properties). The twenty properties
contain an aggregate of 6,449 units, comprised of 4,625 operating units and 1,824 units under development. As of December 31, 2015,
these properties, exclusive of our development properties, and Whetstone, EOS and Sorrell, the lease-up properties, were approximately
93% occupied.</P>

taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust (&ldquo;REIT&rdquo;) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and have qualified as a
REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to
our stockholders each calendar year at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains). If we qualify as a REIT for
federal income tax purposes, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders.
If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular
corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify as a REIT for four years following the year in which our qualification is
denied. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and results of operations. We intend to continue to
organize and operate in such a manner as to remain qualified as a REIT.</P>

our Continuous Registered Offerings, carried out in a manner consistent with offerings of non-listed REITs, from our inception
until September 9, 2013, when we terminated the Continuous Registered Offerings in connection with the board of directors&rsquo;
consideration of strategic alternatives to maximize value to our stockholders. Through September 9, 2013, we had raised an aggregate

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 15pt">We subsequently determined
to register shares of newly authorized Class A common stock that were to be offered in a firmly underwritten public offering (the
&ldquo;IPO&rdquo;), by filing a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-192610) with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;), on November 27, 2013. On March 28, 2014, the SEC declared the registration statement effective and we announced
the pricing of the IPO of 3,448,276 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $14.50 per share for total gross
proceeds of $50.0 million. The net proceeds of the IPO were approximately $44.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering costs.</P>

the second articles of amendment and restatement to our charter filed on March 26, 2014 (the &ldquo;Second Charter Amendment&rdquo;),
each share of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the listing, including shares sold in our Continued Registered
Offerings, was changed into one-third of a share of each of Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common
stock. Following the filing of the Second Charter Amendment, we effected a 2.264881-to-1 reverse stock split of our outstanding
shares of Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common stock, and on March 31, 2014, we effected an additional
1.0045878-to-1 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common
stock.</P>

with the completion of the IPO, we completed a series of related contribution transactions pursuant to which we acquired indirect
equity interests in four apartment properties, and a 100% fee simple interest in a fifth apartment property for an aggregate asset
value of $152.3 million (inclusive of Oak Crest, which is accounted for under the equity method, and Springhouse, in which we already
owned an interest and which has been reported as consolidated for the periods presented).</P>

within a 774-unit condominium property known as Lansbrook Village located in Palm Harbor, Florida, or the Lansbrook property. As
further consideration for the Lansbrook acquisition, we were required to provide certain standard scope non-recourse carveout guarantees
(and related hazardous materials indemnity agreements) related to approximately $42.0 million of indebtedness encumbering the Lansbrook
property through a joinder to the loan agreement. The purchase price paid for the acquired interest was based on the amounts capitalized
by Fund II and Fund III in the Lansbrook property plus an 8% annualized return for the period they held their respective interests
in BR Lansbrook JV Member. The approximate dollar value attributed to Mr. Kamfar, as a result of his indirect ownership of Bluerock,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 15pt">We believe that &nbsp;a
significant amount of institutional capital and public REITs are primarily focused on investing in the &ldquo;big six gateway
markets&rdquo; of Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, and that many other primary markets
are underinvested by institutional/public capital. As a result, we believe that the top 40 primary markets below the gateway markets,
including our target markets, provide the opportunity to source investments at cap rates that are at significant premiums to the
gateway markets, and have the potential to provide not only significant current income, but also attractive capital appreciation.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 15pt">&nbsp;We additionally
believe that a number of its target growth markets are underserved by newer Class A apartment properties, especially as the wave
of Millennials moves into its prime rental years over the upcoming decade. As such, we believe there is opportunity in certain
of our target markets for development and/or redevelopment to deliver Class A product and capture premium rental rates and value
growth.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 15pt">As financial buyers
who entered the market following the recent U.S. recession to take advantage of historical spreads between higher acquisition
cap rates and lower, long-term financing interest rates enter their disposition periods, we believe the next phase of the cycle
provides opportunity for real estate-centric buyers (i.e., buyers who have real estate-specific investment expertise and deep
intellectual capital in specific markets), to create value using proven real estate investment strategies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">As the economy continues
its recovery and enters an environment of more traditional (i.e., higher) interest rate levels, we believe private purchasers
with greater capital constraints who have needed significant leverage to fund acquisitions will become less competitive, which
would provide the opportunity to acquire apartment communities from owners who do not have sufficient capital resources to execute
their business plans.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 15pt; text-align: justify">We further believe that demographic forces
indicate strong growth for apartment demand in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, including demand from the growing
Millennial population which has a high propensity to rent, the large pent-up demand from young adults that have been living at
home or with roommates, increasing share of the rental sector vs. homeownership, the declining homeownership rate due to affordability
issues, and negative sentiments toward home ownership following the housing crisis experienced during the Great Recession.</P>

5.6% increase in same store property revenues as compared to the 2014 period, primarily attributable to a 3.3% increase in average
rental rates, the acquisition of 22 additional units at our Enders property in April 2014, the acquisition of 29 additional units
at our Lansbrook property (15 units in 2014 and 14 units in 2015) and a 120 basis point increase in average occupancy. Same stores

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 25pt">We believe that net
operating income, or NOI, is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define NOI as total property revenues less total
property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and interest. Other REITs may use different methodologies
for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 25pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 25pt">We believe that this
measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income. We use NOI to evaluate
our performance on a same store and non-same store basis because NOI allows us to evaluate the operating performance of our properties
because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related
to property operating performance and captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 25pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 25pt">However, NOI should
only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. The following table reflects same store and non-same store
contributions to consolidated NOI, together with a reconciliation of NOI to net loss, as computed in accordance with GAAP for the
periods presented (amounts in thousands):</P>

Prior to our IPO, our cash resources had been inadequate to meet our primary liquidity needs as our corporate operating expenses
exceeded the cash flow received from our investments in real estate joint ventures. The primary reason for our previous negative
operating cash flow had been the amount of our general and administrative expenses, including accounting and related fees to our
independent auditors, legal fees, costs of being an SEC reporting company, director compensation and director and officer insurance
premiums, relative to the size of our portfolio.&nbsp;</P>

our IPO, and our Follow-On Offerings provided us with the ability to grow our asset base quickly and better service our general
and administrative expenses. In addition, the post-IPO Management Agreement with our Manager provides an overall lower fee structure
than our previous advisory agreement with our Former Advisor, which reduced our corporate general and administrative expenses relative
to the size of the portfolio.</P>

our available cash balances, the proceeds from the Follow-On Offerings, other financing arrangements and cash flows from operations
will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements with respect to our existing portfolio for the next 12 months. We expect
that the additional properties added to our portfolio in the contribution transactions at the initial closing of the IPO, and properties
added to our portfolio with the proceeds from the Follow-On Offerings, and the properties we expect to acquire with the remaining
proceeds from our October 2015 Follow-On Offering, will have a significant positive impact on our future results of operations.
In general, we expect that our results related to our portfolio will improve in future periods as a result of anticipated future
investments in and acquisitions of real estate, including our investments in development projects.</P>

to use prudent amounts of leverage in making our investments, which we define as having total indebtedness of approximately 65%
of the fair market value of the properties in which we have invested as determined by our Manager. For purposes of calculating
our leverage, we assume full consolidation of all of our real estate investments, whether or not they would be consolidated under
GAAP, include assets we have classified as held for sale, and include any joint venture level indebtedness in our total indebtedness.
However, we are not subject to any limitations on the amount of leverage we may use, and accordingly, the amount of leverage we
use may be significantly less or greater than we currently anticipate. We expect our leverage to decline commensurately as we execute
our business plan to grow our net asset value.</P>

help finance our business activities. On October 2, 2012, we entered into the Fund LOC pursuant to which we were initially entitled

to and developments of, real properties, which could limit our growth prospects. This, in turn, could reduce cash available for
distribution to our stockholders and may hinder our ability to raise capital by issuing more securities or borrowing more money.
We also may be forced to dispose of assets at inopportune times in order to maintain our REIT qualification and Investment Company
Act exemption.</P>

the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, our Former Advisor deferred payment by us as needed of asset management fees, acquisition
fees and organizational and offering costs incurred by us. Effective on September 4, 2015, the Former Advisor and Manager entered
into an Assignment Agreement pursuant to which the Former Advisor assigned its right to payment of the obligation due to the Former
Advisor to the Manager. The Manager agreed to receive payment entirely in LTIP Units of the Operating Partnership, and payment
was made through the issuance of 108,119 LTIP Units by the Operating Partnership on September 14, 2015.</P>

the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, our Manager waived current year reimbursable operating expenses, to support our continued
operations. Operating expense reimbursements of $0.1 million were expensed during the three months ended September 30, 2015, were
reimbursed in cash and are recorded as part of general and administrative expenses. Operating expense reimbursements of $0.1 million
were expensed during the three months ended December 31, 2015, which will be paid through the issuance of approximately 11,728
LTIP Units assuming the $11.85 common stock price at December 31, 2015.</P>

a distribution paid on a monthly basis to all of our stockholders at a quarterly rate of $0.29 per share. To the extent we continue
to pay distributions at this rate, we expect to substantially use cash flows from operations to fund distribution payments. The
board of directors will review the distribution rate quarterly, and there can be no assurance that the current distribution level
will be maintained. While our policy is generally to pay distributions from cash flows from operations, our distributions through
December 31, 2015 have been paid from proceeds from our Continuous Registered Offerings, proceeds from the IPO and Follow-On Offerings,
sales of assets, and cash flows from operations and may in the future be paid from additional sources, such as from borrowings.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Funds from
operations attributable to common stockholders (&ldquo;FFO&rdquo;), is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized
as a measure of REIT operating performance.&nbsp;We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating
performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as
depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of
buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real
estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using
historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. We define FFO, consistent with the National Association of
Real Estate Investment Trusts, or (&ldquo;NAREIT's&rdquo;), definition, as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP,
excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus
impairments write-downs of depreciable real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">In addition to
FFO, we use adjusted funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (&ldquo;AFFO&rdquo;). AFFO is a computation
made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company's operating performance by removing the effect of items that
do not reflect ongoing property operations. In computing AFFO, we further adjust FFO by adding back certain items that are
not added to net income in NAREIT's definition of FFO, such as acquisition expenses, equity based compensation expenses, and
any other non-recurring or non-cash expenses, which are costs that do not relate to the operating performance of our
properties, and subtracting recurring capital expenditures (and when calculating the quarterly incentive fee payable to our
Manager only, we further adjust FFO to include any realized gains or losses on our real estate investments).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">During the year ended
December 31, 2015 we incurred $3.3 million of acquisition expense and $1.2 million of disposition expense, of which $3.7 million
was our pro-rata share of the expense.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp; <B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Our calculation of
AFFO differs from the methodology used for calculating AFFO by certain other REITs and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable
to AFFO reported by other REITs. Our management utilizes FFO and AFFO as measures of our operating performance after adjustment
for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization expenses, and acquisition expenses and pursuit costs that are
required by GAAP to be expensed but may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance and that may not accurately
compare our operating performance between periods. Furthermore, although FFO, AFFO and other supplemental performance measures
are defined in various ways throughout the REIT industry, we also believe that FFO and AFFO may provide us and our stockholders
with an additional useful measure to compare our financial performance to certain other REITs. We also use AFFO for purposes of
determining the quarterly incentive fee, if any, payable to our Manager.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Neither FFO nor AFFO
is equivalent to net income or cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, FFO and
AFFO do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion,
debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Neither FFO nor AFFO should be considered as an alternative to
net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure
of our liquidity.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Upon the acquisition
of real estate properties, we recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest as of the
acquisition date, measured at their fair values. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period incurred. We assess the acquisition-date
fair values of all tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities using methods similar to those used
by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis) and that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates
and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating
results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property
considers the value of the property as if it was vacant.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Intangible assets
include the value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated value of the net cash flows of the in-place leases to be realized,
as compared to the net cash flows that would have occurred had the property been vacant at the time of acquisition and subject
to lease-up. We amortize the value of in-place leases to expense over six months. Should a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized
portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense in that period.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Estimates of the fair
values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities require us to make significant assumptions
to estimate market lease rates, property-operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption
periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of inappropriate assumptions could result in
an incorrect valuation of acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities, which could impact
the amount of our net income (loss).</P>

policies are more fully described in Note 2, &ldquo;Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&rdquo;
to our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates
and judgments regarding uncertainties that may affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in our consolidated financial
statements. These estimates and judgments are affected by management&rsquo;s application of accounting policies. These judgments
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.</P>

on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results reported
may differ from these estimates under different situations or conditions. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates
that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We consider an accounting
estimate to be significant if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was
made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.</P>

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, requires our directors and executive officers, and any persons beneficially
owning more than 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock, to file with the SEC reports with respect to their initial ownership
of our common stock and reports of changes in their ownership of our common stock. As a matter of practice, our administrative
staff and outside counsel assists our directors and executive officers in preparing these reports, and typically file those reports
on behalf of our directors and executive officers. Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms filed with the SEC during
fiscal year 2015 and on written representations from our directors and executive officers, we believe that during fiscal year 2015,
except for two Form 4s by R. Ramin Kamfar, one Form 4 by Gary Kachadurian, one Form 4 by Romano Tio, one Form 4 by I. Bobby Majumder
and one Form 4 by Brian D. Bailey, all of our directors and executive officers filed the required reports on a timely basis under

&ldquo;beneficial ownership&rdquo; of a security to mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of voting power and/or investment
power over such security. A stockholder is also deemed to be, as of any date, the beneficial owner of all securities that such
stockholder has the right to acquire within 60 days after that date through (1) the exercise of any option, warrant or right, (2)
the conversion of a security, (3) the power to revoke a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement or (4) the automatic
termination of a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a
person and the percentage ownership of that person, our shares of common stock subject to options, vesting or other rights (as
set forth above) held by that person that are exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days thereafter, are deemed outstanding,

companies or received or earned any compensation from us or any such other entities except for compensation directly related to

may retain, at our sole cost and expense, the services of such persons and firms as the Manager deems necessary in
connection with our management and operations (including accountants, legal counsel and other professional service
providers), provided that such expenses are in amounts no greater than those that would be payable to third-party
professionals or consultants engaged to perform such services pursuant to agreements negotiated on an arm&rsquo;s-length

transaction based legal services, if the Manager determines that such retention would be less expensive than retaining third

                                         all costs and expenses they incurred in connection with their provision of services to
                                         us, including our allocable share of our former advisor&rsquo;s overhead, such as rent,
                                         employee costs, utilities and information technology costs. We did not, however, reimburse
                                         our former advisor for personnel costs in connection with services for which our former
                                         advisor received acquisition, asset management or disposition fees or for personnel costs
                                         related to the salaries of our executive officers. Our charter in effect prior to March
                                         26, 2014 limited our total operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal
                                         quarters to the greater of (A) 2% of our average invested assets, or (B) 25% of our net

                                         bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves and (2) excluding any gain from the sale
                                         of our assets for the period. Notwithstanding the above limitation, we could reimburse
                                         amounts in excess of the limitation if a majority of our independent directors determines
                                         that such excess amounts were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. Due

                                         us have exceeded the 2% threshold, our board of directors, including all of our independent

                                         and 2013 and unanimously determined the excess amounts to be justified because of the
                                         costs of operating a public company in our early stages of operating. As the board of
                                         directors had previously approved such expenses, all operating expenses for the years
                                         ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were expensed as incurred.</TD></TR></TABLE>

cost included the amount expended by us for the development, construction or improvement, and (B) the value of an asset was the
value established by the most recent independent valuation report, if available, without reduction for depreciation, bad debts
or other non-cash reserves. The asset management fee was based only on the portion of the cost or value attributable to our investment
in an asset if we did not own all of an asset. In addition, we paid an oversight fee equal to 1% of monthly gross revenues for
properties for which we contracted property management services to non-affiliated third parties. Asset management and oversight
fees totaled approximately $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and were expensed when incurred. There were no asset

The purchase price of a property or investment was equal to the amount paid or allocated to the purchase, development, construction
or improvement of a property, inclusive of expenses related thereto, and the amount of debt associated with such real property
or investment. The purchase price allocable for joint venture investments was equal to the product of (1) the purchase price of

provided a substantial amount of services as determined by our independent directors, which disposition fee was equal to 1.5%
of the total consideration stated in an agreement for the sale of such property or investment. The disposition fee was to be paid
in addition to real estate commissions paid to non-affiliates, provided that the total real estate commissions (including such
disposition fee) paid by us to all parties for the sale of each property or investment was not to exceed 6.0% of the total consideration

&nbsp;We previously issued 1,000 shares of convertible stock, par value $0.01 per share, to our former advisor. Pursuant to the
initial advisory agreement, upon completion of our IPO, the convertible stock was convertible to shares of common stock if and
when: (A) we had made total distributions on the then outstanding shares of our common stock equal to the original issue price
of those shares plus an 8% cumulative, non-compounded, annual return on the original issue price of those shares or (B) subject
to specified conditions, we listed our common stock for trading on a national securities exchange. We listed shares of our Class
A common stock on the NYSE MKT on March 28, 2014. At that time, the terms for converting the convertible stock would not be achieved
and we amended our charter on March 26, 2014 to remove the convertible stock as an authorized class of our capital stock.</P>

internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&rsquo;s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.</FONT></P>

REIT, Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated as a Maryland corporation&nbsp;on July 25, 2008. The Company&rsquo;s objective
is to maximize long-term stockholder value by acquiring well-located institutional-quality apartment properties in demographically
attractive growth markets across the United States. The Company seeks to maximize returns through investments where it believes
it can drive substantial growth in its funds from operations and net asset value through one or more of its Core-Plus, Value-Add,
Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The Company has elected
to be treated, and currently qualifies, as a real estate investment trust, (&ldquo;REIT&rdquo;), for federal income tax purposes.
As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to corporate-level income taxes. To maintain its REIT status, the Company is required,
among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90% of its &ldquo;REIT taxable income,&rdquo; as defined by the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;), to the Company&rsquo;s stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify
as a REIT in any taxable year, it would be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.</P>

in a continuous registered offering, carried out in a manner consistent with offerings of non-listed REITs, from its inception
until September 9, 2013, when it terminated the continuous registered offering in connection with the Company&rsquo;s Board of
Directors (the &ldquo;Board&rsquo;s&rdquo;) consideration of strategic alternatives to maximize value to its stockholders. The
Company subsequently determined to register shares of newly authorized Class A common stock that were to be offered in a firmly
underwritten public offering, (the &ldquo;IPO&rdquo;), by filing a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-192610) with
the SEC, on November 27, 2013. On March 28, 2014, the SEC declared the registration statement effective and the Company announced
the pricing of the IPO of 3,448,276 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $14.50 per share for total gross
proceeds of $50.0 million. The net proceeds of the IPO, which closed on April 2, 2014, were approximately $44.0 million after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.</P>

shares of the Company&rsquo;s Class A common stock were listed on the NYSE MKT for trading under the symbol &ldquo;BRG.&rdquo;
Pursuant to the second articles of amendment and restatement to its charter filed on March 26, 2014, (the &ldquo;Second Charter
Amendment&rdquo;), each share of its common stock outstanding immediately prior to the listing, including shares sold in its continuous
registered offering, was changed into one-third of a share of each of Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class
B-3 common stock. Following the filing of the Second Charter Amendment, the Company effected a 2.264881-to-1 reverse stock split
of its outstanding shares of Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common stock, and on March 31, 2014,
the Company effected an additional 1.0045878-to-1 reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of Class B-1 common stock, Class
B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common stock.</P>

indirect equity interests in four apartment properties, and a 100% fee simple interest in a fifth apartment property for an aggregate
asset value of $152.3 million (inclusive of Villas at Oak Crest, which is accounted for under the equity method, and Springhouse,
in which the Company already owned an interest and which has been reported as consolidated prior to the IPO).</P>

SEC on September 16, 2014. On October 2, 2014, the SEC declared the Registration Statement effective and the Company announced
the pricing of the October 2014 Follow-On Offering at a public offering price of $11.90 per share. The Company closed the October
2014 Follow-On Offering of 3,035,444 shares of Class A common stock, inclusive of shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of

an umbrella partnership REIT in which Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P. (its &ldquo;Operating Partnership&rdquo;), or its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, owns substantially all of the property interests acquired on the Company&rsquo;s behalf. As of December 31, 2015,
limited partners other than the Company owned approximately 5.95% of the Operating Partnership (1.47% is held by holders of limited
partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (&ldquo;OP Units&rdquo;) and 4.48% is held by holders of the Operating Partnership&rsquo;s
long-term incentive plan units (&ldquo;LTIP Units&rdquo;)). Bluerock Real Estate, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company,
is referred to as Bluerock (&ldquo;Bluerock&rdquo;), and the Company&rsquo;s external manager, BRG Manager, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, is referred to as its Manager (&ldquo;Manager&rdquo;). Both Bluerock and the Manager are related parties with

the sole general partner of its Operating Partnership and has unilateral control over its management and major operating decisions
(even if additional limited partners are admitted to the Operating Partnership), the accounts of the Operating Partnership are
consolidated in its consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns more than 50% of the
voting equity and in which control does not rest with other investors. Investments in real estate joint ventures over which the
Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but for which it does not have financial or operating control, are accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. These entities are reflected on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements
as &ldquo;Investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.&rdquo; All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.&nbsp; The Company will consider future joint ventures for consolidation

its investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is a variable interest entity (&ldquo;VIE&rdquo;) in accordance
with ASC 810 and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation. &nbsp;A VIE is an entity that has
(i) insufficient equity to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or (ii) equity
holders that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest.&nbsp; VIEs are consolidated by the primary beneficiary,
which is the entity that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity&rsquo;s economic
performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that potentially could be significant
to the entity.&nbsp; Variable interests in a VIE are contractual, ownership, or other financial interests in a VIE that change
with changes in the fair value of the VIE&rsquo;s net assets. The Company continuously re-assesses at each level of the joint&nbsp;venture
whether the entity is (i) a VIE, and (ii) if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.&nbsp; If it was determined an entity
in which the Company holds a joint venture interest qualified as a VIE and the Company was the primary beneficiary, the entity
would be consolidated.&nbsp;</P>

of the VIE accounting literature, the Company has determined that VIE accounting is not applicable to the joint ventures, the Company
assesses the need for consolidation under all other provisions of ASC 810.&nbsp; These provisions provide for consolidation of

by virtue of the Company being the general partner in a limited partnership or the controlling member of a limited liability company.</P>

Company is in control of and requiring consolidation of the limited liability company and partnership venture structures the Company
evaluates the respective rights and privileges afforded each member or partner (collectively referred to as &ldquo;member&rdquo;).&nbsp;
The Company&rsquo;s member would not be deemed to control the entity if any of the other members have either (i) substantive kickout
rights providing the ability to dissolve (liquidate) the entity or otherwise remove the managing member or general partner without
cause or (ii) has substantive participating rights in the entity.&nbsp; Substantive participating rights (whether granted by contract
or law) provide for the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions of the entity that would be expected to be
made in the ordinary course business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

that the Company does not have control, but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity, the Company
accounts for these unconsolidated investments under the equity method of accounting.&nbsp;The equity method of accounting requires
these investments to be initially recorded at cost and subsequently increased (decreased) for the Company&rsquo;s share of net
income (loss), including eliminations for the Company&rsquo;s share of inter-company transactions, and increased (decreased) for
contributions (distributions). The Company&rsquo;s proportionate share of the results of operations of these investments is reflected
in the Company&rsquo;s earnings or losses.</P>

to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and has qualified since
the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.&nbsp; To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet certain organizational and operational
requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of its annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed
without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated
in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent it distributes
qualifying dividends to its stockholders.&nbsp; Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject
to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.&nbsp;
If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable
income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue
Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s
net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, the Company intends to continue to organize and operate
in such a manner as to remain qualified for treatment as a REIT.</P>

the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise&rsquo;s financial statements. It requires a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in an income
tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Management has considered all positions taken on the 2009 through 2014 tax returns
(where applicable), and those positions expected to be taken on the 2015 tax returns, and concluded that tax positions taken will
more likely than not be sustained at the full amount upon examination. Accordingly, the Company has concluded that there are no
significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in its consolidated financial statements.&nbsp; The Company expects no
significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits due to changes in tax positions within one year of December 31,
2015. If any income tax exposure was identified, the Company would recognize an estimated liability for income tax items that meet
the criteria for accrual. Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have been assessed interest or penalties by any major tax jurisdictions.
If any interest and penalties related to income tax assessments arose, the Company would record them as income tax expense. As
of December 31, 2015, tax returns for the calendar years 2010 and subsequent remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue
Service and various state tax jurisdictions.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The Company&rsquo;s real
estate assets are leased to tenants under operating leases for which the terms and expirations vary.&nbsp; The leases may have
provisions to extend the lease agreements, options for early termination after paying a specified penalty and other terms and conditions
as negotiated.&nbsp; The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the consolidated real estate
assets leased to tenants.&nbsp; Generally, upon the execution of a lease, the Company requires security deposits from tenants in
the form of a cash deposit.&nbsp; Amounts required as a security deposit vary depending upon the terms of the respective leases
and the creditworthiness of the tenant, but generally are not individually significant amounts.&nbsp; Therefore, exposure to credit
risk exists to the extent that a receivable from a tenant exceeds the amount of their security deposit.&nbsp; Security deposits
received in cash related to tenant leases are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
totaled $1.3 million and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for the Company&rsquo;s consolidated real
estate properties.&nbsp; Tenant security deposits related to North Park Towers totaled $0.1 million for the year ended December
31, 2014, and are included in liabilities associated with operating real estate held for sale in the accompanying 2014 consolidated
balance sheet. No individual tenant represents over 10% of the Company&rsquo;s annualized base rent for the consolidated real estate
properties.</P>

which is approximately six months. Amortization expense related to the in-place leases was $3.8 million and $4.5 million for the
years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">As of December 31, 2015,
the Company had outstanding preferred equity investments in eight multi-tiered joint ventures, each of which were created to develop
a multifamily property. In each case, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the operating partnership made a preferred investment in a
joint venture. The common interests in these joint ventures, as well as preferred interests in some cases, are owned by affiliates
of the Manager. In each case, the Company&rsquo;s investment in the joint venture generates a preferred return of 15% on its outstanding
capital contributions and the Company is not allocated any of the income or loss in the joint ventures. The joint venture then
becomes the controlling member in an entity whose purpose is to develop a multifamily property. Each joint venture is required
to redeem the Company&rsquo;s preferred membership interests plus any accrued but unpaid preferred return on the earlier of the
date which is six months following the maturity of the related development&rsquo;s construction loan. Additionally, the Company
has the right, in its sole discretion, to convert its preferred membership interest in each joint venture into a common membership
interest for a period of six months from the date upon which 70% of the units in the related development have been leased.</P>

(1) the product of (x) 20% and (y) the difference between (i) the Company&rsquo;s adjusted funds from operations (&ldquo;AFFO&rdquo;),
for the previous 12-month period, and (ii) the product of (A) the weighted average of the issue price of equity securities issued
in the IPO and in future offerings and transactions, multiplied by the weighted average number of all shares of the Company&rsquo;s
Class A common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (including any restricted stock units, any restricted shares of Class
A common stock, LTIP Units, and other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the Incentive Plans and OP Units)
in the previous 12-month period, exclusive of equity securities issued prior to the IPO or in the contribution transactions, and
(B) 8%, and (2) the sum of any incentive fee paid to the Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous
12-month period; provided, however, that no incentive fee is payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless AFFO is greater
than zero for the four most recently completed calendar quarters, or the number of completed calendar quarters since the closing
date of the IPO, whichever is less. For purposes of calculating the incentive fee during the first 12 months after completion of
the IPO, AFFO will be determined by annualizing the applicable period following completion of the IPO. One half of each quarterly
installment of the incentive fee will be payable in LTIP Units, calculated pursuant to the formula above. The remainder of the
incentive fee will be payable in cash or in LTIP Units, at the election of the Board, in each case calculated pursuant to the formula
above. Incentive fees of $0.15 million were expensed during the three months ended December 31, 2014, which resulted in the issuance
of 10,896 LTIP Units on February 18, 2015. Incentive fees to the Manager of $0.9 million were expensed during the three months
ended March 31, 2015, which resulted in the issuance of 67,837 LTIP Units on May 14, 2015. No incentive fees to the Manager were
earned or expensed during the nine months ended December 31, 2015.</P>

The LTIP Units may be convertible into OP Units under certain conditions and then may be settled in shares of the Company&rsquo;s
Class A common stock. The LTIP Units provide for the payment of distribution equivalents at the same time distributions are paid
to holders of the Company&rsquo;s Class A common stock. LTIP expense of $1.0 million was recorded as part of general and administrative
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, related to these LTIP Units. The expense recognized during 2015 was

affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Company&rsquo;s independent directors, based upon (1) unsatisfactory performance
that is materially detrimental to the Company, or (2) the Company&rsquo;s determination that the fees payable to the Manager are
not fair, subject to the Manager&rsquo;s right to prevent such termination due to unfair fees by accepting a reduction of the fees
agreed to by at least two-thirds of the Company&rsquo;s independent directors. The Company must provide 180 days&rsquo; prior notice
of any such termination. Unless terminated for cause, as further described in the Management Agreement, the Manager will be paid
a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the base management fee and incentive fee earned, in each case, by the Manager
during the 12-month period immediately preceding such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal

the Company into the Management Agreement upon the completion of the IPO and the concurrent termination of the Advisory Agreement,
the Former Advisor performed essentially the same duties and responsibilities as the Company&rsquo;s new Manager. The Advisory

periods upon the mutual consent of the Company and its Advisor.</P>

(A) cost equals the amount actually paid, excluding acquisition fees and expenses, to purchase each asset it acquires, including
any debt attributable to the asset (including any debt encumbering the asset after acquisition), provided that, with respect to
any properties the Company develops, constructs or improves, cost will include the amount expended by the Company for the development,
construction or improvement, and (B) the value of an asset is the value established by the most recent independent valuation report,
if available, without reduction for depreciation, bad debts or other non-cash reserves.&nbsp; The asset management fee was based
only on the portion of the cost or value attributable to our investment in an asset if the Company did not own all of an asset.</P>

the purchase, development, construction or improvement of a property, inclusive of expenses related thereto, and the amount of
debt associated with such real property or investment. The purchase price allocable for joint venture investments was equal to
the product of (1) the purchase price of the underlying property and (2) the Company&rsquo;s ownership percentage in the joint
venture. Total acquisition and disposition expenses of $5.7 million were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, of which

was entitled to re-allow some, or all, of this fee to reimburse third parties with whom it subcontracted to procure such financing
for the Company. On October 21, 2013, the Company amended its Advisory Agreement to decrease the financing fee from 1.0% to 0.25%
of any loan made to the Company. In addition, to the extent the Former Advisor provided a substantial amount of services in connection
with the disposition of one or more of our properties or investments (except for securities traded on a national securities exchange),
the Former Advisor would receive fees equal to the lesser of (A)&nbsp;1.5% of the sales price of each property or other investment
sold or (B) 50% of the selling commission that would have been paid to a third-party broker in connection with such a disposition.
In no event were disposition fees paid to the Former Advisor or its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties to exceed, in the
aggregate, 6% of the contract sales price. On October 21, 2013, the Company amended its Advisory Agreement to change the disposition
fee to&nbsp;only 1.5% of the sales price of each property or other investment sold, such that the disposition fee&nbsp;was no longer&nbsp;determined
based on selling commissions payable to third-party sales brokers.</P>

total operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters to exceed the greater of 2% of our average invested assets
or 25% of its net income determined (1) without reductions for any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debts or other similar
non-cash reserves and (2) excluding any gain from the sale of our assets for the period.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the above, the Company
was permitted to reimburse amounts in excess of the limitation if a majority of its independent directors determined such excess
amount was justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. If such excess expenses were not approved by a majority of the
Company&rsquo;s independent directors, the Former Advisor was required to reimburse us at the end of the four fiscal quarters the
amount by which the aggregate expenses during the period paid or incurred by us exceeded the limitations provided above.&nbsp;
The Company was not permitted to reimburse the Former Advisor for personnel costs in connection with services for which the Former
Advisor received acquisition, asset management or disposition fees.&nbsp; Due to the limitation discussed above and because operating
expenses incurred directly by the Company exceeded the 2% threshold, the Board, including all of its independent directors, reviewed
the total operating expenses for the four fiscal quarters ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and the Company&rsquo;s total operating
expenses for the four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2014 and unanimously determined the excess amounts to be justified because
of the costs of operating a public company in its early stage of operation and the Company&rsquo;s initial difficulties with raising
capital were considered to be non-recurring in nature.&nbsp; As the Board has previously approved such expenses, all operating
expenses for the year ended 2013 and the three months ended March 31, 2014 have been expensed as incurred.</P>

then outstanding shares of its common stock equal to the original issue price of those shares plus an 8% cumulative, non-compounded,
annual return on the original issue price of those shares or (B) subject to specified conditions, the Company listed its common
stock for trading on a national securities exchange. The Company listed shares of its Class A common stock on the NYSE MKT on March
28, 2014. At that time, the terms for converting the convertible stock would not be achieved and so the Company amended its charter

with the completion of the IPO, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of its
Operating Partnership, Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P. Pursuant to the amendment, the Company is the sole general partner of
the Operating Partnership and may not be removed as general partner by the limited partners with or without cause. The limited
partners of the Operating Partnership include Bluerock REIT Holdings, LLC, BR-NPT Springing Entity, LLC (&ldquo;NPT&rdquo;), Bluerock
Property Management, LLC (&ldquo;BPM&rdquo;), our Manager and Bluerock Multifamily Advisor, LLC (&ldquo;Former Advisor&rdquo;),

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Prior to the completion
of the IPO, the Company owned, directly and indirectly, 100% of the limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership. Effective
as of the completion of the IPO, limited partners other than the Company owned approximately 9.87% of the Operating Partnership
(282,759 OP Units, or 4.59%, were held by OP Unit holders, and 325,578 LTIP Units, or 5.28%, were held by LTIP Unit holders.) As
of December 31, 2015, limited partners other than the Company owned approximately 5.95% of the Operating Partnership (305,568 OP
Units, or 1.47%, is held by OP Unit holders, and 932,394 LTIP Units, or 4.48%, is held by LTIP Unit holders.)</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The Partnership Agreement,
as amended, provides, among other things, that the Operating Partnership initially has two classes of limited partnership interests,
which are units of limited partnership interest (&ldquo;OP Units&rdquo;), and the Operating Partnership&rsquo;s long-term incentive
plan units (&ldquo;LTIP Units&rdquo;). In calculating the percentage interests of the partners in the Operating Partnership, LTIP
Units are treated as OP Units. In general, LTIP Units will receive the same per-unit distributions as the OP Units. Initially,
each LTIP Unit will have a capital account balance of zero and, therefore, will not have full parity with OP Units with respect
to any liquidating distributions. However, the Partnership Agreement, as amended provides that &ldquo;book gain,&rdquo; or economic
appreciation, in the Company&rsquo;s assets realized by the Operating Partnership as a result of the actual sale of all or substantially
all of the Operating Partnership&rsquo;s assets, or the revaluation of the Operating Partnership&rsquo;s assets as provided by
applicable U.S. Department of Treasury regulations, will be allocated first to the holders of LTIP Units until their capital account
per unit is equal to the average capital account per-unit of the Company&rsquo;s OP Unit holders in the Operating Partnership.
We expect that the Operating Partnership will issue OP Units to limited partners, and the Company, in exchange for capital contributions
of cash or property, and will issue LTIP Units pursuant to the Company&rsquo;s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan for Individuals and 2014
Equity Incentive Plan for Entities (collectively the &ldquo;Incentive Plans&rdquo;), to persons who provide services to the Company,
including the Company&rsquo;s officers, directors and employees.</P>

Agreement, as amended, any holders of OP Units, other than the Company or its subsidiaries, will receive redemption rights which,
subject to certain restrictions and limitations, will enable them to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem their OP Units in
exchange for cash or, at the Company&rsquo;s option, shares of the Company&rsquo;s Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis.
The Company has agreed to file, not earlier than one year after the closing of the IPO, one or more registration statements registering
the issuance or resale of shares of its Class A common stock issuable upon redemption of the OP Units, including those issued upon
conversion of LTIP Units to the Manager and the Former Advisor. Subject to certain exceptions, the Operating Partnership will pay
all expenses in connection with the exercise of registration rights under the Partnership Agreement. Subsequent to December 31,
2015, the Company has filed a registration statement to provide for their issuance or resale.</P>

IPO on April 2, 2014, the Company&rsquo;s independent directors received an automatic grant of 5,000&nbsp;shares of restricted
stock on the initial effective date of the continuous registered offering and received an automatic grant of 2,500&nbsp;shares
of restricted stock when such directors were re-elected at each annual meeting of the Company&rsquo;s stockholders thereafter through
the 2013 annual meeting held on August 5, 2013. The restricted stock vested 20% at the time of the grant and 20% on each anniversary
thereafter over four years from the date of the grant. All shares of restricted stock granted to the independent directors receive
distributions, whether vested or unvested. The value of the restricted stock granted was determined at the date of grant. Commencing
with the Company&rsquo;s IPO, the Directors will no longer receive automatic grants upon appointment or reelection at each annual
meeting of the Company&rsquo;s stockholders.</P>
