                                     PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Briggs & Stratton is the world's largest producer of air cooled gasoline engines
for outdoor power equipment. Briggs & Stratton designs, manufactures, markets
and services these products for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
worldwide. These engines are primarily aluminum alloy gasoline engines ranging
from 3 to 25 horsepower.

Additionally, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Generac Portable Products,
LLC, Briggs & Stratton is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of
portable generators, pressure washers and related accessories. On May 15, 2001,
Briggs & Stratton acquired Generac Portable Products, Inc. Generac Portable
Products, Inc. was merged with, and into Generac Portable Products, LLC (GPP) on
June 30, 2002.

Briggs & Stratton conducts its operations in two reportable segments: Engines
and Power Products. Further information about Briggs & Stratton's business
segments is contained in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report.


ENGINES
GENERAL
Briggs & Stratton's engines are used primarily by the lawn and garden equipment
industry, which accounted for 85% of fiscal 2002 OEM engine sales. Major lawn
and garden equipment applications include walk-behind lawn mowers, riding lawn
mowers and garden tillers. The remaining 15% of OEM sales in fiscal 2002 were
for use on products for industrial, construction, agricultural and other
consumer applications, that include generators, pumps and pressure washers. Many
retailers specify Briggs & Stratton's engines on the powered equipment they sell
and the Briggs & Stratton name is often featured prominently on a product
despite the fact that the engine is just a component. Briggs & Stratton engines
are marketed under various brand names including Classic(TM), Sprint(TM),
Quattro(TM), Quantum(R), INTEK(TM), I/C(R), Industrial Plus(TM) and
Vanguard(TM).

In fiscal 2002, approximately 24% of Briggs & Stratton's net sales were derived
from sales in international markets, primarily to customers in Europe. Briggs &
Stratton serves its key international markets through its European regional
office in Switzerland, its distribution center in the Netherlands and sales and
service subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, France,
Germany, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa, Sweden and the United
Kingdom. Briggs & Stratton is a leading supplier of gasoline engines in
developed countries where there is an established lawn and garden equipment
market. Briggs & Stratton also exports engines to developing nations where its
engines are used in agricultural, marine, construction and other applications.

Briggs & Stratton engines are sold primarily by its worldwide sales force
through direct calls on customers. Briggs & Stratton's marketing staff and
engineers in the United States provide support and technical assistance to its
sales force.

Briggs & Stratton also manufactures replacement engines and service parts and
sells them to sales and service distributors. Briggs & Stratton owns its
principal international distributors. In the United States the distributors are
independently owned and operated. These distributors supply service parts and
replacement engines directly to approximately 35,000 independently owned,
authorized service dealers throughout the world. These distributors and service
dealers implement Briggs & Stratton's commitment to reliability and service.

CUSTOMERS
Briggs & Stratton's engine sales are made primarily to OEMs. Briggs & Stratton's
three largest engine customers in each of the last three fiscal years were AB
Electrolux (principally its Electrolux Home Products Group), MTD Products Inc.
and Murray Inc. (owned by Summersong Investments, Inc.). Sales to each of these
customers were more than 10% of net sales in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000. Sales
to all three combined were 47% of net sales in fiscal 2002, 46% of net sales in
fiscal 2001 and 45% of net sales in fiscal 2000. Under purchasing plans
available to all of its gasoline engine customers, Briggs & Stratton typically
enters into annual engine supply arrangements with these large customers.


                                       1
<PAGE>


Over the years, sales of lawn and garden equipment by mass merchandisers have
increased significantly in the United States, while sales by independent
distributors and dealers have declined. Briggs & Stratton believes that in
fiscal 2002 more than 75% of all lawn and garden equipment sold in the United
States was sold through mass merchandisers such as Sears, Roebuck and Co.
(Sears), The Home Depot, Inc. (The Home Depot), Wal*Mart Stores, Inc. and Lowe's
Home Centers, Inc. (Lowe's). Given the buying power of the mass merchandisers,
Briggs & Stratton, through its customers, has continued to experience pricing
pressure. Briggs & Stratton expects that this pricing trend will continue in the
foreseeable future. Briggs & Stratton believes that a similar trend has
developed for its products in industrial and consumer applications outside of
the lawn and garden market.

COMPETITION
The small gasoline engine industry is highly competitive. Briggs & Stratton's
major domestic competitors in engine manufacturing are Tecumseh Products Company
(Tecumseh), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (Honda), Kohler Co. and Kawasaki Heavy
Industries, Ltd. (Kawasaki). Also, a domestic lawn mower manufacturer, The Toro
Company under its Lawn-Boy brand, manufactures some of its own engines. Eight
Japanese small engine manufacturers, of which Honda and Kawasaki are the
largest, compete directly with Briggs & Stratton in world markets in the sale of
engines to other OEMs and indirectly through their sale of end products.
Tecumseh Europa S.p.A., located in Italy, is a major competitor in Europe.

Briggs & Stratton believes the major areas of competition from all engine
manufacturers include product quality, brand strength, price, timely delivery
and service. Other factors affecting competition are short-term market share
objectives, short-term profit objectives, exchange rate fluctuations,
technology, product support and distribution strength. Briggs & Stratton
believes its product value and service reputation have given it strong brand
name recognition and enhance its competitive position.

SEASONALITY OF DEMAND
Sales of engines to lawn and garden equipment manufacturers are highly seasonal
because of retail customer buying patterns. The majority of lawn and garden
equipment is sold during the spring and summer months when most lawn care and
gardening activities are performed. Sales of lawn and garden equipment are also
influenced by weather conditions. Sales in Briggs & Stratton's fiscal third
quarter have historically been the highest, while sales in the first fiscal
quarter have historically been the lowest.

In order to efficiently use its capital investments and meet seasonal demand for
engines, Briggs & Stratton pursues a relatively balanced production schedule
throughout the year. The schedule is adjusted to reflect changes in estimated
demand, customer inventory levels and other matters outside the control of
Briggs & Stratton. Accordingly, inventory levels are generally higher during the
first and second fiscal quarters in anticipation of increased customer demand.
Inventory levels begin to decrease as sales increase in the third fiscal
quarter. This seasonal pattern results in high inventories and low cash flow for
Briggs & Stratton in the second and the beginning of the third fiscal quarters.
The pattern results in higher cash flow in the latter portion of the third
fiscal quarter and in the fourth fiscal quarter as inventories are liquidated
and receivables are collected.

MANUFACTURING
Briggs & Stratton manufactures engines and parts at the following locations:
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin; Murray, Kentucky; Poplar Bluff and Rolla, Missouri;
Auburn, Alabama; and Statesboro, Georgia. Briggs & Stratton has a parts
distribution center in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.

Briggs & Stratton manufactures a majority of the structural components used in
its engines, including aluminum die castings, carburetors and ignition systems.
Briggs & Stratton purchases certain parts such as piston rings, spark plugs,
valves, ductile and grey iron castings, zinc die castings and plastic
components, some stampings and screw machine parts and smaller quantities of
other components. Raw material purchases consist primarily of aluminum and
steel. Briggs & Stratton believes its sources of supply are adequate.





                                       2
<PAGE>

Briggs & Stratton has joint ventures with Daihatsu Motor Company for the
manufacture of engines in Japan, with Puling Machinery Works and Yimin Machinery
Plant for the production of engines in China and with Starting Industrial of
Japan for the production of rewind starters in the U.S.

Briggs & Stratton has a strategic relationship with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
(MHI) for the global distribution of air cooled gasoline engines manufactured by
MHI in Japan under Briggs & Stratton's Vanguard(TM) brand.


POWER PRODUCTS
GENERAL
In May 2001, Briggs & Stratton acquired GPP. GPP's two principal product lines
are portable generators and pressure washers. GPP sells its products through
multiple channels of retail distribution, including home centers, warehouse
clubs, mass merchants and independent dealers. Under the Craftsman(TM) label,
GPP or its predecessor has been one of Sear's major suppliers of portable
generators (since 1961) and pressure washers. GPP is also a core supplier of
products to The Home Depot and Lowe's. In addition, GPP is a core supplier for
many of the leading retail home centers and do-it-yourself retailers throughout
the United States, Canada and Europe.

GPP has assembled a comprehensive after-sales service network in North America
for portable generators and pressure washers comprised of approximately 3,000
authorized independent dealers. GPP maintains its independent dealer network for
the purpose of providing the after-sales service capability that supports its
products.

To support GPP's European power generator business, local sales offices have
been established in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain.

CUSTOMERS
GPP sells to consumer home centers and warehouse clubs, as well as mass
merchants and independent dealers. Historically, GPP's major customers have been
Costco, Lowe's, The Home Depot and Sears. Other U.S. retail customers include
B.J.'s Wholesale Club, Sam's Club, Tractor Supply Company and Tru-Serv
Incorporated.

COMPETITION
The U.S. engine powered tools industry is highly concentrated with approximately
five competitors. The principal competitive factors in the engine powered tools
industry include price, service, product performance, technical innovation and
delivery. In the manufacture and sale of portable generators, GPP competes
primarily with Coleman Powermate (a division of The Coleman Company, Inc., an
affiliate of Sunbeam Corporation) and Honda. In the manufacture and sale of
pressure washers, GPP competes primarily with DeVilbiss Air Power Company (an
affiliate of Pentair, Inc.) and to a lesser extent, with Coleman Powermate,
Alfred Karcher GmbH & Co. and Campbell Hausfeld (an affiliate of Berkshire
Hathaway, Inc.).

GPP believes it has a significant share of the North American market for
portable generators and consumer pressure washers.

SEASONALITY OF DEMAND
Sales of GPP's products are subject to seasonal patterns. Due to seasonal and
regional weather factors, sales of pressure washers and related working capital
requirements are typically higher during the fiscal third and fourth quarters
than at other times of the year. Sales of generators are typically higher during
the summer storm season. The residential and commercial construction markets are
sensitive to cyclical changes in the economy.

MANUFACTURING
GPP's U.S. manufacturing facility is located in Jefferson, Wisconsin. GPP
produces portable generators and pressure washers at this location.

GPP manufactures core components for portable generators, including alternators,
where such integration improves operating profitability by providing lower
costs.



                                       3
<PAGE>

GPP purchases engines from its parent, Briggs & Stratton, as well as from
Generac Power Systems, Inc. and Honda. GPP has not experienced any difficulty
obtaining necessary purchased components.

To service GPP's European customer base more effectively, GPP designs and
assembles its European products in its Cheshire, England facility. This facility
imports alternators, engines and other components and assembles portable
generators to meet European product requirements.

CONSOLIDATED
GENERAL INFORMATION
Briggs & Stratton holds patents on features incorporated in its products;
however, the success of Briggs & Stratton's business is not considered to be
primarily dependent upon patent protection. Trademarks, licenses, franchises and
concessions are not a material factor in Briggs & Stratton's business.

For the years ending June 30, 2002, July 1, 2001 and July 2, 2000, Briggs &
Stratton spent approximately $23.7 million, $21.5 million and $24.3 million,
respectively, on research activities relating to the development of new products
or the improvement of existing products.

The average number of persons employed by Briggs & Stratton during the fiscal
year was 7,019. Employment ranged from a low of 6,192 in September 2001 to a
high of 7,371 in December 2001.

EXPORT SALES
Export sales for fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $365.5 million (24% of total
sales), $325.6 million (25% of total sales) and $358.1 million (23% of total
sales), respectively. These sales were principally to customers in European
countries. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
financial information about geographic areas. Also, refer to Item 7A of this
Form 10-K and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
information about Briggs & Stratton's foreign exchange risk management.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The corporate offices and one of Briggs & Stratton's engine manufacturing
facilities are located in a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Briggs & Stratton
also has engine manufacturing facilities in Murray, Kentucky; Poplar Bluff and
Rolla, Missouri; Auburn, Alabama and Statesboro, Georgia. These are owned
facilities containing 3.6 million square feet of office and production area.
Briggs & Stratton occupies warehouse space totalling approximately 400,000
square feet in a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin under a reservation of interest
agreement. Briggs & Stratton also leases warehouse space in the localities of
its engine manufacturing facilities, except Wisconsin, totalling 810,000 square
feet.

GPP's offices and domestic manufacturing facilities are located in Jefferson,
Wisconsin. GPP also has a manufacturing facility in Cheshire, England. These are
owned facilities containing 250,000 square feet of office and production area.
GPP leases warehouse space totalling 210,000 square feet in three communities in
Wisconsin.

The engine business with the OEMs is seasonal, with demand for engines at its
height in the winter and early spring. Engine manufacturing operations run at
capacity levels during the peak season, with many operations running three
shifts. Engine operations generally run fewer shifts in the summer, when demand
is weakest and production is considerably under capacity. During the winter,
when finished goods inventories reach their highest levels, owned warehouse
space may be insufficient and capacity may be expanded through rented space.
Excess warehouse space exists in the spring and summer seasons.

Briggs & Stratton leases approximately 300,000 square feet of space to house its
foreign sales and service operations in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, the
Czech Republic, France, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab
Emirates and the United Kingdom.

Briggs & Stratton's owned properties are well maintained. Briggs & Stratton
believes that its owned and leased facilities are adequate to perform its
operations in a reasonable manner.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Briggs & Stratton has announced the voluntary recall of approximately 162,000
engines used on Fun Karts. Fuel from the engine can spill out if the Fun Kart
overturns making serious injury a possibility. The recall only applies to
engines that are installed on Fun Karts, which look and ride like go carts, but
were sold for personal use. The models included in the recall are:

-    All 5 hp model series beginning with numbers 1352XX installed on Fun Karts.

-    Only Fun Power model series beginning with numbers 1362XX made before June
     22, 1995 and installed on Fun Karts.

Briggs & Stratton discontinued sale of these engines to OEM manufacturers in
1995.

The entire estimated cost of the recall and a related civil penalty imposed by
the Consumer Product Safety Commission is reflected in fiscal 2002 net income at
$1.5 million or $.06 per diluted share.

We do not believe the recall will have a material effect on Briggs & Stratton's
financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the three months ended June 30,
2002.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001

Sales
Fiscal 2002 net sales were approximately $1.5 billion, an increase of $219
million, or 17% compared to the previous year. Generac Portable Products (GPP),
included for a full fiscal year first time, added $186 million in sales the
fiscal year. Our engine unit volume increase of 8%, offset by an unfavorable
sales mix weighted towards lower priced engines accounts for the majority of the
remaining increase.

Gross Profit
The total Company gross profit rate of approximately 18% was comparable with
fiscal 2001. The Engine segment gross profit rate remained approximately 18% in
fiscal 2002. Reductions in manufacturing costs of $25 million (primarily,
repairs and maintenance, processing supplies, utilities and warranty) were
offset by $17 million of increased costs (primarily, fringe benefits which
included rising healthcare costs). GPP margins were approximately 9% for fiscal
2002, similar to their results for the 12 months ended June, 2001.

Engineering, Selling, General and Administrative Costs
Engineering, selling, general and administrative costs increased $16 million or
12% compared to fiscal 2001. The increase is entirely attributable to the
inclusion of $18 million of GPP engineering, selling, general, and
administrative costs for a full year. The Engine segment Engineering, Selling
and Administrative cost category experienced increased salaries and fringe
benefit expenses of approximately $8 million, but these increases were offset by
a $6 million impact of lower bad debt write-off experience and a bad debt
recovery, and $3 million of lower marketing expenses.

Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $14 million in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001,
essentially the impact of increased borrowings associated with the GPP
acquisition.

Other Income
Other income increased $3 million in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. This
increase is attributable to a $9 million increase in foreign currency
transaction gains offset by $5 million in derivative losses and $1 million in
amortization of deferred financing costs from the GPP acquisition.

Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate increased to 34.0% in fiscal 2002 from 33.2%. The
effective rates both reflect a refund on Foreign Sales Corporation tax benefits,
however, the fiscal 2001 refund was larger.

FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000

Acquisition
On May 15, 2001, Briggs & Stratton acquired GPP for net cash of $267 million.
Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on the acquisition.

Sales
Net sales for fiscal 2001 totaled approximately $1.3 billion, a decrease of $281
million or 18% compared to the preceding year. The primary factors were a 10%
decline in engine unit volume, 15% lower sales of service components due to
Briggs & Stratton's distributors having an adequate stock of parts, and an
unfavorable sales mix as the entire 10% engine unit decline was made up of
larger horsepower engines. Inventories of riding equipment at the OEMs and
retailers were more than adequate to address soft demand for riding lawn and
garden equipment.

The other major factor adversely affecting the fiscal year was the weak Euro
which lowered revenues by $24 million. Additionally, these revenues decreased
because Briggs & Stratton's pricing reflected the need to remain competitive in
the European market.

The acquisition of GPP added $30 million in sales.

Gross Profit
The gross profit rate decreased to 18% from 21% in fiscal 2000. The major
reasons for the decrease were lower plant utilization having a $32 million
impact and the weak Euro of $24 million. Offsetting these factors was the
favorable pension income impact of $12 million. Pension income included in gross
profit totaled $24 million in fiscal 2001.

Engineering, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5 million
or 4% compared to fiscal 2000. Expenses in this category increased almost $20
million. The majority of the increase was due to the following factors: a $16
million planned expansion of staff and expenditures for business development and
introduction of new product, a





                                       9

$3 million bad debt write-off, and $3 million of GPP's operating costs
incurred since the acquisition. The increased costs were offset by $14 million
of lower employee benefit costs for profit sharing and increased pension income.
Pension income in this category was $4 million in fiscal 2001.

Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $9 million or 44% in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal
2000 because the level of borrowings was greater in fiscal 2001. The increased
level of borrowings resulted from increased seasonal working capital needs and
the funding of the GPP acquisition.

Other Income
Other income decreased $13 million in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. This
decrease is attributed primarily to an $8 million reduction in equity income
from joint ventures and investments and $5 million in foreign currency
transaction losses.

Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate decreased to 33.2% in fiscal 2001 from 37.0% in the
previous year. The majority of the decrease was the result of the finalization
and approval by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation of a refund on our
Federal taxes related to Foreign Sales Corporation tax benefits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

FISCAL YEARS 2002, 2001 AND 2000

Cash flow from operating activities was $200 million, $68 million and $77
million, in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The fiscal 2002 cash flow from operating activities increased $132 million,
which was driven primarily by a reduction in inventory and an increase in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in inventory levels was
achieved through increased sales volume, while holding production levels
consistent between years.

The fiscal 2001 cash flow from operating activities decreased $10 million, which
reflects lower gains on the disposition of plant and equipment of $16 million.
The lower gains from disposition of plant and equipment were because fiscal 2000
contained the disposition of the foundry assets. The increase in inventories was
$114 million less in fiscal 2001 compared to the fiscal 2000 increase. This
decrease was the result of planned inventory increases in fiscal 2000 to
replenish abnormally low inventories to more normal levels. The change in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities was $48 million less in fiscal 2001 due
to timing of payments and lack of accruals for profit sharing due to lower
performance. The $18 million increase in pension income is attributable to
Briggs & Stratton's over funded pension plan.

The fiscal 2000 cash flow from operating activities decreased $38 million. This
reflects increased net income of $30 million offset by the gain on disposition
of foundry assets of $17 million and an increased requirement for operating
capital of $41 million caused by increases in inventories at the end of fiscal
2000 offset by lower accounts receivable.

Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $38 million, $318 million and
$43 million in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These cash flows
include capital expenditures of $44 million, $61 million and $71 million in
fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These capital expenditures relate
primarily to reinvestment in equipment, capacity additions and new products.

The fiscal 2001 cash used in investing activities includes $267 million of cash
paid for the GPP acquisition, net of cash acquired. The fiscal 2000 cash used in
investing activities is net of $24 million of proceeds received on disposition
of plant and equipment.

Briggs & Stratton used cash in financing activities totalling $38 million and
$77 million in fiscal 2002 and 2000, respectively. Briggs & Stratton provided
cash through financing activities totalling $324 million in fiscal 2001. During
fiscal 2002 Briggs & Stratton repaid $10 million of its 7.25% Senior Notes due
2007. Financing activities in fiscal 2001 included $399 million of proceeds
received from issuing the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 and the 8.875%
Senior Notes due 2011, in order to fund the acquisition of GPP and payment of
short term borrowings. During fiscal 2000, Briggs & Stratton repaid the
remaining $30 million on the 9.21% Senior Notes due 2001. Briggs & Stratton
repurchased $6 million and $69 million of common shares in fiscal 2001 and 2000,
respectively. There were no common shares repurchased in fiscal 2002.

Briggs & Stratton's significant contractual obligations are its pension plans,
post retirement benefit obligations and deferred compensation arrangements. All
of these obligations are recorded on our Balance Sheets and disclosed more fully
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, Briggs &
Stratton is subject to certain financial and operating restrictions under its
domestic debt agreements. As is fully disclosed in Note 6 of the notes to
consolidated financial statements, these restrictions limit our ability to: pay
dividends; incur further indebtedness; create liens; enter into sale and/or
leaseback transactions; consolidate, sell or





                                       10
<PAGE>



lease all or substantially all of our assets; and dispose of assets or the
proceeds of our assets, in addition to certain financial covenants. We believe
we will remain in compliance with these covenants in fiscal 2003.

Future Liquidity and Capital Resources
Briggs & Stratton has a three-year $300 million revolving credit facility. This
credit facility is used to fund seasonal working capital requirements and other
financing needs. This facility and Briggs & Stratton's other indebtedness
contain certain restrictive covenants. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Briggs & Stratton expects capital expenditures to be $60 million for fiscal
2003. These anticipated expenditures are for continued investments in equipment
and new products.

Management believes that available cash, the credit facility, cash generated
from operations, existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be
adequate to fund Briggs & Stratton's capital requirements for the foreseeable
future.

FINANCIAL STRATEGY

Management believes that the value of Briggs & Stratton is enhanced if the
capital invested in operations yields a cash return that is greater than the
cost of capital. In addition, Management believes that when capital cannot be
invested for returns greater than the cost of capital, they should return the
capital to the capital providers. Briggs & Stratton also believes that the
substitution of lower (after-tax) cost debt for equity in its permanent capital
structure will reduce its overall cost of capital. Examples of the above beliefs
are the repurchase of common stock from fiscal 1997 to 2001 when capital was not
required for operational expansion and the fiscal 2001 increase of capital
through debt for an acquisition. Briggs & Stratton believes its profitability
and strong cash flows will accommodate the increased use of debt without
impairing its ability to finance growth or increase cash dividends per share on
its common stock.

Briggs & Stratton has remaining authorization to buy up to 1.8 million shares of
its stock in open market or private transactions under the June 2000 Board of
Directors' authorization to repurchase up to 2.0 million shares. Briggs &
Stratton did not repurchase shares in fiscal 2002 and does not anticipate any
repurchases in fiscal 2003.

Also as a part of its financial strategy, subject to the discretion of its Board
of Directors and the requirements of applicable law and debt covenants, Briggs &
Stratton currently intends to increase future cash dividends per share at a rate
approximating the inflation rate.

OTHER MATTERS

Early Retirement Incentive Program
In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, Briggs & Stratton offered and finalized an
early retirement incentive program. The net reduction in the global salaried
workforce was approximately 7%.

The impact for fiscal year 2002 was a reduction in net income on an after-tax
basis of $2.5 million, after consideration of approximately $3 million in
savings for lower salary related expenditures. The majority of the impact on net
income was the result of recognizing the cost of the special termination
benefits, which reduced net periodic pension income. The anticipated net income
impact of salary related savings for fiscal 2003 is projected to be
approximately $6 million on an after-tax basis.

General
In July 2001, Briggs & Stratton extended its collective bargaining agreement
with one of its unions. This agreement expires in 2006, and contains provisions
for future wage increases, medical cost sharing and increased pension benefits.

Emissions
Briggs & Stratton implemented a supplemental compliance plan for model years
2000 and 2001 with the California Air Resources Board (CARB), as required of
companies that sold more than a threshold number of Class I engines into
California. The objective of the plan was to achieve additional reductions in
extreme non-attainment areas. While CARB's aggressive program resulted in a
reduced product offering by Briggs & Stratton in California, the California
program did not have a material effect on Briggs & Stratton's financial
condition or results of operations.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed national emission
standards under a two phase process for small air cooled engines. Briggs &
Stratton currently has a complete product offering which complies with the EPA's
Phase I engine emission standards. The Phase II program imposes more stringent
standards over the useful life of the engine and is being phased in from 2001 to
2005 for Class II (225 or greater cubic centimeter displacement) engines and
from 2003 to 2008 for Class I (under 225 cubic centimeter displacement) engines.
Briggs & Stratton does not believe compliance with the new standards will have a
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies
Briggs & Stratton's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in Note 1, the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and
assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects
cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of
estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will
differ from those estimates, and such difference may be material to the
financial statements.

The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our
financial statements include estimates as to the recovery of accounts
receivable, as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to
customer rebates, pension obligations, warranty, product liability, group health
insurance and taxation. Various assumptions and other factors underlie the
determination of these significant estimates. The process of determining
significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as
historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix,
and in some instances actuarial techniques. Briggs & Stratton reevaluates these
significant factors as facts and circumstances change. Historically, actual
results have not differed significantly from our estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncements
The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Abstract No. 01-09,
"Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a
Reseller of Vendor's Products)". This was adopted during fiscal 2002. Pursuant
to EITF No. 01-09, Briggs & Stratton was required to reclassify co-op
advertising expense previously reported as selling expense to a reduction in net
sales. The impact of adopting EITF 01-09 was to reduce net sales by $7.2
million, $2.3 million and $1.3 million in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS
No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". SFAS No. 141 provides for the
elimination of the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business
combinations with an acquisition date of July 1, 2001 or later. SFAS No. 142
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives and requires periodic reassessment of the underlying value of
such assets for impairment. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. On July 2, 2001, Briggs & Stratton adopted SFAS No.
142. Application of the nonamortization provision of SFAS No. 142 resulted in an
increase in net income of approximately $.7 million in fiscal 2002.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144,
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which
supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of." SFAS No. 144 also supersedes the
accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, related to the
disposal of a segment of a business. Briggs & Stratton adopted SFAS No. 144 on
July 1, 2002. Management does not expect that SFAS No. 144 will have a material
impact on Briggs & Stratton's consolidated financial statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities". SFAS No. 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred
in a Restructuring)" and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an
exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. SFAS No.
146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002. Briggs & Stratton does not expect that the adoption of this
statement will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial
position.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Briggs & Stratton is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and
interest rates. To reduce the risk from changes in foreign exchange rates,
Briggs & Stratton uses financial instruments. Briggs & Stratton does not hold or
issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
Briggs & Stratton's earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the
U.S. dollar against the Japanese Yen and Euro. The Yen is used to purchase
engines from Briggs & Stratton's joint venture, while Briggs & Stratton receives
Euros for certain products sold to European customers. Briggs & Stratton's
foreign subsidiaries' earnings are also influenced by fluctuations of the local
currency against the U.S. dollar as these subsidiaries purchase inventory from
the parent in U.S. dollars. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to
partially hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations. At June 30,
2002, Briggs & Stratton had the following forward foreign exchange contracts
outstanding with the Fair Value Gains (Losses) shown (in thousands):

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

Austrailian Dollars     1,950       1,086        U.S.               (11)
Canadian Dollars          900         592        U.S.                 6
British Pounds            622       1,691        Austrailian        (26)
U.S. Dollars              421         748        Austrailian         26
</TABLE>


All of the above contracts expire within twelve months.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the shareholders'
investment in Briggs & Stratton. Amounts invested in Briggs & Stratton's
non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in
effect at fiscal year end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in
shareholders' investment as cumulative translation adjustments. The cumulative
translation adjustments component of shareholders' investment increased $4
million during the year. Using the year-end exchange rates, the total amount
invested in non-U.S. subsidiaries on June 30, 2002 was $26.8 million.

INTEREST RATES
Briggs & Stratton is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings.
Briggs & Stratton manages its interest rate exposure through a combination of
fixed and variable rate debt. Depending on general economic conditions, Briggs &
Stratton has typically used variable rate debt for short-term borrowings and
fixed rate debt for longer-term borrowings.

On June 30, 2002, Briggs & Stratton had the following short-term loans
outstanding (amounts in thousands):

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

                                    Weighted Average
Currency             Amount          Interest Rate
--------             ------         ----------------
<S>                 <C>             <C>
Euro                 15,074              5.46%
U.S. Dollars          2,625              4.00%
Canadian Dollars        493              3.10%
</TABLE>


These loans carry variable interest rates. Assuming borrowings are outstanding
for an entire year an increase (decrease) of one percentage point in the
weighted average interest rate, would increase (decrease) interest expense by
$.2 million.

Long-term loans, net of unamortized discount, consisted of the following
(amounts in thousands):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2002, JULY 1, 2001 AND JULY 2, 2000

(1) NATURE OF OPERATIONS:
Briggs & Stratton ("the Company") is a U.S. based producer of air cooled
gasoline engines. These engines are sold worldwide, primarily to original
equipment manufacturers of lawn and garden equipment and other gasoline engine
powered equipment. Additionally, through the Company's wholly owned subsidiary,
Generac Portable Products, LLC (GPP), the company is a designer, manufacturer
and marketer of portable and standby generators, pressure washers and related
accessories. GPP's products are sold throughout the United States, Canada and
Europe.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Fiscal Year: The Company's fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the
Sunday nearest the last day of June in each year. Therefore, the 2002 and 2001
fiscal years were 52 weeks long, and the 2000 fiscal year was 53 weeks long. All
references to years relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years.

Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries
after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.

Accounting Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those
estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents: This caption includes cash, commercial paper and
certificates of deposit. The Company considers all highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.

Inventories: Inventories are stated at cost, which does not exceed market. The
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method was used for determining the cost of
approximately 68% of total inventories at June 30, 2002 and 77% of total
inventories at July 1, 2001. The cost for the remaining portion of the
inventories was determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. During
2002, a reduction in inventory quantities resulted in a liquidation of LIFO
inventories carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The liquidation of
these inventories has reduced cost of sales by $2.6 million in 2002. If the FIFO
inventory valuation method had been used exclusively, inventories would have
been $44.8 million and $51.2 million higher in the respective years. The LIFO
inventory adjustment was determined on an overall basis, and accordingly, each
class of inventory reflects an allocation based on the FIFO amounts.

Investments: This caption represents the Company's investments in three
50%-owned joint ventures, preferred stock in a privately held iron castings
business and common stock in a publicly traded software company. The common
stock in the publicly traded company is being classified as available-for-sale
and is reported at a fair market value. Unrealized losses incurred on this stock
are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in the
Shareholders' Investment section of the balance sheet. The investments in the
joint ventures and the privately held business are accounted for under the
equity method.

Deferred Loan Costs: Expenses associated with the issuance of debt instruments
are capitalized and are being amortized over the terms of the respective
financing arrangement using the straight-line method over periods ranging from
five to ten years. Accumulated amortization amounted to $1.6 million as of June
30, 2002 and $.1 million as of July 1, 2001.

Other Long-Term Assets: This caption primarily represents costs of software used
in the Company's business. Amortization of capitalized software is computed on
an item-by-item basis over a period of three to ten years, depending on the
estimated useful life of the software. Accumulated amortization amounted to $8.4
million as of June 30, 2002 and $7.4 million as of July 1, 2001.

Goodwill: This caption represents goodwill related to the acquisition of GPP in
fiscal 2001 (See Note 3). Goodwill reflects the cost of an acquisition in excess
of the fair values assigned to identifiable net assets acquired. The carrying
value of goodwill was



                                       19

NOTES ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$161.0 million and $166.7 million at June 30, 2002 and July 1, 2001,
respectively. In accordance with SFAS 142, no goodwill amortization was recorded
in fiscal year 2002, $1.1 million was reported in fiscal year 2001. The Company
performed the required impairment test of goodwill in fiscal 2002 and found no
impairment of the asset.

Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: Plant and equipment are stated at cost and
depreciation is computed using the straight-line method at rates based upon the
estimated useful lives of the assets (20-30 years for land improvements, 20-50
years for buildings and 8-16 years for machinery and equipment).

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which significantly extend the
useful lives of existing plant and equipment, are capitalized and depreciated.
Upon retirement or disposition of plant and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in other income.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Property, plant and equipment and other
long-term assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the
sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of
the related asset or group of assets, a loss is recognized for the difference
between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets. There
were no adjustments to the carrying value of long-lived assets in fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144,
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which
supersedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of." SFAS No. 144 also supersedes the
accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, related to the
disposal of a segment of a business. The Company adopted SFAS No. 144 on July 1,
2002. Management does not expect SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when title to the products being sold
transfers to the customer, which is upon shipment.

Deferred Revenue on Sale of Plant and Equipment: In fiscal 1997, the Company
sold its Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin facility for approximately $16.0 million.
The provisions of the contract state that the Company will continue to own and
occupy the warehouse portion of the facility for a period of up to ten years
(the Reservation Period). The contract also contains a buyout clause, at the
buyer's option and under certain circumstances, of the remaining Reservation
Period. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real
Estate," the Company is required to account for this as a financing transaction
as long as it continues to have substantial involvement with the facility during
the Reservation Period or until the buyout option is exercised. Under this
method, the cash received is reflected as deferred revenue and the assets and
the accumulated depreciation remain on the Company's books. Depreciation expense
continues to be recorded each period and imputed interest expense is also
recorded and added to deferred revenue. Offsetting this is the imputed fair
value lease income on the non-Briggs & Stratton occupied portion of the
building. A pretax gain, which will be recognized at the earlier of the exercise
of the buyout option or the expiration of the Reservation Period, is estimated
to be $10 - $12 million. The annual cost of operating the warehouse portion of
the facility is not material.

Income Taxes: The Provision for Income Taxes includes Federal, state and foreign
income taxes currently payable and those deferred or prepaid because of
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets
and liabilities. The Future Income Tax Benefits represent temporary differences
relating to current assets and current liabilities and the Deferred Income Tax
Assets/Liabilities represent temporary differences relating to noncurrent assets
and liabilities.

Research and Development Costs: Expenditures relating to the development of new
products and processes, including significant improvements and refinements to
existing products, are expensed as incurred. The amounts charged against income
were $23.7 million in fiscal 2002, $21.5 million in fiscal 2001 and $24.3
million in fiscal 2000.



                                       20

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advertising Costs: Advertising costs, included in Engineering, Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Earnings, are expensed as incurred. These expenses totaled $8.3 million in
fiscal 2002, $7.8 million in fiscal 2001 and $6.8 million in fiscal 2000.

The Company adopted EITF No. 01-09, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of Vendor's Products)," in the third
quarter of fiscal 2002. Pursuant to EITF No. 01-09, the Company was required to
reclassify co-op advertising expense previously reported as selling expense as a
reduction in net sales. The impact of adopting EITF 01-09 was to reduce net
sales by $7.2 million, $2.3 million and $1.3 million in fiscal 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: Revenue received from shipping and
handling fees is reflected in net sales. Shipping fee revenue for fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000 was $1.6 million, $1.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold.

Foreign Currency Translation: Foreign currency balance sheet accounts are
translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at
fiscal year end. Income and expenses are translated at the average rates of
exchange in effect during the year. The related translation adjustments are made
directly to a separate component of Shareholders' Investment.

Earnings Per Share: The Company's earnings per share were computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share, for each period presented, were
computed on the assumption that stock options were exercised at the beginning of
the periods reported. The difference between weighted average shares outstanding
and diluted average shares outstanding reflects the dilutive effects of stock
options and the convertible senior notes.

The shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share for fiscal
2002, 2001 and 2000 excluded outstanding options to purchase 1,841,640,
1,679,564 and 1,079,564 shares of common stock, respectively, with
weighted-average exercise prices of $55.14, $56.33 and $61.95, respectively. The
options were excluded because their exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of the common shares and their inclusion in the computation
would have been antidilutive.

Information on earnings per share is as follows (in thousands of dollars, except
per share data):

Comprehensive Income: SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," requires
the reporting of comprehensive income in addition to net income from operations.
Comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial reporting method that
includes disclosure of financial information that historically has not been
recognized in the calculation of net income. The Company has chosen to report
Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) which
encompasses net income, unrealized gain (loss) on marketable securities, foreign
currency translation, and unrealized gain on derivatives in the Consolidated
Statements of Shareholders' Investment. Information on accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) is as follows (in thousands of dollars):

</TABLE>

Derivatives: The Company enters into derivative contracts designated as cash
flow hedges to manage its foreign currency exposures. These instruments
generally do not have a maturity of more than twelve months. SFAS No. 133
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" requires
companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities,
measured at fair value. Any changes in fair value of these instruments are
recorded in the income statement or other comprehensive income. On July 2, 2000,
the impact of adopting SFAS No. 133 on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
resulted in a loss of $15 thousand. The Company reclassified immaterial amounts
to the income statement during fiscal 2002 and 2001. The cumulative effect of
adopting SFAS No. 133 on the results of operations was immaterial.

During the fiscal year, there were no derivative instruments that were deemed to
be ineffective. The amounts included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
will be reclassified into income when the forecasted transaction occurs,
generally within the next twelve months. These forecasted transactions represent
the exporting of products for which the Company will receive foreign currency
and the importing of products for which the Company will be required to pay in a
foreign currency.

Reclassification: Certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Business Combinations: In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets" having a required effective date for fiscal years
beginning after December 31, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and other
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized
but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the
Statements. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their
useful lives.

The Company adopted the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. The Company performed the
required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in
fiscal 2002 and found no impairment of the assets as of June 30, 2002. Had the
provisions of SFAS No. 142 been applied in fiscal 2001, the Company's fiscal
2001 net income would have increased $.7 million, or $.03 per basic and diluted
earnings per share.

Future Accounting Pronouncement: In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,
"Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" SFAS No. 146
nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
(including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" and requires that a
liability for a cost

associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is
incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company does not expect that the adoption
of this statement will have a material impact on the Company's results of
operations or financial position.

(3) ACQUISITION:
On May 15, 2001, the Company acquired Generac Portable Products, Inc. Generac
Portable Products, Inc. was merged with, and into Generac Portable Products, LLC
(GPP) on June 30, 2002. GPP is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of portable
and standby generators, pressure washers and related accessories. The aggregate
purchase price of $288.1 million included $267.6 million of cash and $20.5
million of liabilities assumed. The cash paid included $.5 million of cash
acquired and $4.5 million of direct acquisition costs, and was funded through
the issuance of the 8.875% senior notes as more fully described in Note 6.

The provisions of the acquisition included a contingent purchase price based on
the operating results of GPP. The Company will not pay any additional purchase
price pursuant to these provisions.

The provisions of the acquisition also provide for a potential purchase price
refund based on the final valuation of the acquired inventory. The amount of
this purchase price refund, if any, will be recorded as a reduction in goodwill
when it is received.

The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis to identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values, with
the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. This initial purchase price
allocation resulted in approximately $167.7 million of goodwill which was
amortized on a straight-line basis over twenty years until the Company adopted
SFAS No. 142 on July 2, 2001. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer
amortized, but is subject to periodic impairment tests.

In 2002 the Company reduced goodwill by approximately $5.7 million related to
the finalization of the purchase price allocation. This decrease was primarily
the result of recording $16.0 million of deferred taxes related to differences
in GPP's financial reporting versus tax reporting, offset by approximately $10.3
million of additional inventory and fixed asset reserves.

The following table sets forth the unaudited pro forma information for the
Company as if the acquisition of GPP had occurred on July 2, 2000 (in millions,
except per share data):

The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations. These undistributed earnings amounted to approximately $8.0 million
at June 30, 2002. If these earnings were remitted to the U.S., they would be
subject to U.S. income tax.

However, this tax would be substantially less than the U.S. statutory income tax
because of available foreign tax credits.

(6) INDEBTEDNESS:
As of November 15, 2001, the Company replaced its $250 million revolving credit
facility that would have expired in April 2002, with a three-year $300 million
revolving credit facility (the credit facility) that expires in September 2004.
The Company also has access to domestic lines of credit (domestic lines)
totaling $15.0 million that remain in effect until canceled by either party. The
domestic lines provide amounts for short-term use at the then prevailing rate.
There are no significant compensating balance requirements for any of these
domestic lines. There were no borrowings using these domestic lines or the
credit facility as of June 30, 2002 and July 1, 2001.

Borrowings under the credit facility by the Company bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to, at its option, either:

(1) a 1, 2, 3 or 6 month LIBOR rate plus a margin varying from 0.50% to 1.75%,
depending upon the rating of the Company's long-term debt by Standard & Poor's
Rating group, a division of McGraw-Hill Companies (S&P) and Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. (Moody's) or

(2) the higher of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (b) the bank's prime
rate plus a margin of up to 0.25%, also depending on the Company's long-term
credit ratings.

In addition, the Company is subject to a 0.10% to 0.35% commitment fee and a
0.50% to 1.75% letter of credit fee, depending on the Company's long-term credit
ratings.

The following data relates to domestic notes payable (in thousands of dollars):

In May 2001, the Company issued $275.0 million of 8.875% Senior Notes due March
15, 2011 and $140.0 million of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 15, 2006.
The convertible senior notes are convertible at the option of the holders into
the Company's common stock at the conversion rate of 20.1846 shares per each
$1,000 of convertible notes. Interest is paid semi-annually on both series of
notes. No principal payments are due before the maturity dates.

The net proceeds from the sale of the 8.875% senior notes and 5.00% convertible
senior notes were used to fund the Company's acquisition of GPP, including the
replacement of GPP's outstanding debt and to repay a portion of the Company's
unrated commercial paper and short-term borrowings under its credit facilities.

The 7.25% senior notes are due September 15, 2007. In accordance with the
agreement, no principal payments are due before the maturity date, however the
Company repurchased $10 million of the bonds in the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2002 after receiving unsolicited offers from bondholders.

notes, the 5.00% convertible senior notes and the Company's credit

facility (collectively, the Domestic Indebtedness) each include a number of
financial and operating restrictions. These covenants include restrictions on
the Company's ability to: pay dividends; incur indebtedness; create liens; enter
into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or
substantially all of its assets; and dispose of assets or the proceeds of sales
of its assets. The credit facility contains financial covenants that require the
Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and net worth (for fiscal
2003 the Company is required to maintain a minimum net worth of $376.6 million),
impose a maximum leverage ratio and total funded debt to EBITDA ratio and impose
capital expenditure limits. In addition, the credit facility contains provisions
that only apply if the Company's credit rating from S&P is BB or below or from
Moody's is Ba2 or below. As of June 30, 2002, the Company was in compliance with
these covenants.

Additionally, under the terms of the indentures governing the Domestic
Indebtedness, GPP became a joint and several guarantor of amounts outstanding
under the Domestic Indebtedness. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for subsidiary guarantor financial information.

(8) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

Product and general liability claims arise against the Company from time to time
in the ordinary course of business. The Company is generally self-insured for
claims up to $1 million per claim. Accordingly, a reserve is maintained for the
estimated costs of such claims. On June 30, 2002 and July 1, 2001 the reserve
for product and general liability claims was $2.8 million and $3.6 million,
respectively. Because there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual
resolution of unsettled claims, no reasonable range of possible losses can be
determined. Management does not anticipate that these claims, excluding the
impact of insurance proceeds and reserves, will have a material adverse effect
on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

The Company has no material commitments for materials or capital expenditures as
of June 30, 2002.

(9) STOCK OPTIONS:

The Company has a Stock Incentive Plan under which 5,361,935 shares of common
stock have been reserved for issuance. The Company accounts for the plan under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, and no compensation cost has been
recognized. Had compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent
with SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the Company's net
income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma
amounts:

(10) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN:

On August 6, 1996, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of
one common stock purchase right (a right) for each share of the Company's common
stock outstanding on August 19, 1996. Each right would entitle shareowners to
buy one-half of one share of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of
$160.00 per full common share, subject to adjustment. The rights are not
currently exercisable, but would become exercisable if events occurred relating
to a person or group acquiring or attempting to acquire 15 percent or more of
the outstanding shares of common stock. The rights expire on August 19, 2006,
unless redeemed or exchanged by the Company earlier.

(11) FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT:

The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge purchases and sales
that are denominated in foreign currencies. The terms of these currency
derivatives generally do not exceed twelve months and the purpose is to protect
the Company from the risk that the eventual dollars being transferred will be
adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.

The Company has forward foreign currency exchange contracts to purchase Japanese
yen. These contracts are used to hedge the commitments to purchase engines from
the Company's Japanese joint venture. The Company also has forward contracts to
sell foreign currency. These contracts are used to hedge foreign currency
collections on sales of inventory. The Company's foreign currency forward
contracts are carried at fair value based on current exchange rates.

The Company has the following forward currency contracts outstanding at the end
of fiscal 2002:

In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company offered and finalized an early
retirement incentive program. As a result, the Company recorded $4.9 million of
expense offsetting pension income of $26 million and $2.2 million was added to
postretirement health care expense. The impact for the full fiscal year of 2002
reduced net income on an after-tax basis by $2.5 million, after consideration of
salary and related expenditures savings.

In July 2001, the Company extended its collective bargaining agreement with one
of its unions. As part of this contract extension, the Company agreed to pay
certain amounts to employees who were hired prior to January 1, 1980 upon their
retirement. The impact of this plan amendment is included in the above tables.

As described in Note 14, the Company contributed its two ductile iron foundries
to Metal Technologies Holding Company, Inc. (MTHC). In connection with the
contribution, MTHC agreed to assume pension and postretirement benefit
obligations related to employees working at the foundries at the time of the
transaction. The Company transferred to MTHC pension assets amounting to $11.3
million in fiscal 2001. The assumption of obligations by MTHC and transfer of
pension assets did not result in a gain or loss to the Company.

The Company's supplemental pension plan has benefit obligations in excess of
plan assets. The benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair
value of plan assets were $25.2 million, $17.9 million and $.1 million
respectively for fiscal year 2002 and $19.0 million, $14.9 million and $0
respectively for fiscal year 2001. The postretirement benefit plans are
essentially unfunded.

For measurement purposes a 9% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered health care claims was assumed for the fiscal year 2003 decreasing
gradually to 5% for the fiscal year 2008. The health care cost trend rate
assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. An increase of one
percentage point, would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit by $8.1
million and would increase the service and interest cost by $.8 million for the
year. A corresponding decrease of one percentage point, would decrease the
accumulated postretirement benefit by $7.5 million and decrease the service and
interest cost by $.7 million for the fiscal year.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan that includes most U.S.
non-Wisconsin employees. Under the plan, the Company makes an annual
contribution on behalf of covered employees equal to 2% of each participant's
gross income, as defined. For the fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, the net
expense related to these plans was $1.6 million, $.2 million and $2.1 million,
respectively.

Wisconsin employees of the Company may participate in a salary reduction
deferred compensation retirement plan. A maximum of 1-1/2% or 3% of each
participant's salary, depending upon the participant's group, is matched by the
Company. The Company contributions totaled $4.1 million in 2002, $4.7 million in
2001 and $4.6 million in 2000.

Postemployment Benefits

The Company accrues the expected cost of postemployment benefits over the years
that the employees render service. These benefits are substantially smaller
amounts because they apply only to employees who permanently terminate
employment prior to retirement. The items include disability payments, life
insurance and medical benefits. These amounts are also discounted using an
interest rate of 7.25% and 7.5% for fiscal year 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Amounts are included in Accrued Employee Benefits in the balance sheet.

(13) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables, Accounts Payable, Domestic Notes
Payable, Foreign Loans and Accrued Liabilities: The carrying amounts approximate
fair market value because of the short maturity of these instruments.

Long-Term Debt: The fair market value of the Company's long-term debt is
estimated based on market quotations at year end.

The estimated fair market values of the Company's financial instruments are (in
thousands of dollars):

(14) DISPOSITION OF BUSINESS:

At the end of August 1999, the Company contributed its two ductile iron
foundries to MTHC in exchange for $23.6 million in cash and $45.0 million
aggregate par value convertible preferred stock. The provisions of the preferred
stock include a 15% cumulative dividend and conversion rights into a minimum of
31% of MTHC common stock. Pursuant to EITF Abstract No. 86-29, the Company
considered this contribution to be a monetary transaction, given the significant
amount of cash received and recorded the consideration received at fair value.
The preferred stock received was determined to have a fair value of $21.6
million based on provisions of the stock and the prevailing market returns for
similar investments, estimated to be 30%, as of the date of the transaction.

MTHC is the primary supplier to the Company for iron castings. There are no
other material arrangements between the Company and MTHC.

Based on the above and the fair market value of all consideration received, the
transaction resulted in a $16.5 million gain.

(15) SEPARATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS OF INDEBTEDNESS

Under the terms of the Company's Domestic Indebtedness (described in Note 6),
GPP became a joint and several guarantor of the Domestic Indebtedness.
Additionally, if at any time a domestic subsidiary of the Company constitutes a
significant domestic subsidiary, then the domestic subsidiary will also become a
guarantor of the Domestic Indebtedness. Each guarantee of the Domestic
Indebtedness is the obligation of the guarantor and ranks equally and ratably
with the existing and future senior unsecured obligations of that guarantor;
accordingly, GPP has provided a full and unconditional guarantee of the Domestic
Indebtedness. The condensed supplemental consolidating financial information
reflects the operations of GPP (in thousands of dollars):

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Shareholders of
Briggs & Stratton Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Briggs & Stratton
Corporation (a Wisconsin Corporation) and subsidiaries, as of June 30, 2002, and
the related consolidated statement of earnings, shareholders' investment and
cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The consolidated
financial statements of Briggs & Stratton Corporation as of July 1, 2001 and
for the years ended July 1, 2001 and July 2, 2000 were audited by other
auditors who have ceased operations. Those other auditors expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements in their report
dated July 26, 2001.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such 2002 financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Briggs & Stratton Corporation and
subsidiaries, as of June 30, 2002, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

To the Shareholders of Briggs & Stratton Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Briggs & Stratton
Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2002, and for the year then ended
and have issued our report thereon dated August 1, 2002; such report is included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audit also included the consolidated financial
statement schedule of Briggs & Stratton Corporation for the year ended June 30,

responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion based on our audit. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic 2002 consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
