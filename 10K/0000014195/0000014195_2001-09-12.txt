                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the Company) is the world's largest producer of
air cooled gasoline engines for outdoor power equipment. The Company designs,
manufactures, markets and services these products for original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs) worldwide. These engines are primarily aluminum alloy
gasoline engines ranging from 3 through 25 horsepower.

Additionally, through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Generac Portable
Products, Inc. (Generac), acquired on May 15, 2001, the Company is a leading
designer, manufacturer and marketer of portable generators, pressure washers and
related accessories.

Since its acquisition of Generac, the Company conducts its operations in two
reportable segments: engines and Generac Portable Products. Further information
about the Company's business segments is contained in Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

ENGINES

GENERAL

The Company's engines are used primarily by the lawn and garden equipment
industry, which accounted for 84% of fiscal 2001 OEM engine sales. Major lawn
and garden equipment applications include walk-behind lawn mowers, riding lawn
mowers and garden tillers. The remaining 16% of OEM sales in fiscal 2001 were
for use on many products for industrial, construction, agricultural and consumer
applications, including generators, pumps and pressure washers. Many retailers
specify the Company's engines on the powered equipment they sell and the Briggs
& Stratton name is often featured prominently on a product despite the fact that
the engine is just a component. Briggs & Stratton engines are marketed under
various brand names including Classic(TM), Sprint(TM), Quattro(TM), Quantum(R),
INTEK(TM), I/C(R), Industrial Plus(TM) and Vanguard(TM).

In fiscal 2001, approximately 25% of the Company's net sales were derived from
sales in international markets, primarily to customers in Europe. Briggs &
Stratton serves its key international markets through its European regional
office in Switzerland, its distribution center in the Netherlands and sales and
service subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, France,
Germany, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The
Company is a leading supplier of gasoline engines in developed countries where
there is an established lawn and garden equipment market. The Company also
exports engines to developing nations where its engines are used in
agricultural, marine, construction and other applications.

Briggs & Stratton engines are sold primarily by its worldwide sales force
through direct calls on customers. The Company's marketing staff and engineers
in the United States provide support and technical assistance to its sales
force.

Briggs & Stratton also manufactures replacement engines and service parts and
sells them to sales and service distributors. The Company owns its principal
international distributors. In the United States the distributors are
independently owned and operated. These distributors supply service parts and
replacement engines directly to approximately 34,000 independently owned,
authorized service dealers throughout the world. These distributors and service
dealers implement Briggs & Stratton's commitment to reliability and service.

CUSTOMERS

The Company's engine sales are made primarily to original equipment
manufacturers. The Company's three largest engine customers in each of the last
three fiscal years were AB Electrolux (principally its Electrolux Home Products
group), MTD Products Inc. and the Murray Group (owned by Summersong Investments,
Inc.). Sales to each of these customers were more than 10% of net sales in
fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999. Sales to all three combined were 46% of net sales
in fiscal 2001, 44% of net sales in fiscal 2000 and 42% of net sales in fiscal
1999. Under purchasing plans available




                                       1
<PAGE>   4

to all of its gasoline engine customers, the Company typically enters into
annual engine supply arrangements with these large customers. The Company has no
reason to anticipate a change in this practice.

Over the past several years, sales in the United States of lawn and garden
equipment by mass merchandisers have increased significantly, while sales by
independent distributors and dealers have declined. The Company believes that in
fiscal 2001 more than 75% of all lawn and garden equipment sold in the United
States was sold through mass merchandisers such as Sears, The Home Depot, Inc.
(The Home Depot), Wal*Mart Stores, Inc. and Lowe's Home Centers, Inc. (Lowe's).
Given the buying power of the mass merchandisers, the Company, through its
customers, has continued to experience pricing pressure. The Company expects
that this pricing trend will continue in the foreseeable future. The Company
believes that a similar trend has developed for engine products for industrial
and consumer applications outside of the lawn and garden market.

COMPETITION

The small gasoline engine industry is highly competitive. The Company's major
domestic competitors in engine manufacturing are Tecumseh Products Company
(Tecumseh), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (Honda), Kohler Co. and Kawasaki Heavy
Industries, Ltd. (Kawasaki). Also, a domestic lawn mower manufacturer, Toro Co.
under its Lawn-Boy brand, manufactures some of their own engines. Eight Japanese
small engine manufacturers, of which Honda and Kawasaki are the largest, compete
directly with the Company in world markets in the sale of engines to other OEMs
and indirectly through their sale of end products. Tecumseh Europa S.p.A.,
located in Italy, is a major competitor in Europe.

The Company believes the major areas of competition from all engine
manufacturers include product quality, brand strength, price, timely delivery
and service. Other factors affecting competition are short-term market share
objectives, short-term profit objectives, exchange rate fluctuations, technology
and product support and distribution strength. Briggs & Stratton believes its
product value and service reputation have given it strong brand name recognition
and enhance its competitive position.

SEASONALITY OF DEMAND

Sales of engines to lawn and garden equipment manufacturers are highly seasonal
because of the buying patterns of retail customers. The majority of lawn and
garden equipment is sold during the spring and summer months when most lawn care
and gardening activities are performed. Sales of lawn and garden equipment are
also influenced by weather conditions. Sales in the Company's fiscal third
quarter have historically been the highest, while sales in the first fiscal
quarter have historically been the lowest.

In order to efficiently use its capital investments and meet seasonal demand for
engines, the Company pursues a relatively balanced production schedule
throughout the year, subject to ongoing adjustment to reflect changes in
estimated demand, customer inventory levels and other matters outside the
control of the Company. Accordingly, inventory levels are generally higher
during the first and second fiscal quarters in anticipation of increased
customer demand in the third fiscal quarter, at which time inventory levels
begin to decrease as sales increase. This seasonal pattern, which results in
high inventories and low cash flow for the Company in the second and the
beginning of the third fiscal quarters, shifts ultimately to higher cash flow in
the latter portion of the third fiscal quarter and in the fourth fiscal quarter
as inventories are liquidated and receivables are collected.

MANUFACTURING

Briggs & Stratton manufactures engines and parts at the following locations in
the United States: Wauwatosa, Wisconsin; Murray, Kentucky; Poplar Bluff and
Rolla, Missouri; Auburn, Alabama; and Statesboro, Georgia. The Company has a
parts distribution center in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.



                                       2

<PAGE>   5

Briggs & Stratton manufactures a majority of the structural components used in
its engines, including aluminum die castings and a high percentage of other
major components, such as carburetors and ignition systems. The Company
purchases certain parts such as piston rings, spark plugs, valves, ductile and
grey iron castings, zinc die castings and plastic components, some stampings and
screw machine parts and smaller quantities of other components. Raw material
purchases are principally aluminum and steel. The Company believes its sources
of supply are adequate.

The Company has joint ventures with Daihatsu Motor Company for the manufacture
of engines in Japan, with Puling Machinery Works and Yimin Machinery Plant for
the production of engines in China and with Starting Industrial of Japan for the
production of rewind starters in the U.S. The Company also has a joint venture
in India with Hero Motors, part of the Hero Group, for the manufacture of
engines and transmissions for use in two wheel transportation vehicles.

The Company has a strategic relationship with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI)
for the global distribution of air cooled gasoline engines manufactured by MHI
in Japan under the Company's Vanguard(TM) brand.

GENERAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS

GENERAL

In May 2001, Briggs & Stratton Corporation acquired Generac (the company).
Generac's two principal product lines are portable generators and pressure
washers. The company sells its products through multiple channels of retail
distribution, including the leading home center chains, mass merchants and
warehouse clubs as well as independent dealers. Generac or its predecessor has
been a major supplier of portable generators to Sears since 1961 and is a major
supplier to Sears of pressure washers, both marketed under the Craftsman(TM)
label. The company is also a core supplier of portable generators and pressure
washers, both marketed under the Generac Portable Products label, to The Home
Depot and Lowe's. In addition, the company is a core supplier for many of the
leading retail home centers and do-it-yourself retailers throughout the United
States, Canada and Europe.

The company sells its products to mass merchants, home centers and independent
dealers who sell to consumers. Generac has assembled a comprehensive after-sales
service network in North America for portable generators and pressure washers
comprised of approximately 3,000 authorized independent dealers. Although most
independent dealers do not generate the traffic to be competitive with mass
merchants, home centers or warehouse clubs, Generac continues to maintain its
independent dealer network for the express purpose of providing the after sales
service capability that supports its products.

To support the company's European power generator business, local sales offices
have been established in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain.

CUSTOMERS

The company sells to consumer home centers and warehouse clubs, as well as mass
merchants, hardware stores and outdoor power equipment dealers. Historically,
the major customers have been Costco, The Home Depot and Sears. Other U.S.
retail customers include B.J.'s Wholesale Club, Lowe's, Sam's Club and Tru-Serv
Incorporated.

COMPETITION

The U.S. engine powered tools industry has experienced significant consolidation
over the last 10 to 15 years. The number of competitors in its product
categories has decreased from approximately 20 in 1985 to approximately 10
today, of which only four companies have national distribution capabilities. The
principal competitive factors in the engine powered tools industry include
price, service, product performance, technical innovation and delivery. In the
manufacture and sale of




                                       3

<PAGE>   6

portable generators, Generac competes primarily with Coleman Powermate (a
division of The Coleman Company, Inc.) and Honda. In the manufacture and sale of
pressure washers, Generac competes primarily with DeVilbiss Air Power Company
(an affiliate of Pentair, Inc.) and to a lesser extent, with The Coleman
Company, Inc., Alfred Karcher GmbH & Co. and Campbell Hausfeld (an affiliate of
Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.).

The company believes it has the largest North American market share of portable
generators and a significant share of consumer pressure washers.

SEASONALITY OF DEMAND

Sales of Generac's products are subject to seasonal patterns. Due to seasonal
and regional weather factors, sales of pressure washers and related working
capital requirements are typically higher during the fiscal third and fourth
quarters than at other times of the year. Sales of generators are typically
higher during the summer storm season. The residential and commercial
construction markets are sensitive to cyclical changes in the economy.

MANUFACTURING

Generac's manufacturing location in the United States is in Jefferson,
Wisconsin. In this facility the company primarily produces portable generators
and pressure washers. Generac manufactures core components for portable
generators and pressure washers, including alternators and pressure washer
pumps, where such integration improves operating profitability by providing
lower costs.

Generac purchases engines from its parent, Briggs & Stratton Corporation, as
well as from Generac Power Systems, Inc., Tecumseh and Honda. The company has
not experienced any difficulty obtaining necessary purchased components.

To service Generac's European customer base more effectively, the company
designs and assembles its European products in its Cheshire, England facility.
This facility imports alternators, engines and other components and assembles
portable generators to meet European product requirements.

CONSOLIDATED

GENERAL INFORMATION

The Company holds certain patents on features incorporated in its products;
however, the success of the Company's business is not considered to be primarily
dependent upon patent protection. Licenses, franchises and concessions are not a
material factor in the Company's business.

For the years ending July 1, 2001, July 2, 2000 and June 27, 1999, the Company
spent approximately $21.5 million, $24.3 million and $17.9 million,
respectively, on Company sponsored research activities relating to the
development of new products or the improvement of existing products.

The average number of persons employed by the Company during the fiscal year was
7,160. Employment ranged from a low of 6,447 in May 2001 to a high of 7,489 in
October 2000.

EXPORT SALES

Export sales for fiscal 2001 were $325.6 million (25% of total sales), for
fiscal 2000 were $358.1 million (23% of total sales) and for fiscal 1999 were
$316.1 million (21% of total sales). These sales were principally to customers
in European countries. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for financial information about geographic areas. Also, see Item 7A and Note 12
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the
Company's foreign exchange risk management.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The corporate offices and one of the Company's engine manufacturing facilities
are located in a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Company also has engine
manufacturing facilities in Murray, Kentucky; Poplar Bluff and Rolla, Missouri;
Auburn, Alabama and Statesboro, Georgia. These are owned facilities containing
3.6 million square feet of office and production area. The Company occupies
warehouse space totalling 400,000 square feet in a suburb of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin under a reservation of interest agreement. The Company also leases
80,000 square feet of engine component manufacturing space in the Milwaukee
area.

Generac's offices and one of its manufacturing facilities are located in
Jefferson, Wisconsin. Generac also has a manufacturing facility in Cheshire,
England. These are owned facilities containing 295,000 square feet of office and
production area. Generac leases warehouse space totalling 270,000 square feet in
5 communities in Wisconsin.

The engine business with the OEMs is seasonal, with demand for engines at its
height in the winter and early spring. Engine manufacturing operations run at
capacity levels during the peak season, with many operations running three
shifts. Engine operations generally run fewer shifts in the summer, when demand
is weakest and production is considerably under capacity. During the winter,
when finished goods inventories reach their highest levels, owned warehouse
space may be insufficient and capacity may be expanded through rented space.
Excess warehouse space exists in the spring and summer seasons.

The Company leases approximately 207,000 square feet of space to house its
foreign sales and service operations in Australia, Austria, Canada, China, the
Czech Republic, France, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia,
South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and the United
Kingdom.

The Company's owned properties are well maintained. The Company believes that
its owned and leased facilities are adequate to perform its operations in a
reasonable manner.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

There are no pending legal proceedings that are required to be reported under
this item.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the three months ended July 1,
2001.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
MATTERS

Information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to
"Quarterly Financial Data, Dividend and Market Information" on page 35.

Private Offering of Convertible Senior Notes. On May 14, 2001, Briggs & Stratton
Corporation issued and sold, in a private placement, $140 million aggregate
principal amount of its 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 15, 2006. The
convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holders into shares of
Briggs & Stratton common stock, at any time prior to their maturity or
redemption, at the conversion rate of 20.1846 shares of common stock per $1,000
principal amount of convertible notes, subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances. This is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $49.54
per share.

The convertible notes were sold to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Banc of America
Securities LLC, as "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501 under
the Securities Act of 1933, in reliance on the exemption from registration
afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for transactions by an issuer not
involving any public offering, and were offered and sold by the initial
purchasers to "qualified institutional buyers" in reliance on Rule 144A under
the Securities Act. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in
connection with the private offering, Briggs & Stratton has filed a shelf
registration statement to permit the registered resale of the convertible notes
and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes.

The aggregate offering price of the convertible notes was $140 million, 100% of
the principal amount thereof. The purchase price paid to the Company by the
initial purchasers was the initial offering price less an underwriting discount
of $3.675 million, 2.625% of the principal amount of the convertible notes.

Concurrently with the offering of the convertible notes, the Company offered and
sold $275 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.875% Senior Notes due
March 15, 2011, which are not convertible, in a private placement to the same
initial purchasers for offering to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A, with exchange and registration rights.

The net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes and convertible senior notes
were used to fund the acquisition of Generac, including the replacement of
Generac's outstanding debt, and to repay a portion of our unrated commercial
paper and short-term borrowings under our credit facilities. The senior notes
and the convertible senior notes are guaranteed by Generac and its subsidiaries.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

Acquisition

On May 15, 2001, the Company acquired Generac Portable Products for net cash of
$267 million. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on the acquisition.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000

Sales

Net sales for fiscal 2001 totaled $1,312 million, a decrease of $280 million or
18% compared to the preceding year. The primary factors were a 10% decline in
engine unit volume, 15% lower sales of service components due to the Company's
distributors having adequate stocks of parts, and an unfavorable sales mix as
the entire 10% engine unit decline was made up of larger horsepower engines.
Inventories of riding equipment at the OEMs and retail were more than adequate
to address soft demand for riding lawn and garden equipment.

The other major factor adversely affecting the fiscal year was the weak Euro
which lowered revenues by $24 million. These revenues decreased because the
Company's pricing reflected the need to remain competitive in the European
market.

The acquisition of Generac added $30 million in sales.

Gross Profit

The gross profit rate decreased to 18% from 21% in fiscal 2000. The major
reasons for the decrease were lower plant utilization having a $32 million
impact and the weak Euro of $24 million. Offsetting these factors was the
favorable pension income impact of $12 million. Pension income included in gross
profit totaled $24 million in fiscal 2001.

Engineering, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6 million
or 4% compared to fiscal 2000. Expenses in this category increased almost $20
million. The majority of the increase was due to the following factors: a $16
million planned expansion of staff and expenditures for business development and
introduction of new product, a $3 million bad debt write-off, and $3 million of
Generac's operating costs incurred since the acquisition. The increased costs
were offset by $14 million of lower employee benefit costs for profit sharing
and increased pension income. Pension income in this category was $4 million in
fiscal 2001.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $9 million or 44% in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal
2000 because the level of borrowings was greater in fiscal 2001. The increased
level of borrowings resulted from increased seasonal working capital needs and
the funding of the Generac acquisition.

Other Income

Other income decreased $13 million in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. This
decrease is attributed primarily to an $8 million reduction in equity income
from joint ventures and investments and $5 million in translation losses.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate decreased to 33.2% in fiscal 2001 from 37.0% in the
previous year. The majority of the decrease was the result of the finalization
and approval by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation of a refund on our
Federal taxes related to Foreign Sales Corporation tax benefits.

FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999

Sales

Net sales for fiscal 2000 totaled $1,593 million, an increase of $89 million or
6% compared to the preceding year. The primary factors were a $104 million
increase in sales dollars related to a 6% increase in engine unit shipments, a
favorable mix of engines sold amounting to $24 million and $9 million from
increased prices. Offsetting these factors was a $48 million decrease of
castings sales resulting from the disposition of the Company's ductile iron
foundries in the first quarter of fiscal 2000.

Gross Profit

The gross profit rate increased to 21% in fiscal 2000 from 20% in fiscal 1999.
Favorable factors to the gross profit were $18 million attributed to the benefit
of higher production during the year and $9 million of price increases.
Offsetting these improvements were $6 million of higher costs for purchased
items including increased costs for imported engines due to currency exchange
rates.

Engineering, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $9 million
or 7% compared to fiscal 1999. This increase was primarily from a $6 million
increase in research and development costs and a $3 million increase in profit
sharing expenses due to improved results. These increases were offset by a $2
million decrease in costs related to the Company's POWERCOM software business
that was sold in the first quarter of the preceding year.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $4 million or 25% in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal
1999. These increases were the result of the Company's higher level of
short-term borrowings during the year to fund working capital needs.

Gain on Disposition of Foundry Assets

At the end of August 1999, the Company contributed its two ductile iron
foundries to Metal Technologies Holding Company, Inc. (MTHC) in exchange for $24
million in cash and $45 million aggregate par value convertible preferred stock.
The provisions of the preferred stock include a 15% cumulative dividend and
conversion rights into a minimum of 31% of MTHC common stock. Pursuant to
Emerging Issues Task Force Abstract No. 86-29, the Company considered this
contribution to be a monetary transaction, given the significant amount of cash
received and recorded the consideration received at fair value. The preferred
stock received was determined to have a fair value of $22 million based on
provisions of the stock and the prevailing market returns for similar
investments, estimated to be 30%, as of the date of the transaction.

Other Income

Other income increased $9 million in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999. This
increase is primarily attributed to increased equity income from joint ventures.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate used in fiscal 2000 was 37.0% compared with 37.5% in
fiscal 1999.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

FISCAL YEARS 2001, 2000 AND 1999

Cash flow from operating activities was $68 million, $77 million and $116
million, in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The fiscal 2001 cash flow from operating activities decreased $10 million, which
reflects lower gains on the disposition of plant and equipment of $16 million.
The lower gains from disposition of plant and equipment were because fiscal 2000
contained the disposition of the foundry assets. The increase in inventories was
$114 million less in fiscal 2001 compared to the fiscal 2000 increase. This
decrease was the result of planned inventory increases in fiscal 2000 to
replenish abnormally low inventories to more normal levels. The change in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities was $48 million less in fiscal 2001 due
to timing of payments and lack of accruals for profit sharing due to lower
performance. The $18 million increase in pension income is attributable to the
Company's over funded pension plan.

The fiscal 2000 cash flow from operating activities decreased $38 million. This
reflects increased net income of $30 million offset by the gain on disposition
of foundry assets of $17 million and an increased requirement for operating
capital of $41 million caused by increases in inventories at the end of fiscal
2000 offset by lower accounts receivable. The increase in inventories was
planned as inventories at the end of fiscal 1999 were unusually low. Lower
accounts receivable was caused by lower sales in June 2000 compared to June
1999.

The fiscal 1999 cash flow from operating activities declined $20 million. This
reflects improved net income of $35 million, offset by an increased requirement
for operating capital of $49 million, caused primarily by strong fourth quarter
business which increased year-end receivables and a restoration of inventories
to higher year-end levels.

Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $318 million, $43 million and
$67 million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These cash flows
included additions to plant and equipment of $61 million, $71 million and $66
million in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Fiscal 2001 and 1999
capital expenditures relate primarily to reinvestment in equipment and new
products. The fiscal 2000 capital expenditures related primarily to reinvestment
in equipment, capacity additions and new products. The fiscal 2001 cash used in
investing activities includes $267 million of cash paid for the Generac
acquisition net of cash acquired. The fiscal 2000 cash used in investing
activities is net of $24 million of proceeds received on the disposition of
plant and equipment.




                                       11
<PAGE>   14



Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $324 million in fiscal
2001. In fiscal 2000 and 1999 cash used by financing activities was $77 million
and $73 million, respectively. Fiscal 2001 included $399 million of proceeds
received from issuing the 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2006 and the 8.875%
Senior Notes due 2011 to fund the acquisition of Generac and payment of short
term-borrowings. During fiscal 2000, the Company repaid the remaining $30
million on the 9.21% Senior Notes due 2001. There was no gain or loss associated
with this repayment. In fiscal 1999 the Company paid $15 million on these notes.
Proceeds from the exercise of stock options amounted to $45 million in fiscal
1999, substantially higher than in fiscal 2001 and 2000. Also, the Company
repurchased fewer common shares in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 and 1999.

Future Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company has in place a $250 million revolving credit facility to be used to
fund seasonal working capital requirements and other financing needs. While this
credit facility expires in April 2002, the Company is currently negotiating its
replacement and expects to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal
2002. This facility and the Company's other indebtedness contain certain
restrictive covenants, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company expects capital expenditures to be $67 million for fiscal 2002.
These anticipated expenditures are for continued investments in equipment and
new products.

Management believes that available cash, the credit facility, cash generated
from operations, existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be
adequate to fund the Company's capital requirements for the foreseeable future.

FINANCIAL STRATEGY

Management of the Company subscribes to the premise that the value of the
Company is enhanced if the capital invested in the Company's operations yields a
cash return that is greater than the Company's cost of capital. Given this
belief, the Company implemented this financial strategy by means of a "dutch
auction" tender offer and a public debt offering in fiscal 1997. The Company
also continued the repurchase of its outstanding common stock in the open market
in fiscal years 1998 through 2001. The Company believes this will provide a
capital structure that makes greater use of financial leverage without imposing
excessive risk on either the Company's shareholders or creditors. The Company
also believes that the substitution of lower (after-tax) cost debt for equity in
its permanent capital structure will reduce its overall cost of capital and that
its profitability and strong cash flows will accommodate the increased use of
debt without impairing its ability to finance growth or increase cash dividends
per share on its common stock.

The Company has remaining authorization to buy up to 1.8 million shares of
company stock in open market or private transactions under the June 2000 Board
of Directors' authorization to repurchase up to 2.0 million shares. The Company
does not anticipate repurchasing shares in fiscal 2002.

Also as a part of its financial strategy, subject to the discretion of its Board
of Directors and the requirements of applicable law and debt covenants, the
Company currently intends to increase future cash dividends per share at a rate
approximating the inflation rate.

OUTLOOK

The Company projects sales to increase by almost 30% in fiscal 2002. A majority
of the increase is because Generac's sales will be in the numbers for a full
year at approximately $310 million. Engine sales are anticipated to increase 7%
due to engine volume, sales mix and some new products and services.

The gross profit percentage is projected to be approximately 17.5% for the
year. This is down from fiscal 2001, because of the weighting of Generac sales
which are projected to have lower gross margins than the Company's engine
business. The other negative impact on gross margins is the anticipated lower
engine production between years and the new product and service introductions
that are projected to have negative margins during startup.

Engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses are projected to
increase from $140 million to $165 million. Generac's expenses in this category
are $24 million of the anticipated $25 million increase.

Interest expense is anticipated to be $45 million, depreciation $60 million and
capital expenditures $67 million. The Company currently expects to have an
effective tax rate of 35.0%.

The Company anticipates the first quarter operating results to be significantly
lower than the prior years, due to slower sales and significantly lower
production levels. The Company expects both sales and production levels to peak
in a more historical pattern in fiscal 2002, which is basically late in the
second fiscal quarter and then during the full third fiscal quarter.

OTHER MATTERS

General

On October 5, 2000, it was announced that one of the Company's largest
customers, the Murray Group, was acquired by Summersong Investments, Inc. The
Company does not expect this acquisition to adversely impact its annual supply
arrangement with the Murray Group for the fiscal 2002 outdoor power equipment
selling season, as there was no adverse impact in fiscal 2001.

In July 2001, the Company extended its collective bargaining agreement with one
of its unions. This agreement expires in 2006, and contains provisions for
future wage increases, medical cost sharing and increased pension benefits.

Emissions

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed national emission
standards under a two phase process for small air cooled engines. The Company
currently has a complete product offering which complies with EPA's Phase I
engine emission standards. The EPA finalized its Phase II emission standards in
March of 1999. The Phase II program will impose more stringent standards over
the useful life of the engine and will be phased in from 2001 to 2005 for Class
II (225 or greater cubic centimeter displacement) engines and from 2003 to 2008
for Class I (under 225 cubic centimeter displacement) engines. The Company does
not believe compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse
effect on its financial position or results of operations.

The Company implemented a supplemental compliance plan for model years 2000 and
2001 with the California Air Resources Board (CARB), as required of companies
which sell more than a threshold number of Class I engines into California. The
objective of the plans is to achieve additional reductions in extreme
non-attainment areas. While CARB's aggressive program resulted in a reduced
product offering by the Company in California, the California program did not
have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of
the Company.

New Accounting Pronouncements

The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Abstract No. 00-10,
"Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs", and EITF Abstract No.
00-22, "Accounting for Points and Certain Time-Based and Volume-Based Sales
Incentive Offers and Offers for Free Products or Services to be Delivered in the
Future". These were adopted during fiscal 2001. The impact of adopting of EITF
No. 00-10 was to reclassify approximately $2 million of shipping revenue from
cost of sales into revenue in each of fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999. There was no
impact of adopting EITF No. 00-22.

EITF Abstract No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statements Characterization of
Consideration Paid to a Re-Seller of a Vendor's Products", is to be adopted as
of December 31, 2001. The Company will be required to reclassify co-op
advertising expense from selling expense to sales as a reduction of gross sales.
The reclassification will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS
No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". SFAS No. 141 provides for the
elimination of the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business
combinations with an acquisition date of July 1, 2001 or later. SFAS No. 142
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives and requires periodic reassessment of the underlying value of
such assets for impairment. SFAS No. 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. An early adoption provision exists for companies with
fiscal years beginning after March 15, 2001. On July 2, 2001, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 142. Application of the nonamortization provision of SFAS No.
142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of approximately $.7
million in fiscal 2002.

ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and
interest rates. To reduce the risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, the
Company selectively uses financial instruments. The Company does not hold or
issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

The Company's earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S.
dollar against the Japanese Yen and Euro. The Yen is used to purchase engines
from the Company's joint venture, while the Company receives Euros for certain
products sold to European customers. The Company's foreign subsidiaries'
earnings are also influenced by fluctuations of the local currency against the
U.S. dollar as these subsidiaries purchase inventory from the parent in U.S.
dollars. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to partially hedge against
the earnings effects of such fluctuations. At July 1, 2001, the Company had the
following forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with the Fair Value
Gains (Losses) shown (in thousands):

British Pounds       682    1,921    Australian     (15)

</TABLE>



All of the above contracts expire within twelve months.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the shareholders'
investment in the Company. Amounts invested in the Company's non-U.S.
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at
year end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders'
investment as cumulative translation adjustments. The cumulative translation
adjustments component of shareholders' investment decreased $2.5 million during
the year. Using the year-end exchange rates, the total amount invested in
non-U.S. subsidiaries at July 1, 2001 was approximately $21.7 million.

INTEREST RATES

The Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings. The
Company manages its interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and
variable rate debt. Depending on general economic conditions, the Company has
typically used variable rate debt for short-term borrowings and fixed rate debt
for longer-term borrowings.

At July 1, 2001, the Company had the following short-term loans outstanding
(amounts in thousands):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JULY 1, 2001, JULY 2, 2000 AND JUNE 27, 1999

(1) NATURE OF OPERATIONS:

Briggs & Stratton Corporation (the Company) is a U.S. based producer of air
cooled gasoline engines. These engines are sold worldwide, primarily to original
equipment manufacturers of lawn and garden equipment and other gasoline engine
powered equipment. Additionally, through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,
Generac Portable Products, Inc., the company is a designer, manufacturer and
marketer of portable generators, pressure washers and related accessories.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Fiscal Year: The Company's fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the
Sunday nearest the last day of June in each year. Therefore, the 2001 fiscal
year was 52 weeks long, the 2000 fiscal year was 53 weeks long and the 1999
fiscal year was 52 weeks long. All references to years relate to fiscal years
rather than calendar years.

Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Briggs & Stratton Corporation and its wholly owned domestic and
foreign subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions.

Accounting Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents: This caption includes cash, commercial paper and
certificates of deposit. The Company considers all highly liquid investments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories: Inventories are stated at cost, which does not exceed market. The
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method was used for determining the cost of
approximately 77% of total inventories at July 1, 2001, 91% of total inventories
at July 2, 2000 and 89% at June 27, 1999. The cost for the remaining portion of
the inventories was determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. If
the FIFO inventory valuation method had been used exclusively, inventories would
have been $51.2 million, $45.2 million and $43.9 million higher in the
respective years. The LIFO inventory adjustment was determined on an overall
basis, and accordingly, each class of inventory reflects an allocation based on
the FIFO amounts.

Investments: This caption represents the Company's investments in four 50%-owned
foreign joint ventures, preferred stock in a privately-held iron castings
business and common stock in a publicly traded software company. The common
stock in the publicly traded company is being classified as available-for-sale
and is reported at a fair market value of $.5 million as of July 1, 2001, $2.1
million as of July 2, 2000 and $2.7 million as of June 27, 1999. The unrealized
loss incurred on this stock is recorded as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
in the Shareholders' Investment section of the balance sheet. The investments in
the joint ventures and the privately held business are accounted for under the
equity method.

Deferred Loan Costs: Expenses associated with the issuance of debt instruments
are capitalized and are being amortized over the terms of the respective
financing arrangement using the effective interest rate method over periods
ranging from five to ten years.

Capitalized Software: This caption represents costs of software used in the
Company's business. Amortization of Capitalized Software is computed on an
item-by-item basis over a period of three to ten years, depending on the
estimated useful life of the software. Accumulated amortization amounted to $7.4
million as of July 1, 2001, $6.2 million as of July 2, 2000 and $5.7 million as
of June 27, 1999.

Intangible Assets: This caption represents primarily goodwill, the recognized
portion of the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair values assigned to
identifiable net assets acquired which is amortized on a straight-line basis
over twenty years and other identifiable intangible assets, which are amortized



                                       20

<PAGE>   23

NOTES...

on a straight-line basis over periods of six to seven years. As of July 1, 2001,
accumulated amortization was $1.1 million. The Company assesses the carrying
value of goodwill and other intangibles for possible impairment at each balance
sheet date.

Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: Plant and equipment are stated at cost and
depreciation is computed using the straight-line method at rates based upon the
estimated useful lives of the assets.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which significantly extend the
useful lives of existing plant and equipment, are capitalized and depreciated.
Upon retirement or disposition of plant and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in other income.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Property, plant and equipment and other
long-term assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the
sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of
the related asset or group of assets, a loss is recognized for the difference
between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets. There
were no adjustments to the carrying value of long-lived assets in fiscal 2001.

Revenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when title to the products being sold
transfers to the customer, which is generally upon shipment. The impact of Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements", did
not have an impact on the results of operations.

Deferred Revenue on Sale of Plant & Equipment: In fiscal 1997, the Company sold
its Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin facility for approximately $16.0 million. The
provisions of the contract state that the Company will continue to own and
occupy the warehouse portion of the facility for a period of up to ten years
(the Reservation Period). The contract also contains a buyout clause, at the
buyer's option and under certain circumstances, of the remaining Reservation
Period. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real
Estate," the Company is required to account for this as a financing transaction
as the Company continues to have substantial involvement with the facility
during the Reservation Period or until the buyout option is exercised. Under
this method, the cash received is reflected as a deferred revenue and the assets
and the accumulated depreciation remain on the Company's books. Depreciation
expense continues to be recorded each period and imputed interest expense is
also recorded and added to deferred revenue. Offsetting this is the imputed fair
value lease income on the non-Company occupied portion of the building. A pretax
gain, which will be recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the buyout
option or the expiration of the Reservation Period, is estimated to be $10
million to $12 million. The annual cost of operating the warehouse portion of
the facility is not material.

Income Taxes: The Provision for Income Taxes includes Federal, state and foreign
income taxes currently payable and those deferred or prepaid because of
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets
and liabilities. The Future Income Tax Benefits represent temporary differences
relating to current assets and current liabilities and the Deferred Income Tax
Assets/Liabilities represent temporary differences relating to noncurrent assets
and liabilities.

Research and Development Costs: Expenditures relating to the development of new
products and processes, including significant improvements and refinements to
existing products, are expensed as incurred. The amounts charged against income
were $21.5 million in 2001, $24.3 million in 2000 and $17.9 million in 1999.

Advertising Costs: Advertising costs, included in Engineering, Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Earnings, are expensed as incurred. These expenses totaled $10.1 million in
2001, $8.1 million in 2000 and $7.7 million in 1999.




                                       21

NOTES...

EITF Abstract No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statements Characterization of
Consideration Paid to a Re-Seller of a Vendor's Products", is to be adopted as
of December 31, 2001. The Company will be required to reclassify co-op
advertising expense from selling expense to sales as a reduction of gross sales.
The reclassification will not have a material adverse effect on results of
operations.

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: During the fourth quarter of 2001, the
company adopted the provisions of the EITF Abstract No. 00-10, "Accounting for
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs." In accordance with EITF No. 00-10,
revenue received from shipping and handling fees is reflected in net sales. The
reclassification of shipping fee revenue out of cost of sales for the years
ended July 1, 2001, July 2, 2000 and June 27, 1999 was $1.7 million, $2.0
million and $2.2 million respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation: Foreign currency balance sheet accounts are
translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at
fiscal year end. Income and expenses are translated at the average rates of
exchange in effect during the year. The related translation adjustments are made
directly to a separate component of Shareholders' Investment.

Earnings Per Share: The Company's earnings per share were computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share, for each period presented, were
computed on the assumption that stock options were exercised at the beginning of
the periods reported. The difference between weighted average shares outstanding
and diluted average shares outstanding reflects the dilutive effects of stock
options and the convertible senior notes. The Company's share repurchase program
may affect the year-to-date comparisons.

The shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share for fiscal
2001, 2000 and 1999 excluded outstanding options to purchase 1,679,564,
1,079,564 and 348,530 shares of common stock, respectively, with
weighted-average exercise prices of $56.33, $61.95 and $61.90, respectively. The
options were excluded because their exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of the common shares and their inclusion in the computation
would have been antidulitive.

Comprehensive Income: Comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial
reporting method that includes disclosure of certain financial information that
historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income. The
Company has chosen to report Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss) which encompasses net income, unrealized gain (loss)
on marketable securities, foreign currency translation, and unrealized gain on
derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Investment.
Information on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is as follows (in
thousands of dollars):

NOTES...

Derivatives: On July 2, 2000, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". This statement requires
companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities,
measured at fair value. Any changes in fair value of these instruments are
recorded in the income statement or other comprehensive income. The impact of
adopting SFAS No. 133 on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss resulted in a loss
of $15 thousand. The Company reclassified derivative gains of $1.8 million to
the income statement during the fiscal year. The cumulative effect of adopting
SFAS No. 133 on the results of operations was immaterial.

The Company enters into derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to
manage its foreign currency exposures. These instruments generally do not have a
maturity of more than twelve months. During the fiscal year, there were no
derivative instruments that were deemed to be ineffective. The amounts included
in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into income when
the forecasted transaction occurs, generally within the next twelve months.
These forecasted transactions represent the exporting of products for which the
Company will receive foreign currency and the importing of products for which
the Company will be required to pay in a foreign currency.

Sales Incentives: In January 2001, EITF Abstract No. 00-22 "Accounting for
'Points' and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers and
Offers for Free Products or Services to be Delivered in the Future" was issued.
EITF No. 00-22 prescribes guidance requiring certain rebate offers and free
products that are delivered subsequent to a single exchange transaction to be
recognized when incurred and reported as a reduction of revenue. The Company
adopted EITF No. 00-22 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. It did not impact
the results of operations because the Company's past and current accounting
policy is to report such costs as reductions of revenue.

Reclassification: Certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Business Combinations: In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets" having a required effective date for fiscal years
beginning after December 31, 2001. Under certain circumstances companies are
permitted to adopt these statements before the required date. Under the new
rules, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will
no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in
accordance with the Statements. Other intangible assets will continue to be
amortized over their useful lives.

The Company adopted the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Application of the
nonamortization provisions of the SFAS No. 142 is expected to result in an
increase in net income of approximately $.7 million in fiscal 2002. The Company
will perform the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets during fiscal 2002.

(3) ACQUISITION:

On May 15, 2001, the Company acquired Generac, a designer, manufacturer and
marketer of portable generators, pressure washers and related accessories. The
aggregate purchase price of $288.1 million included $267.6 million of cash and
$20.5 million of liabilities assumed. The cash paid included $.5 million of cash
acquired and $4.5 million of direct acquisition costs, and was funded through
the issuance of the 8.875% senior notes as more fully described in Footnote 6.

The provisions of the acquisition include a contingent purchase price based on
the operating results of Generac. The Company does not expect to pay any
additional purchase price pursuant to these provisions.

NOTES...

The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated on a preliminary basis to
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated
fair values, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. Final
adjustments to the purchase price allocation are not expected to be material to
the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill of approximately $167.7 million
has been recorded as a result of the acquisition and has been amortized on a
straight-line basis over twenty years. The following table sets forth the
unaudited pro forma information for the Company as if the acquisition of Generac
had occurred on June 28, 1999 (in millions, except per share data):

In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142. Under the
new rules, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no
longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests.

The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations. These undistributed earnings amounted to approximately $8.4 million
at July 1, 2001. If these earnings were remitted to the U.S., they would be
subject to U.S. income tax. However, this tax would be substantially less than
the U.S. statutory income tax because of available foreign tax credits.

(6) INDEBTEDNESS:

The Company has access to a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the Credit
Facility) which expires in April 2002. The Company also has access to additional
domestic lines of credit totaling $18.0 million which remain in effect until
canceled by either party. They provide amounts for short-term use at the then
prevailing rate. There are no significant compensating balance requirements for
any of these lines. There were no borrowings at July 1, 2001 using these lines
or the Credit Facility. On July 2, 2000, there were $45 million of borrowings
that were included in the domestic notes payable.

Borrowings under the Credit Facility by the Company bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to, at its option, either:
(1) the higher of (a) the bank's reference rate or (b) 0.5% per annum above the
Federal Funds rate; or
(2) LIBOR plus a margin that may be adjusted up or down based on the Company's
debt ratings. The following data relates to domestic notes payable (in thousands

</TABLE>

In May 2001 the Company issued $275.0 million of 8.875% Senior Notes due March
15, 2011 and $140.0 million of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 15, 2006.
The convertible senior notes are convertible at the option of the holders into
the Company's common stock at the conversion rate of 20.1846 shares per each
$1,000 of convertible notes. Interest is paid semi-annually on both series of
notes. No principal payments are due before the maturity dates.

The net proceeds from the sale of the 8.875% senior notes and 5.00% convertible
senior notes were used to fund the Company's acquisition of Generac including
the replacement of Generac's outstanding debt and to repay a portion of the
Company's unrated commercial paper and short-term borrowings under its credit
facilities.

The 7.25% senior notes are due September 15, 2007. No principal payments are due
before that date.

The separate indentures providing for the 7.25% senior notes, the 8.875% senior
notes and the 5.00% convertible senior notes and the Company's revolving credit
agreement (collectively, the Domestic Indebtedness) each include a number of
financial and operating restrictions. These covenants include, among other
things, restrictions on the Company's ability to: pay dividends; incur
indebtedness; create liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of its assets; and
dispose of assets or the proceeds of sales of its assets. In addition, the
revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that, among other things,
require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and that
impose a maximum leverage ratio. As of July 1, 2001, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants.

Additionally, under the terms of the indentures governing the Domestic
Indebtedness, Generac and its subsidiaries became joint and several guarantors
of amounts outstanding under the Domestic Indebtedness.

(7) SEPARATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS OF INDEBTEDNESS

Under the terms of the Company's Domestic Indebtedness as described in Footnote
6, Generac and its subsidiaries became joint and several guarantors of the
Domestic Indebtedness. Additionally, if at any time a domestic subsidiary of the
Company constitutes a significant domestic subsidiary, then such domestic
subsidiary will also become a guarantor of the Domestic Indebtedness. Each
guarantee of the Domestic Indebtedness is the obligation of the guarantor and
ranks equally and ratably with the existing and future senior unsecured
obligations of that guarantor accordingly, Generac has provided a full and
unconditional guarantee of the Domestic Indebtedness. The following condensed
supplemental consolidating financial information reflects the operations of
Generac since the acquisition date of May 15, 2001 (in thousands of dollars):

(9) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Product and general liability claims arise against the Company from time to time
in the ordinary course of business. The Company is generally self-insured for
claims up to $1 million per claim. Accordingly, a reserve is maintained for the
estimated costs of such claims. At July 1, 2001 and July 2, 2000 the reserve for
product and general liability claims was $3.6 million and $4.0 million,
respectively, based on available information. No reasonable range of possible
losses can be determined, because there is inherent uncertainty as to the
eventual resolution of unsettled claims. Management does not expect that the
likely outcome of these claims, excluding the impact of insurance proceeds and
reserves, will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company.

The Company has no material commitments for materials or capital expenditures at
July 1, 2001.

(10) STOCK OPTIONS:

The Company has a Stock Incentive Plan under which 5,361,935 shares of common
stock have been reserved for issuance. The Company accounts for the plan under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, under which no compensation cost has
been recognized. Had compensation cost for these plans been determined
consistent with SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the
Company's net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the
following pro forma amounts:

Because the SFAS No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to options
granted prior to July 2, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation cost may not
be representative of that to be expected in future years.

NOTES...

The exercise price of the 1992 grant has been adjusted as appropriate to reflect
a two-for-one stock split in October 1994 and the spin-off of the Company's lock
business in February 1995.

The fair value of each option is estimated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. The grant-date fair market value of the options and assumptions
used to determine such value are as follows:

</TABLE>

(11) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN:

On August 6, 1996, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of
one common stock purchase right (a right) for each share of the Company's common
stock outstanding on August 19, 1996. Each right would entitle shareowners to
buy one-half of one share of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of
$160.00 per full common share, subject to adjustment. The rights are not
currently exercisable, but would become exercisable if certain events occurred
relating to a person or group acquiring or attempting to acquire 15 percent or
more of the outstanding shares of common stock. The rights expire on August 19,
2006, unless redeemed or exchanged by the Company earlier.

(12) FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT:

The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge purchase commitments
denominated in foreign currencies. The term of these currency derivatives does
not exceed twelve months and the purpose is to protect the Company from the risk
that the eventual dollars being transferred will be adversely affected by
changes in exchange rates.

The Company has forward foreign currency exchange contracts to purchase 1.3
billion Japanese yen for $11.4 million through December, 2001. These contracts
are used to hedge the commitments to purchase engines from the Company's
Japanese joint venture. At July 1, 2001 the loss on these contracts at fair
value totaled $.6 million.

The Company also has forward contracts to sell 36 million Euros for $33.6
million through October, 2001. The gain on these contracts on July 1, 2001 at
fair market value totaled $3.1 million.

The Company's foreign subsidiaries have the following forward currency contracts
outstanding at the end of fiscal 2001:

</TABLE>

At July 1, 2001 the gain on these contracts at fair value
totaled $.2 million.

The Company continuously evaluates the effectiveness of its hedging program by
evaluating its foreign exchange contracts compared to the anticipated underlying
transactions.

</TABLE>

In July 2001, the Company extended its collective bargaining agreement with one
of its unions. As part of this contract extension, the Company agreed to pay
certain amounts to employees who were hired prior to January 1, 1980 upon their
retirement. The impact of this plan amendment is included in the above tables.

As described in Note 15, the Company contributed its two ductile iron foundries
to MTHC. In connection with the contribution, MTHC agreed to assume pension and
postretirement benefit obligations related to employees working at the foundries
at the time of the transaction. The Company transferred to MTHC pension assets
amounting to $11.3 million in fiscal 2001. The assumption of obligations by MTHC
and transfer of pension assets did not result in a gain or loss to the Company.

The Company's supplemental pension plan has benefit obligations in excess of
plan assets. The benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair
value of plan assets were $19.0 million, $14.9 million and $0 respectively for
the 2001 fiscal year and $17.7 million, $14.9 million and $0 respectively for
the 2000 fiscal year. The postretirement benefit plans are unfunded.

For measurement purposes a 10% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered health care claims was assumed for the year 2002 decreasing gradually to
5% for the year 2008. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a
significant effect on the amounts reported. An increase of one percentage point,
would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit by $6.7 million and would
increase the service and interest cost by $.7 million for the year. A
corresponding decrease of one percentage point, would decrease the accumulated
postretirement benefit by $6.4 million and decrease the service and interest
cost by $.6 million for the year.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan that includes most U.S.
non-Wisconsin employees. Under the plan the Company makes an annual contribution
on behalf of covered employees equal to 2% of each participant's gross income,
as defined. For the fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, the net expense related to
these plans was $.2 million, $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively.

Wisconsin employees of the Company may participate in a salary reduction
deferred compensation retirement plan. A maximum of 1-1/2% or 3% of each
participant's salary, depending upon the participant's group is matched by the
Company. Company contributions totaled $4.7 million in 2001, $4.6 million in
2000 and $4.2 million in 1999.

Postemployment Benefits

The Company accrues the expected cost of postemployment benefits over the years
that the employees render service. These benefits are substantially smaller
amounts because they apply only to employees who permanently terminate
employment prior to retirement. The items include disability payments, life
insurance and medical benefits. These amounts are also discounted using a

7.5% interest rate. Amounts are included in Accrued Employee Benefits in
the balance sheet.

(14) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents, Domestic Notes Payable and Foreign Loans: The
carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

Long-Term Debt: The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated
based on quotations made on similar issues.

The estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments are as follows
(in thousands of dollars):

(15) DISPOSITION OF BUSINESS:

At the end of August 1999, the Company contributed its two ductile iron
foundries to MTHC in exchange for $23.6 million in cash and $45.0 million
aggregate par value convertible preferred stock. The provisions of the preferred
stock include a 15% cumulative dividend and conversion rights into a minimum of
31% of MTHC common stock. Pursuant to EITF Abstract No. 86-29, the Company
considered this contribution to be a monetary transaction, given the significant
amount of cash received and recorded the consideration received at fair value.
The preferred stock received was determined to have a fair value of $21.6
million based on provisions of the stock and the prevailing market returns for
similar investments, estimated to be 30%, as of the date of the transaction.

MTHC is the primary supplier to the Company for iron castings. There are no
other material arrangements between the Company and MTHC.

Based on the above and the fair value of all consideration received, the
transaction resulted in a $16.5 million gain.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States, the consolidated financial statements included in the Briggs &
Stratton Corporation annual report to shareholders on Form 10-K, and have issued
our report thereon dated July 26, 2001. Our audit was made for the purpose of
forming an opinion on those statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in
the index in item 14(a)(2) is the responsibility of the Corporation's management
and is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. The
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
