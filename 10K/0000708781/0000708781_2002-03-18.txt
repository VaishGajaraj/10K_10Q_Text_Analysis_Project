ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Description of Business

Cass Information Systems, Inc. ("Cass" or "the Company") is a leading provider
of payment and information processing services to large manufacturing,
distribution and retail enterprises across the United States. The Company
provides freight invoice rating, payment, audit, cost accounting and
transportation information to many of the nation's largest companies. It is also
the leading processor and payer of utility invoices in the United States,
including electricity, gas, water, telephone and refuse collection. Cass
extracts, stores and presents information from freight and utility invoices,
assisting our customers' traffic and energy managers in making decisions that
will enable them to improve their operating performance. Cass utilizes web,
Internet and browser technology in all of its systems. It heavily utilizes
electronic commerce in transferring over $9 billion of transactions annually and
integrates financial and transaction processing into a single process. As an
information processing company, Cass focuses on these critical business areas:
Data Acquisition, Data Warehousing and Data Delivery. The Company receives data
from multiple sources, electronic and otherwise, and processes the data to
accomplish specific operating requirements of its customers. It then makes the
data available in a central repository for access and archiving. Finally, the
data is turned into information through the Company's databases that communicate
with clients as required and provide internet-based methods and tools for
analytical processing. In addition, the Company, through its wholly owned bank
subsidiary Cass Commercial Bank ("the Bank"), provides banking services in the
commercial, industrial and residential areas it serves. Its primary focus is to
support the Company's payment operations, and it also provides banking services
to its target markets, which include privately owned businesses and churches and
church-related ministries. Services include commercial, real estate and personal
loans; checking, savings and time deposit accounts and other cash management
services.

An important component of the Company's services is the financial control and
stability for handling the billions of dollars of payments and the
infrastructure for electronic funds transfers (EFT). The Company's wholly owned
subsidiary, Cass Commercial Bank was organized as a Missouri trust company with
banking powers in 1906. Its principal banking office is located at 13001
Hollenberg Drive, Bridgeton, Missouri, 63044 and it has four other branches in
the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area. Due to its ownership of a federally
insured commercial bank, the Registrant is a bank holding corporation and was
originally organized in 1982 as Cass Commercial Corporation under the laws of
Missouri and approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(the "FRB") in February 1983. The Company changed its name to Cass Information
Systems, Inc. in January 2001. The Company owns 100% of the outstanding shares
of common stock of Cass Commercial Bank. The principal offices of the Company
are at 13001 Hollenberg Drive, Bridgeton, Missouri. Other operating locations
are in Columbus, Ohio and Boston, Massachusetts.

Marketing, Customers and Competition

The Company believes it is the largest firm in the freight bill payment industry
in the United States based on the total dollars of freight bills paid.
Competition consists of three primary competitors and numerous small freight
bill audit firms located throughout the United States. While offering freight
payment services, few of these audit firms compete on a national basis. The
Company also competes with other companies, located throughout the United
States, that pay utility bills and provide management reporting. Available data
indicates that the Company is one of the largest providers of utility
information processing and payment services. Due to the fact that this is a new
market, the competitive environment for utility bill processing and payment is
difficult to assess and is changing rapidly. Cass is unique among these
competitors in that it is not exclusively affiliated with any one energy service
provider (ESP). In January 2001, the Company purchased the assets of "The
Utility Navigator(R)" a division of privately held Insite Services, Inc. for
$750,000. This acquisition added new ESP's for the Company's product as well as
provided additional processing growth.

The Company's bank subsidiary encounters competition from other banks located
throughout the St. Louis metropolitan area and other areas in which the Bank
competes. Savings banks, credit unions, other financial institutions and
non-bank providers of financial services also provide competition. The principal
competition however, is represented by bank holding company affiliates, many of
which are larger and have greater resources than the Bank, and are able to offer
a wide range of banking and related services through extensive branch networks.


                                       1
<PAGE>

The Company holds several trademarks for the payment and rating services it
provides. These include: FreightPay(R), Transdata(R), TransInq(R), Ratemaker(R),
Rate Advice(R), First Rate(R), Best Rate(R) and Rate Exchange(R).

The Company is not dependent on any one customer for a significant portion of
its business. It has a varied client base with no individual client exceeding
10% of total revenue. The Bank is also not dependent on any one customer. The
Bank does however, target its services to privately-held businesses located in
the St. Louis, MO area and church and church related institutions located in St.
Louis, MO and other selected cities located throughout the United States.

Employees

The Company had 608 full-time and 74 part-time employees as of December 31,
2001. Of these employees, the bank subsidiary had 68 full-time and 6 part-time
employees.

Supervision and Regulation

The Company and its bank subsidiary are extensively regulated under federal and
state law. These laws and regulations are intended to protect depositors, not
shareholders. The Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Missouri
Division of Finance, the FRB and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
"FDIC"). The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and as such, it is subject to
regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB. The Company is required to
file quarterly and annual reports with the FRB and to provide to the FRB such
additional information as the FRB may require, and it is subject to regular
inspections by the FRB. Bank regulatory agencies use Capital Adequacy Guidelines
in their examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks. If the
capital falls below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, the
agencies may force certain remedial action to be taken. The Capital Adequacy
Guidelines are of several types and include risk-based capital guidelines, which
are designed to make capital requirements more sensitive to various risk
profiles and account for off-balance sheet exposure; guidelines which consider
market risk, which is the risk of loss due to change in value of assets and
liabilities due to changes in interest rates; and guidelines that use a leverage
ratio which places a constraint on the maximum degree of risk to which a bank
holding company may leverage its equity capital base. For further discussion of
the capital adequacy guidelines and ratios, please see, Item 7 "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and
Item 8 , Note 2 of this report.

The FRB also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies,
including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to
issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company
divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement
actions may be initiated for violations of law or regulations or for unsafe or
unsound practices. Both the FRB and Missouri Division of Finance also have
restrictions on the amount of dividends that banks and bank holding companies
may remit.

As a bank holding company, the Company must obtain prior approval from the FRB
before acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of
another bank or bank holding company or acquiring all or substantially all of
the assets of such a company. In many cases, prior approval is also required for
the Company to engage in similar acquisitions involving a non-bank company or to
engage in new non-bank activities. Any change in applicable laws or regulations
may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company.

Financial Information about Segments

The revenues from external customers, net income (loss) and total assets by
segment, for the three years ended December 31, 2001 are set forth in Part II,
Item 8, Note 12 of this report.

Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies

"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations".

Missouri. This location is owned by the Company, and includes a building with
approximately 61,500 square feet of office space, 20,500 of which is occupied by
the Bank. In March 2001 the Company moved in to its newly owned production
facility of approximately 45,500 square feet located at 2675 Corporate Exchange
Drive, Columbus, Ohio. The Company


                                       2

operates an additional production facility in Lowell, Massachusetts where
approximately 25,800 square feet of office space is leased through October 31,
2005.

The Company's bank subsidiary's headquarters are located at 13001 Hollenberg
Drive, Bridgeton, Missouri, 63044. The Bank leases approximately 20,500 square
feet of the 61,500 square foot building owned by the Company. In addition, the
Bank owns a banking facility near downtown St. Louis that consists of
approximately 1,600 square feet with adjoining drive-up facilities. The Bank has
additional leased facilities in Maryland Heights, Missouri (2,500 square feet);
Fenton, Missouri (1,250 square feet) and Chesterfield, Missouri (2,850 square
feet).

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company and its subsidiaries are not involved in any pending proceedings
other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to their businesses.
Management believes none of these proceedings, if determined adversely, would
have a material effect on the business or financial condition of the Company or
its subsidiaries.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

The following presents Management's discussion and analysis of the Company's
consolidated financial condition and results of operations as of the dates and
for the periods indicated. This discussion should be read in conjunction with
Item 1 "Business", Item 6 "Selected Consolidated Financial Data", the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in Item 8 and
other financial data appearing in this report.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this
report in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (U.S. GAAP). In preparing the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements,


                                       4
<PAGE>

and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
There can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those
estimates.

Management has identified the accounting policy related to the allowance for
loan losses as critical to the understanding of the Company's results of
operations, since the application of this policy requires significant management
assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different amounts to
be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change. The impact
and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations
are discussed in the " Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses" section of this
report.

In addition, management evaluates certain long-term assets such as premises and
equipment, goodwill, and foreclosed assets for impairment. Generally,
recognition of impairment is required when events and circumstances indicate
that the carrying amounts of these assets will not be recoverable in the future.
If impairment occurs, various methods of measuring impairment may be called for
depending on the circumstances and type of asset, including quoted market
prices, estimates based on similar assets, and estimates based on valuation
techniques such as discounted projected cash flows. Assets held for sale are
carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. The application
of this policy also requires significant management assumptions and estimates
that could result in materially different results if conditions or underlying
circumstances change.

Net Income Summary

The 2001 results compared to 2000 include the following significant pre-tax
components:

      Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased $1,120,000
      or 3.6% due primarily to a $43,999,000 increase in average earning assets,
      including a $48,313,000 increase in average loans outstanding and a
      decrease in the provision for loan losses of $690,000. The increase in net
      interest income from these factors offset the negative effect of the
      decrease in the general level of interest rates.

      Total noninterest income increased $2,129,000 or 10.1% due to several
      factors. Total freight and utility payment and processing fees increased
      $2,052,000 or 11.3%, with an increase of $2,234,000 or 100.2% in utility
      payment and processing fees and offset by a $182,000 or 1.1% decrease in
      revenue from freight payment and processing services. The increase in
      utility payment and processing fees relates to the rapid expansion of the
      customer base. At the end of 2001 the Company processed nearly 2.5 million
      utility invoices representing over $1.7 billion of invoice value. The
      decrease in revenue from freight payment and processing services was due
      to several factors. The most significant of these was that due to the
      slowing economy, freight shipments of its customer base decreased
      significantly from 2000. In addition, a greater percentage of payment and
      processing revenue was obtained from increased investable balances
      generated rather than from fees. Bank service fees increased $137,000 or
      9.9% due to an expansion of the Bank's customer base and the fact that
      service fees increase as the value of noninterest bearing deposits, used
      to compensate the Bank for services provided, decrease as the general
      level of interest rates decrease.

      Total noninterest expense increased $3,493,000 or 8.5% due to several
      factors. The most significant of these include salaries and benefits which
      increased $1,969,000 or 6.9% primarily due to an increased staff at the
      Company's new utility processing facility in Columbus, Ohio. Second,
      equipment expense increased $804,000 or 26.6% primarily due to an
      increased investment in information technology. Finally, outside service
      fees increased due to an increase in outsourced programming services to
      assist in the expansion of the utility payment and processing division as
      well as increased outsourcing of data entry services.

The 2000 results compared to 1999 include the following significant pre-tax
components:

      Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased $4,621,000
      or 17.4% due to a $22,935,000 increase in average earning assets, a
      $69,220,000 increase in average loans outstanding and a rise in the
      general level of interest rates, which more than offset a $750,000
      increase in the provision for loan losses.

      Total noninterest income decreased $330,000 or 1.5% due to several
      factors. Total freight and utility payment and processing fees decreased
      $136,000 or .7% despite a $749,000 increase in revenue from utility
      payment and processing services. The decrease in revenue from freight
      payment and processing services was due to several factors. First, there
      was a decrease in non-recurring other miscellaneous freight fees. Second,
      there were continued anticipated decreases of some freight payment
      services that were part of a prior acquisition. Finally, a greater
      percentage of payment and processing revenue was obtained from investable
      balances generated rather than from fees. Bank service fees increased
      $238,000 or 20.7% due to a significant increase in the Bank's customer
      base.

      Total noninterest expense increased $2,892,000 or 7.5% due to several
      factors. The most significant was the Company's investment in the utility
      processing area and in new freight processing capabilities. Due to the


                                       5
<PAGE>

      rapid growth in the utility processing area, the Company was unable to
      leverage freight processing resources to the extent that was initially
      envisioned. As a result, a much larger investment in staff and processing
      support had to be made to accommodate the fast rate of growth. In
      addition, the Company invested heavily in Internet system capabilities and
      internal system development in the freight processing area that will allow
      greater growth in this area in the future.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans,
investments, and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other
interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the most significant source
of the Company's revenues.

Net interest income in 2001 compared to 2000:

On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2001 totaled $32,660,000, an
increase of $549,000 or 1.7% over 2000. The net interest margin for 2001 was
6.26% compared to 6.70% in 2000. The following factors account for this increase
in net interest income and decrease in net interest margin:

      Total average earning assets increased $43,999,000 or 9.2% to
      $522,121,000. This increase was funded by an increase in average accounts
      and drafts payable and an increase in deposit liabilities generated by the
      Bank. The Company's accounts and drafts payable increased due to an
      increase in dollars processed and a lengthening of the time funds were
      available for investment. The time funds are available for investment is
      negotiated by customer and is part of the compensation for providing the
      Company's services. The Bank saw an increase in both interest bearing
      deposits, as a result of increased marketing efforts, and noninterest
      bearing deposits, mainly from bank customers that maintained higher
      balances to compensate the Bank for services and to avoid increased
      services fees in a lower rate environment. The interest generated from the
      increase in average earning assets was offset by a decrease in the general
      level of interest rates.

      Total average loans increased $48,313,000 or 14.7% to $376,275,000. This
      increase was attributable to new business relationships and funded by the
      increase in payables and deposit liabilities. This increase in loans
      increased interest income and had a positive effect on the net interest
      margin due to the fact that loans are the Company's highest yielding
      earning asset.

      Total average federal funds sold and other short-term investments
      increased $7,004,000 or 10.6% to $72,888,000. Since these are the lowest
      yielding earning assets, increases in average balances outstanding can
      increase interest income but may lower the yield on earning assets and
      decrease the net interest margin.

      The net interest margin decreased primarily because of the dramatic
      decrease in the general level of interest rates. Prime decreased from
      9.50% at the end of 2000 to 4.75% at the end of 2001. Also, the Federal
      funds rate ended the year at 1.75%, the lowest level in nearly 40 years.
      The average yield on earning assets decreased to 7.00% in 2001 from 7.78%
      in 2000. The Company is negatively affected by decreases in the level of
      interest rates due to the fact that its rate sensitive assets
      significantly exceed its rate sensitive liabilities. Conversely, the
      Company is positively affected by increases in the level of interest
      rates. This is primarily due to the noninterest-bearing liabilities
      generated by the Company in the form of accounts and drafts payable. More
      information is contained in Item 7A of this report.

Net interest income in 2000 compared to 1999:

On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2000 totaled $32,111,000, an
increase of $5,390,000 or 20.2% over 1999. The net interest margin for 2000 was
6.70% compared to 5.87% in 1999. The following factors account for this increase
in net interest income and net interest margin:

      Total average earning assets increased $22,935,000 or 5.0% to
      $478,122,000. This increase was due mainly to an increase in accounts and
      drafts payable resulting from an increase in dollars processed. This
      increase, combined with a rise in the general level of interest rates,
      contributed to the increase in net interest income.

      Total average loans increased $69,220,000 or 26.8% to $327,962,000. This
      increase was attributable to new business relationships and funded by the
      increase in payables along with a decrease in federal funds sold and other
      short-term investments. This increase in loans increased interest income
      and had a positive effect on the net interest margin due to the fact that
      loans are the Company's highest yielding earning asset.

      Total average federal funds sold and other short-term investments
      decreased $51,658,000 or 43.9% to $65,884,000. Since these are the lowest
      yielding earning assets, decreases in average balances outstanding


                                       6
<PAGE>

      can decrease interest income, but the reinvestment of these funds in
      higher yielding assets will increase the average yield on earning assets
      and therefore interest income and net interest margin.

      The net interest margin increased primarily because of the increase in the
      general level of interest rates and a shift of earning assets from lower
      yielding federal funds sold and other short-term investments to higher
      yielding loans and securities. The average yield on earning assets
      increased to 7.78% in 2000 from 6.83% in 1999. The Company is positively
      affected by increases in the level of interest rates due to the fact that
      its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive
      liabilities. Conversely, the Company is adversely affected by decreases in
      the level of interest rates. This is primarily due to the
      noninterest-bearing liabilities generated by the Company in the form of
      accounts and drafts payable. More information is contained in Item 7A of
      this report.

3.    Interest income on loans includes net loan fees of $301,000, $327,000 and
      $91,000 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
4.    Interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a tax rate
      of 34%. The tax-equivalent adjustment was approximately $350,000, $231,000
      and $212,000 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
5.    For purposes of these computations, yields on investment securities are
      computed as interest income divided by the average amortized cost of the
      investments.

</TABLE>

(1)   Loans have been classified as having "floating" interest rates if the rate
      specified in the loan varies with the prime commercial rate of interest.

The Company has no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans which
are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table and
discussed in Item 8, Note 4 of this report. As can be seen in the loan
composition table above and discussed in Item 8, Note 4, the Company's primary
market niche for banking services is privately held commercial companies and
churches and church-related ministries. Loans to the commercial entities are
generally secured by the business assets of the company, including accounts
receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and the building(s)/plant(s)
from which the company operates. Operating lines of credit to these companies
generally are secured by accounts receivable and inventory, with specific
percentages of each determined on a customer by customer basis, based on various
factors including the business in which the customer operates. Intermediate term
credit for machinery and equipment is generally loaned at some percentage of the
value of the equipment purchased, again depending on the type of machinery or
equipment purchased by the entity (e.g., less funds would be loaned on
restaurant equipment which has a lower resale value than certain types of
machinery which tend to hold their value). Long term credits are secured by the
entities' building(s)/plant(s) and are generally loaned with a maximum 80% loan
to value ratio.

Loans secured exclusively by real estate to businesses and churches are
generally made with a maximum 80% loan to value ratio, again depending upon the
Company's estimate of the resale value and ability for the property to generate
cash flow. The Company's loan policy requires an independent appraisal for all
loans over $250,000 secured by real estate. Company management monitors the
local economy in an attempt to determine whether it has had a significant
deteriorating effect on such real estate credits. When problems are identified,
appraised values are updated on a continual basis, either internally or through
an updated external appraisal.

Loan portfolio changes from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001:

      Total loans increased $9,232,000 or 2.5% to $381,452,000. This increase
      was due mainly to the expansion of church and church-related loans in the
      St. Louis metropolitan area and selected areas across the United States.
      At year-end church and church-related real estate and construction credits
      totaled $103,527,000, which represented a 22% increase over 2000.
      Additional details regarding the types and maturities of the loan
      portfolio are contained in the tables above and in Item 8, Note 4.

Loan portfolio changes from December 31, 1999 to December 31, 2000:

      Total loans increased $93,877,000 or 33.7% to $372,220,000. This increase
      was due mainly to the addition of new lending relationships in the Bank's
      privately held business banking services group and the expansion of church
      and church-related loans in the St. Louis metropolitan area and selected
      areas across the United States. At year-end church and church-related real
      estate and construction credits totaled $84,955,000, which represented a
      29% increase over 1999. Additional details regarding the types and
      maturities of the loan portfolio are contained in the tables above and in
      Item 8, Note 4.

Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses

The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $60,000 in 2001 and $750,000
in 2000 and no provision in 1999. The provision in 2001 was due to the Company's
analysis of the allowance for loan losses in relation to potential losses in the
loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses in 2000 was based on the increase
in average loans outstanding and the increase in nonperforming loans. Loan
charge-offs, net of recoveries, experienced by the Company were $51,000 in 2001,
$135,000 in 2000 and $146,000 in 1999. The allowance for loan losses was
$4,906,000 at December 31, 2001, compared to $4,897,000 at December 31, 2000 and
$4,282,000 at December 31, 1999. The year-end 2001 allowance represented 1.29%
of outstanding loans, compared to 1.32% at year-end 2000 and 1.54% at year-end
1999. From December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001 the level of nonperforming
loans decreased $659,000 from $1,131,000 to $472,000, which represents .12% of
outstanding loans.

The allowance for loan losses has been established and is maintained to absorb
losses inherent in the loan portfolio. An ongoing assessment of risk of loss is
performed to determine if the current balance of the allowance is adequate to
cover potential losses in the portfolio. A charge or credit is made to expense
to cover any deficiency or reduce any excess. The current methodology employed
to determine the appropriate allowance consists of two components, specific and
general. The specific component includes a review of each loan on the Company's
classified or watch list in terms of collateral and possible loss exposure based
on existing circumstances known to management and under current economic
conditions. The general component relates to all other loans which are evaluated
based on the loan grade assigned to the credit with a percentage of each grade
allocated to the allowance for loan losses. The percentages are based on
historical standards. The loan grades assigned to each credit are evaluated on
an annual basis, unless circumstances require interim evaluation. Finally, a
portion is added to the general reserve to take into account other factors
including national and local economic conditions, downturns in specific
industries including loss in collateral value, trends in credit quality at the
Company and the banking industry, and trends in risk rating changes.

Nonperforming Assets

It is the policy of the Company to continually monitor its loan portfolio and to
discontinue the accrual of interest on any loan on which payment of principal or
interest in a timely manner, in the normal course of business, is doubtful.
Subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to principal if there is
any doubt as to the collectibility of such principal; otherwise, these receipts
are recorded as interest income. Interest on nonaccrual loans, which would have
been recorded under the original terms of the loans, was approximately $65,000
for the year ended December 31, 2001. Of this amount, approximately $3,000 was
actually recorded as interest income on such loans.

At December 31, 2001, after review of potential problem loans identified by
management, including those noted in the table below, management of the Company
concluded the allowance for loan losses was adequate. As of December 31, 2001,
approximately $53,000 of loans not included in the table below were identified
by management as having potential credit problems that raised doubts as to the
ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms, which
resulted in a total of $525,000 in impaired loans.

On January 2, 2001, the Bank foreclosed on certain operating assets relating to
one borrower in order to protect the Bank's financial interest in that borrower.
The Bank is currently in the process of stabilizing this business and will
continue to operate the business as an unconsolidated subsidiary until it can be
merged into another entity or sold. This subsidiary is a software company that
provides the public sector with intergrated financial, property and human
resource management systems. At December 31, 2001 the Bank's investment in this
company was $5,110,000. Based on unaudited financial statements, this company
generated $4,187,000 in revenues and incurred $5,211,000 in operating expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2001.

On August 8, 2001, the Bank foreclosed on a loan to one borrower and is now
carrying the property as other real estate owned at what management believes to
be the fair value less cost to sell of the property of $600,000. The remaining
balance of the loan was $110,000 and this was charged against the allowance for
loan losses at the time of foreclosure.

The Company does not have any foreign loans. The Company's loan portfolio does
not include a significant amount of single family real estate mortgage or
installment credits, as the Company does not market its services to retail
customers.

The Company does not have any other interest-earning assets which would have
been included in nonaccrual, past due or restructured loans if such assets were
loans.

      above and Item 8, Note 1 of this report.

Noninterest Income

The Company's noninterest income is derived mainly from fee revenue relating to
the payment and processing of freight and utility invoices. As the Company
provides its freight and utility processing and payment services, it is
compensated by service fees which are typically calculated on a per-item basis
and by the accounts and drafts payable generated in the payment process which
can be used to generate interest income. Processing volumes related to fees and
accounts and drafts payable for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999
are as follows:

In addition to payment processing revenue, the Company also received fees from
the sale, maintenance, and service operations relating to freight rating
software. After December 31, 2001 the Company ceased the sale and maintenance of
its rating software and replaced this product with its web-based Ratemaker
product, which generates revenue from subscription and related service fees.
Other noninterest revenue is generated by the Bank in the form of fees that
relate to the credit, depository, and cash management products of the Bank. Bank
customers compensate the Bank for these services through fees, the maintenance
of demand deposit balances, or both.

Noninterest income in 2001 compared to 2000 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

      Freight and utility payment and processing revenue increased $2,052,000 or
      11.3% to $20,142,000. Of the total payment and processing revenue, fees
      related to utility payment and processing increased $2,234,000 and fees
      relating to freight payment and processing services decreased $182,000.
      The increase in utility payment and processing fees relates to the rapid
      expansion of the customer base. During 2001 the Company processed nearly
      2.5 million utility invoices representing over $1.7 billion of invoice
      value. The decrease in revenue from freight payment and processing
      services was primarily due to the slowing economy, which resulted in
      freight shipments of the existing customer base decreasing significantly
      from 2000 levels. In addition, a greater percentage of payment and
      processing revenue was obtained from increased investable balances
      generated rather than from fees.


                                       12
<PAGE>

      Freight rating services revenue increased $14,000 or 1.0% to $1,348,000. A
      change in the strategic direction of the Company from selling rating
      software to a new Internet-based delivery system of carrier rates occurred
      during 2000 and 2001. This system will offer the shipping community an
      expanded level of features, capabilities and ease of access. The Company
      saw a decrease in revenue from its rating software maintenance fees, which
      it discontinued on December 31, 2001, but this decrease was more than
      offset by the fees generated from the new Ratemaker product.

      Service charges generated by the Bank increased $137,000 or 9.9% to
      $1,522,000. This increase was due primarily to the growth of the Bank's
      customer base and the fact that service fees increase as the value of
      noninterest bearing deposits, used to compensate the Bank, decrease as the
      general level of interest rates decrease.

      Other miscellaneous noninterest income decreased $74,000 or 24.3% to
      $231,000. This decrease was due primarily to discontinuing the sale of the
      Company's rating software in 2001.

Noninterest income in 2000 compared to 1999 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

      Freight and utility payment and processing revenue decreased $136,000 or
      .7% to $18,090,000. Of the total payment and processing revenue, fees
      related to utility payment and processing increased $749,000 and fees
      relating to freight payment and processing services decreased $885,000.
      The increase in utility payment and processing fees relates the rapid
      expansion of the customer base. At the end of 2000 the Company was
      processing 1.7 million utility invoices representing over $1 billion of
      invoice value on an annualized basis. The decrease in revenue from freight
      payment and processing services was due to several factors. First, there
      was a decrease in non-recurring other miscellaneous freight fees. Second,
      there were continued anticipated decreases relating to some freight
      payment services that were part of a prior acquisition. Finally, the
      balance of compensation relating to the delivery of these services to the
      existing customer base shifted from service fees to increases in accounts
      and drafts payable.

      Freight rating services revenue decreased $466,000 or 25.9% to $1,334,000
      due to a change in the strategic direction of the Company from selling
      rating software to the development of a new Internet-based delivery system
      of carrier rates. This system will offer the shipping community an
      expanded level of features, capabilities and ease of access.

      Service charges generated by the Bank increased $238,000 or 20.7% to
      $1,385,000. This increase was due primarily to the growth of the Bank's
      customer base.

      Other miscellaneous noninterest income increased $34,000 or 12.5% to
      $305,000. This increase was due primarily to additional miscellaneous
      services provided by the Company to its customers.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in 2001 compared to 2000 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

      Salaries and employee benefits increased $1,969,000 or 6.9% to
      $30,469,000. These increases were primarily related to an increased staff
      at the Company's new utility processing facility in Columbus, Ohio. The
      Company also experienced increases in pension and health insurance expense
      along with annual salary increases.

      Occupancy expense decreased $100,000 or 5.7% to $1,658,000 primarily due
      to a decrease in rent expense the Company experienced after moving its
      Columbus operations from leased space to a newly acquired building.
      Equipment expense increased $804,000 or 26.6% to $3,831,000 and other
      noninterest expenses increased $820,000 or 10.3% to $8,771,000. These
      increases relate mainly to expansion of utility payment processing
      capabilities, increased investment in freight payment processing and
      Internet capabilities and other normal operating expense fluctuations.
      More details on the components of other noninterest operating expenses are
      contained in Item 8, Note 8 of this report.

Noninterest expense in 2000 compared to 1999 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

      Salaries and employee benefits increased $2,526,000 or 9.7% to
      $28,500,000. This increase was caused by several factors. First,
      additional staff was hired in utility payment processing in order to keep
      pace with the


                                       13
<PAGE>

      growth in this area. Second, health insurance premiums increased and the
      Company changed health insurance carriers to provide additional benefits
      to employees. Third, an increase in profits resulted in an increase in
      bonus expenses. Finally, annual salary increases accounted for the
      remainder.

      Occupancy expense decreased $22,000 or 1.2% to $1,758,000. Equipment
      expense increased $313,000 or 11.5% to $3,027,000. Other noninterest
      expenses increased $75,000 or 1.0% to $7,951,000. The increases in
      equipment expense and other noninterest expense relate mainly to expansion
      of utility payment processing capabilities, increased investment in
      freight payment processing and Internet capabilities and other normal
      operating expense fluctuations. More details on the components of other
      noninterest operating expenses are contained in Item 8, Note 8 of this
      report.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense in 2001 totaled $3,739,000 compared to $3,861,000 in 2000 and
$3,411,000 in 1999. When measured as a percent of income before income taxes,
the Company's effective tax rate was 34.7% in 2001, 35.1% in 2000 and 35.5% in
1999.

Investment Portfolio

Investment portfolio changes from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001:

      U.S. Government Treasury securities decreased $17,963,000 or 59.4% to
      $12,284,000. This decrease was caused by a decision to invest in higher
      yielding securities and fund expected future loan growth.

      U.S. Government corporations and agencies increased $40,050,000 or 107.5%
      to $77,313,000. This increase was due to a decision to invest in
      longer-term, higher yielding investments, given the declining interest
      rate environment.

      State and political subdivisions increased $918,000 or 77.7% to
      $2,099,000. This was also due to the decision to invest in longer term,
      higher yielding investments.

Investment portfolio changes from December 31, 1999 to December 31, 2000:

      U.S. Government Treasury securities decreased $12,026,000 or 28.4% to
      $30,247,000. This decrease was caused by the decision to increase the
      Company's liquidity given expected loan growth.

      U.S. Government corporations and agencies decreased $2,006,000 or 5.1% to
      $37,263,000. This decrease was also due to the decision to fund expected
      loan growth.

There was no single issuer of securities in the investment portfolio at December
31, 2001 other than the U.S. Government and U.S. Government agencies and
corporations, for which the aggregate amortized cost exceeded ten percent of
total shareholders' equity.

Deposits and Accounts and Drafts Payable

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $17,410,000 or 17.4% from
$99,941,000 at December 31, 2000 to $117,351,000 at December 31, 2001. The
average balance of these accounts increased $13,093,000 or 16.4% from
$79,749,000 in 2000 to $92,842,000 in 2001. These increases relate to new
business and to the fact that the earnings credit rate on noninterest-bearing
demand deposits decreased with the decline in interest rates in general. In
order to compensate the Bank for services rendered, customers increased balances
in those accounts, paid more in fees, or both.

Interest-bearing deposits increased from $112,725,000 at December 31, 2000 to
$130,627,000 at December 31, 2001. The average balances of these deposits
increased $15,177,000 or 14.2% from $106,935,000 in 2000 to $122,112,000 in
2001. These increases relate mainly to the Bank's increased marketing efforts to
attract more deposits.

Accounts and drafts payable generated by the Company in its payment processing
operations decreased $11,046,000 or 3.6% from $302,840,000 at December 31, 2000
to $291,794,000 at December 31, 2001. The average balances of these funds
increased $26,645,000 or 9.9% from $267,963,000 in 2000 to $294,608,000 in 2001.
Due to the Company's payment processing cycle, average balances are much more
indicative of the underlying activity than period-end balances since
point-in-time comparisons can be misleading if the comparison dates fall on
different days of the week. The increase in average balances can be attributed
to the fact that the dollar amount of invoices processed and the time funds were
available for investment increased.

The composition of average deposits and the average rates paid on those deposits
is represented in the table entitled "Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and
Stockholders' Equity; Interest Rate and Interest Differential" which is included
earlier in this discussion. The Company does not have any significant deposits
from foreign depositors.

Liquidity

The discipline of liquidity management as practiced by the Company seeks to
ensure that funds are available to fulfill all payment obligations relating to
the freight and utility invoices processed as they become due, meet depositor
withdrawal requests and borrower credit demands while at the same time
maximizing profitability. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand
for funds with changes in the supply of funds. Primary liquidity to meet demand
is provided by short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash, maturing
securities and the ability to attract funds from external sources. The Company's
Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) has direct oversight responsibility for the
Company's liquidity position and profile. Management considers both on-balance
sheet and off-balance sheet transactions in its evaluation of liquidity.

The balances of liquid assets consists of cash and cash equivalents, which
include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and money market funds, and
were $99,855,000 at December 31, 2001, a decrease of $16,076,000 or 13.9% from
December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2001 these assets represented 16.6% of total
assets. These funds


                                       15
<PAGE>

are the Company's and its subsidiaries' primary source of liquidity to meet
future expected and unexpected loan demand, depositor withdrawals or reductions
in accounts and drafts payable.

Secondary sources of liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing
lines. Total investment in debt and equity securities was $92,330,000 at
December 31, 2001, an increase of $23,005,000 or 33.2% from December 31, 2000.
These assets represented 15.4% of total assets at December 31, 2001. Of this
total, 13% were U.S. treasury securities, 27% were U.S. government agencies, 57%
were mortgage-backed securities and 3% were other securities. Of the total
portfolio, 20% matures in one year, 20% matures in one to five years, and 60%
matures in five or more years. At January 2, 2001 the Company transferred the
remaining balance of held-to-maturity securities into available-for-sale
securities as allowed upon the adoption of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities". The investment portfolio provides secondary
liquidity through regularly scheduled maturities, the ability to sell securities
out of the available-for-sale portfolio, and the ability to use these securities
in conjunction with its reverse repurchase lines of credit.

The Bank has unsecured lines at correspondent banks to purchase federal funds up
to a maximum of $20,341,000. Additionally, the Bank maintains a line of credit
at an unaffiliated financial institution in the maximum amount of $60,000,000
collateralized by securities sold under repurchase agreements.

The deposits of the Company's banking subsidiary have historically been stable,
consisting of a sizable volume of core deposits related to customers that
utilize many other commercial products of the bank. The accounts and drafts
payable generated by the Company has also historically been a stable source of
funds.

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $8,697,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2001, compared to $12,311,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Net cash used in investing activities was $43,441,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2001, compared with $86,709,000 for the year ended December 31,
2000. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31,
2001 was $18,668,000, compared with $66,112,000 for the year ended December 31,
2000. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities relates primarily to
the greater increase in loans during the year ended December 31, 2000 and a
greater amount of debt and equity securities maturing during the year ended
December 31, 2001, which was partially offset by the purchase of more debt and
equity securities during the year. The decrease in net cash provided by
financing activities relates primarily to a greater increase in accounts and
drafts payable during 2000, which was offset by an increase in deposits.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Activities

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to activities that
contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or
in part in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Such activities
include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments and
commitments under operating leases. For details on operating leases see Item 8,
Note 5 of this report.

The Company provides customers with off-balance sheet credit support through
unused loan commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and
commercial letters of credit. Summarized credit-related financial instruments,
including both commitments to extend credit and letters of credit at December
31, 2001 are as follows:

Since many of the unused commitments are expected to expire or be only partially
used, the total amount of commitments in the preceding table does not
necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Capital Resources

One of Management's primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital base to
warrant the confidence of customers, shareholders, and bank regulatory agencies.
A strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable growth
opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and creditors.
The Company and its banking subsidiary continue to significantly exceed all
regulatory capital requirements, as evidenced by the capital ratios at December
31, 2001 as shown in Item 8, Note 2 of this report.

In 2001, cash dividends paid were $.80 per share for a total of $2,579,000, a
7.4% decrease over the prior year, which is attributable to the decrease in the
number of shares outstanding. On December 21, 1999 the Board of Directors
authorized a stock repurchase program that allowed the repurchase of up to
200,000 shares of common stock through December 31, 2000. On March 21, 2000 the
Board of Directors authorized a 100,000 increase in the number of shares that
could be purchased under the program. Along with the 300,000 shares authorized
under the plan, the Board of Directors approved the repurchase of an additional
262,210 shares, including 161,700 purchased during 2001. Repurchases were made
in the open market or through negotiated transactions from time to time
depending on market conditions.

Shareholders' equity was $55,520,000 or 9.2% of total assets at December 31,
2001, an increase of $1,699,000 over the balance at December 31, 2000. This
increase resulted from net income of $7,025,000, an increase in other
comprehensive income of $363,000 and other items of $169,000, which was
partially offset by cash dividends paid of $2,579,000 and repurchases of stock
of $3,279,000.

Management believes that current cash, cash equivalents, maturing investments
and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund the Company's operations and
capital expenditures in 2002.

Dividends from the bank subsidiary are a significant source of funds for payment
of dividends by the Company to its shareholders. The only restrictions on
dividends are those dictated by regulatory capital requirements and prudent and
sound banking principles. As of December 31, 2001, unappropriated retained
earnings of $2,472,000 were available at the Bank for the declaration of
dividends to the Company without prior approval from regulatory authorities.

Effect Of Recent And Prospective Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS 141), "Business Combinations",
and SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". SFAS 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations
completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also specifies criteria which intangible
assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be
recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS 142 will require that goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but
instead tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS 142 will also require that
intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for
impairment in accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets".

The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 141 immediately and SFAS
142 effective January 1, 2002. Furthermore, any goodwill and any intangible
asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a
purchase business combination completed after June 30, 2001 will not be
amortized, but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with
the appropriate pre-SFAS 142 accounting literature. Goodwill and intangible
assets acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 will
continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of SFAS 142.

SFAS 141 will require upon adoption of SFAS 142, that the Company evaluate its
existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase
business combination, and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to
conform with the new criteria in SFAS 141 for recognition apart from goodwill.
Upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company will be required to reassess the useful
lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business
combinations, and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end
of the first interim period after adoption. In addition, to the extent an
intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life, the Company
will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS 142 within the first interim period. Any impairment loss
will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period.

As of the date of adoption, the Company had unamortized goodwill in the amount
of $223,000 which will be subject to the transition provisions of SFAS 141 and
142. Amortization expense related to goodwill was $30,000 for each of the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. The Company is evaluating its goodwill for
impairment in accordance with SFAS 142 and does not believe adoption of that
standard will have a material effect on its operations.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, which addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets. While SFAS 144 supercedes
Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of," it retains many of the fundamental
provisions of that statement. SFAS 144 also supercedes the accounting and
reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations

Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment
of a business. However, it retains the requirement in Opinion No. 30 to report
separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of
an entity has been disposed of (by sale, abandonment, or in a distribution to
owners) or is classified as held for sale. By broadening the presentation of
discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions, the FASB has
enhanced management's ability to provide information that helps financial
statement users to assess the effects of a disposal transaction on the ongoing
operations of an entity. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001 and interim financial periods within those fiscal years.
Management believes that adopting SFAS 144 will not have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements.

In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities", which establishes standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. It requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those
instruments at fair value. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS 137, "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective
Date of FASB No. 133", which defers the effective date of SFAS 133 from fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 1999 to fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities", which addresses certain issues
causing implementation difficulties. The Company has adopted SFAS 133, as
amended, effective January 1, 2001, but since the Company does not participate
in any derivative or hedging activities, SFAS 133, as amended, had no impact on
the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations, except
for the transfer of all held-to-maturity securities into available-for-sale
securities as of January 1, 2001 as permitted by SFAS 133. At the time of the
transfer the book value of the securities transferred was $6,650,000 and the
fair value was $6,682,000. The difference was an unrealized gain recorded net of
tax as other comprehensive income.

Effects of Inflation

The Company's assets and liabilities are primarily monetary, consisting of cash,
cash equivalents, securities, loans, payables and deposits. Monetary assets and
liabilities are those that can be converted into a fixed number of dollars. The
Company's consolidated balance sheet reflects a net positive monetary position
(monetary assets exceed monetary liabilities). During periods of inflation, the
holding of a net positive monetary position will result in an overall decline in
the purchasing power of a company. Management believes that replacement costs of
equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements will not materially affect
operations. The rate of inflation does affect certain expenses, such as those
for employee compensation, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of
the Company's services.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Sensitivity

The Company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and its
fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest rates.
The asset/liability management discipline as applied at the Company seeks to
limit the volatility, to the extent possible, of both net interest income and
the fair market value of equity that can result from changes in market interest
rates. This is accomplished by limiting the maturities of fixed rate
investments, loans, and deposits; matching fixed rate assets and liabilities to
the extent possible; and optimizing the mix of fees and net interest income.
However, as discussed below, the Company's asset/liability position differs
significantly from most other bank holding companies with significant positive
cumulative "gaps" shown for each time horizon presented. This asset sensitive
position is caused primarily by the operations of the Company, which generates
large balances of accounts and drafts payable. These balances, which are
noninterest bearing, contribute to the Company's high net interest margin but
cause the Company to become susceptible to changes in interest rates, with a
decreasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of
declining interest rates and an increasing net interest margin and fair market
value of equity in periods of rising interest rates.

The Company's Asset/Liability Management Committee (ALCO) measures the Company's
interest rate risk sensitivity on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage the
variability of earnings and fair market value of equity in various interest rate
environments. The ALCO evaluates the Company's risk position to determine
whether the level of exposure is significant enough to hedge a potential decline
in earnings and value or whether the Company can safely increase risk to enhance
returns. The ALCO uses gap reports, twelve-month net interest income
simulations, and fair market value of equity analyses as its main analytical
tools to provide management with insight into the Company's exposure to changing
interest rates.

A gap report is used by management to review any significant mismatch between
the repricing points of the Company's rate sensitive assets and liabilities in
certain time horizons. A negative gap indicates that more liabilities


                                       18
<PAGE>

reprice in that particular time frame and, if rates rise, these liabilities will
reprice faster than the assets. A positive gap would indicate the opposite. Gap
reports can be misleading in that they capture only the repricing timing within
the balance sheet, and fail to capture other significant risks such as basis
risk and embedded options risk. Basis risk involves the potential for the spread
relationship between rates to change under different rate environments and
embedded options risk relates to the potential for the alteration of the level
and/or timing of cash flows given changes in rates.

Another measurement tool used by management is net interest income simulation,
which forecasts net interest income during the coming twelve months under
different interest rate scenarios in order to quantify potential changes in
short term accounting income. Management has set policy limits specifying
acceptable levels of interest rate risk given multiple simulated rate movements.
These simulations are more informative than gap reports because they are able to
capture more of the dynamics within the balance sheet, such as basis risk and
embedded options risk. Simulation results illustrate that the Company's net
interest income over the next twelve months would decrease 4.7% from an
immediate and sustained parallel decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points
and increase 4.0% from a corresponding increase in interest rates.

While net interest income simulations do a good job of capturing interest rate
risk to short term earnings, they do not capture risk within the current balance
sheet beyond twelve months. The Company uses fair market value of equity
analyses to help identify longer-term risk that may reside on the current
balance sheet. The fair market value of equity is represented by the present
value of all future income streams generated by the current balance sheet. The
Company measures the fair market value of equity as the net present value of all
asset and liability cash flows discounted at forward rates suggested by the
current Treasury curve plus appropriate credit spreads. This representation of
the change in the fair market value of equity under different rate scenarios
gives insight into the magnitude of risk to future earnings due to rate changes.
Management has set policy limits relating to declines in the market value of
equity. The results of these analyses indicate that the Company's fair market
value of equity would decrease 5.5% from an immediate and sustained parallel
decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points and increase 4.3% from a
corresponding increase in interest rates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The Company provides payment and information services, which include processing
and payment of freight and utility invoices, preparation of transportation
management reports, auditing of freight charges and rating of freight shipments.
The Company is subject to competition from other commercial concerns providing
similar services to companies throughout the United States and Canada. The
consolidated balance sheet caption "Accounts and Drafts Payable," consists of
obligations related to the payment services that are performed for customers.

The Company also provides a full range of banking services to individual,
corporate and institutional customers through its wholly owned subsidiary bank.
The Bank is subject to competition from other financial and nonfinancial
institutions throughout the metropolitan St. Louis, Missouri area and other
areas in which the Bank competes. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are
subject to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies and undergo
periodic examinations by those regulatory agencies.

On January 9, 2001 the Company's subsidiary, Cass Information Systems, Inc. was
merged into the parent company, Cass Commercial Corporation, and the parent's
name was subsequently changed to Cass Information Systems, Inc.

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries
conform to accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of
America. The following is a description of the more significant of those
policies.

Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of
intercompany transactions.

Use of Estimates In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Company
management is required to make estimates and assumptions which significantly
affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. A
significant estimate which is particularly susceptible to change in a short
period of time is the determination of the allowance for loan losses.

Investment in Debt and Equity Securities At the time of purchase, debt
securities are classified into one of two categories: available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which the
Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. All equity
securities, and debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity, are
classified as available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Held-to-maturity
securities are recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for the amortization of
premiums or discounts. Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax
effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported
as accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on the sale of
available-for-sale securities are determined using the specific identification
method.

A decline in the fair value of any available-for-sale or held-to-maturity
security below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings
and results in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security.

The Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the
Federal Reserve Bank. The stock is recorded at cost, which represents redemption
value. The Bank has elected to become a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank and
has invested in its common stock which is recorded at cost, which represents
redemption value.

Interest on Loans Interest on loans is recognized based upon the principal
amounts outstanding. It is the Company's policy to discontinue the accrual of
interest when there is reasonable doubt as to the collectibility of principal or
interest. Subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to principal if
there is any doubt as to the collectibility of such principal; otherwise, these
receipts are recorded as interest income. The accrual of interest on a loan is
resumed when the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest
and/or the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current.

Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is increased by
provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge-offs. The provisions
charged to expense are based on economic conditions, past losses, collection
experience, risk characteristics of the portfolio and such other factors which,
in management's judgment, deserve current recognition.


                                       24
<PAGE>

Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses
in the loan portfolio. While management uses all available information to
recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary
based on changes in economic conditions. Additionally, various regulatory
agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review
the Company's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company
to increase the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and
interpretations about information available to them at the time of their
examination.

Information Services Revenue Revenue from freight and utility related services
is recognized when fees are billed to customers, generally monthly.

Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, or the respective lease terms for
leasehold improvements, using straight-line and accelerated methods. Estimated
useful lives are 31 1/2 to 39 years for buildings, 8 to 10 years for leasehold
improvements and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures, equipment and software.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

Investment in Unconsolidated Subsidiary On January 2, 2001, the Company
foreclosed on certain operating assets to one borrower in order to protect the
financial interest in that borrower. The Bank is currently stabilizing this
business until it can be merged into another entity or sold, and is operating it
as Government e-Management Solutions, Inc. It is accounted for as a foreclosed
asset at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell.

Other Real Estate Owned Other real estate, included in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is recorded at fair value less
estimated selling costs. If the fair value of other real estate declines
subsequent to foreclosure, the difference is recorded as a valuation allowance
through a charge to expense. Subsequent increases in fair value are recorded
through reversal of the valuation allowance. Expenses incurred in maintaining
the properties are charged to expense.

Intangible Assets Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and fair
value in excess of cost of net assets acquired have resulted from business
acquisitions which were accounted for using the purchase method. The premiums
and discounts related to the fair value adjustments are amortized using the
level-yield method.

Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and fair value in excess of
cost of net assets acquired are amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 to 15
years.

Periodically, the Company reviews its intangible assets for events or changes in
circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable. Based on those reviews, adjustments of recorded amounts have not
been required.

The Company adopted the provision of SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets", effective January 1, 2002 which requires that goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be
tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS 142 will also require that
intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for
impairment in accordance with SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". At December 31, 2001 the Company had $223,000 of
goodwill, which is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.

Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

Cash Flows For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the
Company considers due from banks, federal funds sold and other short-term
investments to be cash equivalents.

Reclassifications Certain amounts in the 2000 and 1999 consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform with the 2001 presentation. Such
reclassifications have no effect on previously reported net income.

Note 2
Capital Requirements And Regulatory Restrictions

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements
administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional
discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under
capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital
guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain
off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The
Company and the Bank's capital amounts and classifications are also subject to
qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and
other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy
require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total
and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier I capital to average
assets. Management believes as of December 31, 2001, the Company and the Bank
met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action. The most recent notification from the regulatory agencies, dated
December 14, 2001, categorized the Bank as well capitalized. To be categorized
as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I
risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There
are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes
have changed the Bank's category.

Subsidiary dividends are a principal source of funds for payment of dividends by
the Company to its shareholders. The Bank is subject to regulations which
require the maintenance of minimum capital levels. At December 31, 2001,
unappropriated retained earnings of $2,472,000 were available at the Bank for
the declaration of dividends to the Company without prior approval from
regulatory authorities.

Restricted funds on deposit used to meet regulatory reserve requirements
amounted to approximately $761,000 and $2,053,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

The Company and the Bank's actual and required capital amounts and ratios as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows:

The Company originates commercial, industrial, real estate and installment loans
to businesses, churches and consumers throughout the metropolitan St. Louis
area. The Company also originates church and church-related loans outside the
metropolitan St. Louis area. The Company does not have any particular
concentration of credit in any one economic sector; however, a substantial
portion of the commercial and industrial loans are extended to privately held
commercial companies in this market area, and are generally secured by the
assets of the business. The Company also has a substantial portion of real
estate loans that are extended to churches, in this market area and selected
cities throughout the United States, which are secured by mortgages.

Loan transactions involving executive officers and directors of the Company and
its subsidiaries and loans to affiliates of executive officers and directors for
the year ended December 31, 2001, are summarized below. Such loans were made in
the normal course of business on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for
comparable transactions with other persons, and did not involve more than the
normal risk of collectibility.

Employee Benefits

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which covers
substantially all of its employees. The Company's subsidiaries accrue and make
contributions designed to fund normal service costs on a current basis using the
projected unit credit with service proration method to amortize prior service
costs arising from improvements in pension benefits and qualifying service prior
to the establishment of the plan over a period of approximately 30 years.

The pension cost for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $700,000, $386,000 and $784,000,
respectively, and included the following components:

accruals designed to fund normal service costs on a current basis using the same
method and criteria as its defined benefit plan.

2000 and 7.75% and 4.00% in 1999.

The provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 87,
"Employers' Accounting for Pensions", require the Company to record an
additional minimum liability of $638,000 and $533,000 at December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. This liability represents the amount by which the
accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair value of plan assets
and accrued amounts previously recorded. The additional liability is offset by
an intangible asset to the extent of previously unrecognized prior service cost.
The intangible assets of $587,000 and $533,000 at December 31, 2001 and 200,
respectively, are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. The remaining amount at December 31, 2001 of $51,000 is
recorded, net of tax, as an accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The Company maintains a noncontributory profit sharing plan which covers
substantially all of its employees. Employer contributions are calculated based
upon formulas which relate to current operating results and other factors.
Profit sharing expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income in
2001, 2000 and 1999 was $1,588,000, $1,617,000 and $1,413,000, respectively.

The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan to provide additional
retirement benefits to substantially all employees. Contributions under the
401(k) plan for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $260,000, $247,000 and $234,000,
respectively.

The Company maintains a restricted stock bonus plan which provides for the
issuance of up to 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The fair value
of such shares, which is based on the market price on the date of grant, has
been recorded in the consolidated financial statements through the establishment
of a contra shareholders' equity account which is amortized over the three-year
vesting period. Amortization of the restricted stock bonus awards totaled
$80,000, $81,000 and $68,000 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Changes in stock bonus shares outstanding were as follows:

The Company also maintains a performance-based stock option plan which provides
for the granting of options to acquire up to 400,000 shares of Company common
stock. Options vest over a period not to exceed seven years, but the vesting
period can be less based on the Company's attainment of certain financial
operating performance criteria.

At December 31, 2001, 50,608 shares were exercisable with a weighted average
exercise price of $11.59.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the stock option plan in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25), and accordingly, recognizes no compensation
expense as the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company elected
not to adopt the recognition provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS 123). An entity that continues to apply APB 25
shall disclose certain pro forma information as if the fair value-based
accounting method in SFAS 123 had been used to account for stock-based
compensation costs. The required disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 are provided
in the table below. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
determine the fair value of the stock options at the date of grant. The weighted
average assumptions used in 1999 were: an expected life of 7 years, dividend
yield of 2.64%, expected volatility of 7.63% and risk-free interest rate of
6.31%. There were no additional grants in 2000 and 2001. The following table
represents the effect on earnings and diluted earnings per share:

A valuation allowance would be provided on deferred tax assets when it is more
likely than not that some portion of the assets will not be realized. The
Company has not established a valuation allowance at December 31, 2001 or 2000,
due to management's belief that all criteria for recognition have been met,
including the existence of a history of taxes paid sufficient to support the
realization of deferred tax assets.

Note 10
Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various pending legal actions
and proceedings in which claims for damages are asserted. Management, after
discussion with legal counsel, believes the ultimate resolution of these legal
actions and proceedings will not have a material effect upon the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Note 11
Disclosures About Financial Instruments

The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the
normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These
financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters
of credit and standby letters of credit. The Company's exposure to credit loss
in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument
for commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit and standby
letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those
instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commercial
and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These
off-balance-sheet financial instruments generally have fixed expiration dates or
other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the
financial instruments may expire without being drawn upon, the total amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commitments to extend credit
and letters of credit are subject to the same underwriting standards as those
financial instruments included on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company
evaluates each customer's credit-worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount
of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of the credit, is
based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies,
but is generally accounts receivable, inventory, residential or income-producing
commercial property or equipment.

Conditional commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit and
standby letters of credit totaled approximately $28,644,000, $111,000 and
$6,026,000, respectively, at December 31, 2001.

Following is a summary of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's
financial instruments at December 31, 2001 and 2000:

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash and Other Short-term Instruments For cash and cash equivalents, accrued
interest receivable, accounts and drafts payable, short-term borrowings and
accrued interest payable, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair
value because of the demand nature or short maturities of these instruments.

Investment in Debt and Equity Securities Fair values are based on quoted market
prices or dealer quotes.


                                       35

Loans The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows
using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with
similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings deposits and certain money
market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair
value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates
currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value
estimates above do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost
funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing
funds in the market nor the benefit derived from the customer relationship
inherent in existing deposits.

Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit The fair value of
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are estimated using
the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account
the remaining terms of the agreements, the likelihood of the counterparties
drawing on such financial instruments and the present credit-worthiness of such
counterparties. The Company believes such commitments have been made at terms
which are competitive in the markets in which it operates; however, no premium
or discount is offered thereon and, accordingly, the Company has not assigned a
value to such instruments for purposes of this disclosure.

Limitations Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance-sheet
financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated
future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered
financial instruments. Other significant assets or liabilities that are not
considered financial assets or liabilities include premises and equipment and
the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit
liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market (core deposit
intangible). In addition, tax ramifications related to the realization of the
unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value
estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.

Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial
instruments, fair value estimates are based on management's judgments regarding
future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk
characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

Note 12
Industry Segment Information

The services provided by the Company are classified into three reportable
segments: Transportation Information Services, Utility Information Services, and
Banking Services. Each of these segments offers distinct services that are
marketed through different channels. They are managed separately due to their
unique service, processing and capital requirements.

The Transportation Information Services unit provides freight invoice rating,
payment, auditing, cost accounting and transportation information services to
large corporate shippers. The Utility Information Services unit processes and
pays utility invoices, including electricity, gas, water, telephone and refuse,
for large corporate entities that have many locations or are heavy users of
energy. The Banking Services unit provides banking services primarily to
privately held businesses and churches.

The Company's accounting policies for segments are the same as those described
in Note 1 on pages 24 and 25 of this report. Management evaluates segment
performance based on net income after allocations for corporate expenses and
income taxes. Transactions between segments are accounted for at what management
believes to be market value. The Company initiated the reporting of information
relating to the Utility Information Services unit in 2001 due to its growth and
formalization of its existence as an operating unit. Previous period information
has been restated, when practical, to reflect this addition.

All three segments market their services within the United States and no revenue
from any customer of any segment exceeds 10% of the Company's consolidated
revenue.

Summarized information about the Company's operations in each industry segment
for the periods ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, is as follows:

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cass Information Systems, Inc.:

      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cass
Information Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
shareholders' equity and comprehensive income for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2001. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cass
Information Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
