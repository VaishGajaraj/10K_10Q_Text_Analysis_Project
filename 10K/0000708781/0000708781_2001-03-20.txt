ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
           --------

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Cass Information Systems, Inc. ("Cass" or "the Company") is a leading
provider of information processing services to large manufacturing, chemical,
food, personal products, and retail enterprises across the United States.
The Company is the nation's largest provider of freight invoice rating,
payment, audit, cost accounting and transportation information to many of the
nation's largest companies.  It is also the largest processor and payer of
utility invoices, including electricity, gas, water, telephone and refuse
collection.  Cass extracts, stores and presents information from freight and
utility invoices, assisting our customers' traffic and energy managers in
making decisions that will enable them to improve their operating
performance.  Cass utilizes web, Internet and browser technology in all of
its systems.  It heavily utilizes electronic commerce in moving over $8
billion of transactions annually.  It is able to bring financial and
transaction processing components together in a single process.  As an
information processing company, Cass focuses on these critical business
areas: Data Acquisition, Data Warehousing and Data Delivery.  The Company
receives data from multiple sources, electronic and otherwise, and processes
the data to accomplish specific operating requirements of its customers.  It
then makes the data available in a central repository for access and
archiving.  Finally, the data is turned into information through the
Company's databases that communicate with clients as required and provide
internet-based methods and tools for analytical processing.  Cass offers some
of its services as an Application Service Provider (ASP).  In addition, the
Company, through its wholly owned bank subsidiary Cass Commercial Bank ("the
Bank"), provides banking services in the commercial, industrial and
residential areas it serves.  Its primary focus is to support the Company's
payment operations, and it also provides banking services to its target
markets, which include privately owned businesses and churches and
church-related ministries.  Services include commercial, real estate and
personal loans; checking, savings and time deposit accounts and other cash
management services.

An important component of the Company's services is the financial control and
stability for handling the billions of dollars of payments and the
infrastructure for electronic funds transfers (EFT).  The Company's wholly
owned subsidiary, Cass Commercial Bank was organized as a Missouri trust
company with banking powers in 1906.  Its principal banking office is located
at 13001 Hollenberg Drive, Bridgeton, Missouri, 63044 and it has five other
branches in the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area.  Due to its ownership
of a federally insured commercial bank, the Registrant is a bank holding
corporation originally organized in 1982 as Cass Commercial Corporation,
under the laws of Missouri and approved by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (the "FRB") in February 1983.  On January 9, 2001 the
Company's subsidiary, Cass Information Systems, Inc. was merged into the
parent company, Cass Commercial Corporation, and the parent's name was
subsequently changed to Cass Information Systems, Inc.  As of December 31,
2000, the Company owned 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of
Cass Commercial Bank. The main operating location of the Company is at 13001
Hollenberg Drive, Bridgeton, Missouri.  Other operating locations are in
Columbus, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois and Boston, Massachusetts.

MARKETING, CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITION

The Company believes it is the largest firm in the freight bill payment
industry based on the total dollars of freight bills paid. Competition
consists of five primary competitors and numerous small freight bill audit
firms located throughout the United States.  While offering freight payment
services, few of these audit firms compete on a national basis.  The Company
also competes with several companies, located throughout the United States,
that pay utility bills and provide extensive management reporting.  Available
data indicates that the Company is also the largest provider of utility
information processing and payment services.  Due to the fact that this is a
new market, the competitive environment for utility bill processing and
payment is difficult to assess and is changing rapidly.  The Company appears
to have five or six firms that provide comparable services.  Most of these
are regulated subsidiaries of Public Utility companies.  There is
consolidation occurring among these companies and Cass now provides
processing services as an ASP for many Energy Service Providers (ESP).  In
December 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase the assets
of "The Utility Navigator(R)" a division of privately held Insite Services,
Inc. (see subsequent events, in Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations").  This will add
new ESP's for the Company's product as well as provide additional processing
growth.

The Company's bank subsidiary encounters substantial competition from other
banks located throughout the St. Louis metropolitan area.  Savings banks,
credit unions, other financial institutions and non-bank providers of
financial services also provide competition.  The principal competition
however, is represented by bank holding

                                      2

<PAGE> 3

company affiliates, many of which are larger and have greater resources than
the Bank, and are able to offer a wide range of banking and related services
through extensive branch networks.

The Company owns several service marks for the freight payment services and
logistics information software it provides.  Those marks deemed the most
valuable are "Freightpay", the basic freight payment service and
"Ratemaker", a rate maintenance service.  In addition, the Company either
owns or has applied for other service marks.

The Company is not dependent on any one customer for a large portion of its
business.  It has a varied client base with no individual client exceeding
10% of total revenue.  The Bank is also not dependent on any one customer.
The Bank does however, target its services to privately-held businesses
located in the St. Louis, MO area and church and church related institutions
located in St. Louis, MO and other selected cities located throughout the
United States.

EMPLOYEES

The Company had 618 full-time and 84 part-time employees as of December 31,
2000.  Of these employees, the bank subsidiary had 71 full-time and 7
part-time employees.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

The Company and its bank subsidiary are extensively regulated under federal
and state law.  These laws and regulations are intended to protect
depositors, not shareholders.  The Bank is subject to regulation and
supervision by the Missouri Division of Finance, the FRB and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The Company is a bank holding
company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended, and as such, it is subject to regulation, supervision and
examination by the FRB.  The Company is required to file quarterly and annual
reports with the FRB and to provide to the FRB such additional information as
the FRB may require, and it is subject to regular inspections by the FRB.
Bank regulatory agencies use Capital Adequacy Guidelines in their examination
and regulation of bank holding companies and banks.  If the capital falls
below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, the agencies may
force certain remedial action to be taken.  The Capital Adequacy Guidelines
are of several types and include risk-based capital guidelines, which are
designed to make capital requirements more sensitive to various risk profiles
and account for off-balance sheet exposure; guidelines which consider market
risk, which is the risk of loss due to change in value of assets and
liabilities due to changes in interest rates; and guidelines that use a
leverage ratio which places a constraint on the maximum degree of risk to
which a bank holding company may leverage its equity capital base.  For
further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines and ratio, please see
Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations."

The FRB also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies,
including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties,
to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding
company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries).  In general,
enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law or regulations or
for unsafe or unsound practices. Both the FRB and Missouri Division of
Finance also have restrictions on the amount of dividends that banks and bank
holding companies may remit.

As a bank holding company, the Company must obtain prior approval from the
FRB before acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting
shares of another bank or bank holding company or acquiring all or
substantially all of the assets of such a company.  In many cases, prior
approval is also required for the Company to engage in similar acquisitions
involving a non-bank company or to engage in new non-bank activities.  Any
change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on the
business and prospects of the Company.

Company expects to occupy in the early part of 2001.  Currently the Company
operates a production facility in Columbus where approximately 26,000 square

ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
            -----------------

other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to their businesses.
Management believes none of these proceedings, if determined adversely, would
have a material effect on the business or financial condition of the Company
or its subsidiaries.

==================================================================================================
</TABLE>

The 2000 results compared to 1999 include the following significant pre-tax
components:

       Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased
       $4,621,000 or 17.4% due to a $22,935,000 increase in average earning
       assets, a $69,220,000 increase in average loans outstanding and a rise
       in the general level of interest rates, which more than offset a
       $750,000 increase in the provision for loan losses.

       Total noninterest income decreased $330,000 or 1.5% due to several
       factors.  Total freight and utility payment and processing fees
       decreased $136,000 or .7% despite a $749,000 increase in revenue from
       utility payment and processing services.  The decrease in revenue from
       freight payment and processing services was due to several factors.
       First, there was a decrease in non-recurring other miscellaneous
       freight fees.  Second, there were continued anticipated decreases of
       some freight payment services that were part of a prior acquisition.
       Finally, a greater percentage of payment and processing revenue was
       obtained from investible balances generated rather than from fees.
       Bank service fees increased $238,000 or 20.7% due to a significant
       increase in the Bank's customer base.

       Total noninterest expense increased $2,892,000 or 7.5% due to several
       factors.  The most significant was the Company's investment in the
       utility processing area and in new freight processing capabilities.
       Due to the rapid growth in the utility processing area, the Company
       was unable to leverage freight processing resources to the extent that
       was initially envisioned.  As a result, a much larger investment in
       staff and processing support had to be made to accommodate the fast
       rate of growth.  It is estimated that the pre-tax loss on utility
       payment processing services was approximately $500,000.  In addition,
       the Company invested heavily in Internet system capabilities and
       internal system development in the freight processing area that will
       allow greater growth in this area in the future.  Finally, annual
       salary increases and higher benefit expenses accounted for a
       significant part of the increase.

The 1999 results compared to 1998 include the following significant pre-tax
components:

       Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased $746,000
       or 2.9% due to a $45,667,000 increase in average loans and a
       $22,032,000 increase in average earning assets, which were partially
       offset by a decline in the general level of interest rates.

       Total noninterest income decreased $1,003,000 or 4.5% due to several
       factors.  Total freight and utility payment and processing revenue
       decreased $583,000 or 3.1% despite a $726,000 increase in revenue from
       utility payment and processing services.  The decrease in revenue from
       freight payment and processing services was due to several factors.
       First, there was a decrease in the volume of freight transactions due
       largely to the growth in competition for electronic data interchange
       (EDI) processing of parcel and air shipments.  Second, there were
       continued anticipated decreases of some freight payment services that
       were

       part of a prior acquisition.  Finally, the implementation of new
       prospects, which typically exceed lost business, appeared to be
       delayed by our prospect's Y2K remediation programs.  Freight rating
       services revenue decreased $346,000 or 16.1% due to a change in
       Company direction from selling rating software to Internet-based
       systems.  Bank service fees increased $283,000 or 32.8% due to an
       increase in the Bank's customer base.  Finally, the Company recognized
       a $285,000 gain on the sale of securities in 1998.

       Total noninterest expense increased $1,719,000 or 4.7% due to several
       factors.  The most significant was the Company's investment in the
       utility processing area and in new freight processing capabilities.
       Due to the rapid growth in the utility processing area, the Company
       was unable to leverage freight processing resources to the extent that
       was initially envisioned.  As a result, a much larger investment in
       staff and processing support had to be made to accommodate the fast
       rate of growth.  It is estimated that the pre-tax loss on utility
       payment processing services exceeded $1,000,000.  In addition, the
       Company invested heavily in Internet system capabilities and internal
       system development in the freight processing area that will allow
       greater growth in this area in the future.  Finally, annual salary
       increases and higher benefit expenses accounted for a significant part
       of the increase.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans,
investments, and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other
interest-bearing liabilities.  Net interest income is a significant source of
the Company's revenues.

Net interest income in 2000 compared to 1999:

On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2000 totaled $32,111,000,
an increase of $5,390,000 or 20.2% over 1999.  The net interest margin for
2000 was 6.70% compared to 5.87% in 1999.  The following factors account for
this increase in net interest income and net interest margin:

       Total average earning assets increased $22,935,000 or 5.0% to
       $478,122,000.  This increase was due mainly to an increase in accounts
       and drafts payable resulting from an increase in dollars processed.
       This increase, combined with a rise in the general level of interest
       rates, contributed to the increase in net interest income.

       Total average loans increased $69,220,000 or 26.8% to $327,962,000.
       This increase was attributable to new business relationships and
       funded by the increase in payables along with a decrease in federal
       funds sold and other short-term investments.  This increase in loans
       increased interest income and had a positive effect on the net
       interest margin due to the fact that loans are the Company's highest
       yielding earning asset.

       Total average federal funds sold and other short-term investments
       decreased $51,658,000 or 43.9% to $65,884,000.  Since these are the
       lowest yielding earning assets, decreases in average balances
       outstanding can decrease interest income, but the reinvestment of
       these funds in higher yielding assets will increase the average yield
       on earning assets and therefore interest income and net interest
       margin.

       The net interest margin increased primarily because of the increase in
       the general level of interest rates and a shift of earning assets from
       lower yielding federal funds sold and other short-term investments to
       higher yielding loans and securities.  The average yield on earning
       assets increased to 7.78% in 2000 from 6.83% in 1999.    The Company
       is positively affected by increases in the level of interest rates due
       to the fact that its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its
       rate sensitive liabilities.  Conversely, the Company is adversely
       affected by decreases in the level of interest rates.  This is
       primarily due to the noninterest-bearing liabilities generated by the
       Company in the form of accounts and drafts payable.  More information
       is contained in the tables that follow.

Net interest income in 1999 compared to 1998:

On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 1999 totaled $26,721,000,
an increase of $833,000 or 3.2% over 1998.  The net interest margin for 1999
was 5.87% compared to 5.98% in 1998.  The following factors account for this
increase in net interest income and decrease in net interest margin:

       Total average earning assets increased $22,032,000 or 5.1% to
       $455,187,000.  This increase was due to an increase in non-interest
       bearing demand and interest bearing deposits at the Bank resulting
       from new business development efforts and an increase in accounts and
       drafts payable at the Company from an

                                   7

       increase in dollars processed.  This increase in earning assets
       contributed to the increase in net interest income.

       Total average loans increased $45,667,000 or 21.4% to $258,742,000.
       This increase was funded by the increase in deposits and payables
       along with the maturity of debt securities.  This increase in loans
       increased interest income and had a positive effect on the net
       interest margin due to the fact that loans are the Company's highest
       earning asset.

       Total average federal funds sold and other short-term investments
       increased $6,737,000 or 6.1% to $117,542,000.  This increase was also
       funded by the increase in deposits and payables and maturities of debt
       securities.  Since these are the lowest yielding earning assets,
       increases in average balances outstanding can increase interest
       income, but reduce the average yield on earning assets and therefore
       the net interest margin.

       Although net interest income increased, the net interest margin
       decreased primarily because of the decline in the general level of
       interest rates.  The average yield on earning assets decreased to
       6.83% in 1999 from 6.96% in 1998.    The Company is adversely affected
       by decreases in the level of interest rates due to the fact that its
       rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive
       liabilities.  Conversely, the Company is positively affected by
       increases in the level of interest rates.  This is primarily due to
       the noninterest-bearing liabilities generated by the Company in the
       form of accounts and drafts payable.  More information is contained in
       the tables that follow.

1. Balances shown are daily averages.
2. For purposes of these computations, nonaccrual loans are included in the
   average loan amounts outstanding.  Interest on nonaccrual loans is
   recorded when received as discussed further in Item 8, Note 1 of this
   report.
3. Interest income on loans includes net loan fees of $327,000, $91,000 and
   $27,000 for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
4. Interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a tax rate
   of 34% for 2000, 1999 and 1998.  The tax-equivalent adjustment was
   approximately $231,000, $212,000 and $125,000 for 2000, 1999 and 1998,
   respectively.
5. For purposes of these computations, yields on investment securities are
   computed as interest income divided by the average amortized cost of the
   investments.

ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME CHANGES

The following table presents the changes in interest income and expense
between years due to changes in volume and interest rates.  That portion of
the change in interest attributable to the combined rate/volume variance has
been allocated to rate and volume changes in proportion to the absolute
dollar amounts of the change in each.

ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES

The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $750,000 in 2000 and no
provision in 1999 or 1998.  The Company increased the provision for loan
losses based on the increase in average loans outstanding and the increase in
nonperforming assets.  Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, experienced by
the Company were $135,000 in 2000, $146,000 in 1999 and $56,000 in 1998.  The
allowance for loan losses was $4,897,000 at December 31, 2000, compared to
$4,282,000 at December 31, 1999 and $4,428,000 at December 31, 1998. The
year-end 2000 allowance represents 1.32% of outstanding loans, compared to
1.54% at year-end 1999.  This decrease relates mainly to the increase in
total loans experienced during 2000.  From December 31, 1999 to December 31,
2000 the level of nonperforming assets increased $724,000 from $407,000 to
$1,131,000, which represents .30% of outstanding loans.  The majority of this
increase related to real estate construction loans of two borrowers.

1. Factors which influence management's determination of the provision for
   loan losses charged to expense for each of the years presented above,
   among other things, include evaluation of each nonperforming and/or
   classified loan to determine the estimated loss exposure under existing
   circumstances known to management; evaluation of all potential problem
   loans identified in light of probable loss exposure based upon existing
   circumstances known to management, current economic conditions and an
   overall review of the remainder of the portfolio in light of past loan
   loss experience.

2. The Company allocated its allowance for loan losses to the various loan
   categories at December 31, 2000 based on the ratio of total nonperforming
   loans over the last 5 years.  Management views the allowance for loan
   losses as being available for all potential or presently unidentified loan
   losses that may occur in the future. The risk of future losses that is
   inherent in the loan portfolio is not precisely attributable to a
   particular loan or category of loans.  Allocations estimated for the
   categories do not specifically represent that loan charge-offs of this
   magnitude will be required. The allocation does not restrict future loan
   losses attributable to a particular


                                      10


<PAGE>
<PAGE> 11

   category of loans from being absorbed by the portion of the allowance
   attributable to other categories of loans. The risk factors considered
   when determining the overall level of the allowance are the same when
   estimating the allocation by major category, as specified in the above
   summary.

</TABLE>

NONPERFORMING ASSETS

It is the policy of the Company to continually monitor its loan portfolio and
to discontinue the accrual of interest on any loan on which payment of
principal or interest in a timely manner in the normal course of business is
doubtful.  Subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to
principal if there is any doubt as to the collectibility of such principal;
otherwise, these receipts are recorded as interest income.  Interest on
nonaccrual loans, which would have been recorded under the original terms of
the loans, was approximately $123,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Of this amount, approximately $19,000 was actually recorded as interest
income on such loans.

At December 31, 2000, after review of potential problem loans identified by
management including those noted above, management of the Company concluded
the allowance for loan losses was adequate.  As of December 31, 2000,
approximately $4,691,000 of loans not included in the table below were
identified by management as having potential credit problems which raised
doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan
repayment terms.  Of this balance of potential credit problems, $4,263,000
were deemed to be impaired.  On January 2, 2001, the Bank foreclosed on
certain operating assets relating to one borrower in order to protect the
Bank's financial interest in that borrower.  A loan to this borrower
represented $4,205,000 of the balance of potential credit problems, not
included in the table below, at December 31, 2000.  The Bank is currently in
the process of stabilizing this business and will continue to operate the
business until it can be sold or merged into another entity.  As of January
2, 2001 the Bank's investment in this company amounted to $4,505,000.  All
other borrowers identified in this process are currently meeting all of the
terms of the applicable loan agreements, however their financial condition
has caused management to believe that their loans may result in disclosure at
some future time as nonaccrual, past due or restructured.

The Company has no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans which
are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table.  As can
be seen in the loan composition table above and discussed in Item 8, Note 4
of this report, the Company's primary market niche for banking services is
the privately held commercial company and churches and church-related
ministries. Loans to the commercial entities are generally secured by the
business assets of the company, including accounts receivable, inventory,
machinery and equipment, and the building(s)/plant(s) from which the company
operates. Operating lines of credit to these companies generally are secured
by accounts receivable and inventory, with specific percentages of each
determined on a customer by customer basis, based on the business in which
the customer operates. Intermediate term credit for machinery and equipment
is generally loaned at some percentage of the value of the equipment
purchased, again depending on the type of machinery or equipment purchased by
the entity (e.g., less funds would be loaned on restaurant equipment which
has a lower resale value than certain types of machinery which tend to hold
their value). Long term credits are secured by the entities'
building(s)/plant(s) and are generally loaned with a maximum 80% loan to
value ratio.

Loans secured exclusively by real estate to businesses and churches are
generally made with a maximum 80% loan to value ratio, again depending upon
the Company's estimate of the resale value and ability for the property to
generate cash flow. The Company's loan policy requires an independent
appraisal for all loans over $250,000 secured by real estate. Company
management monitors the local economy in an attempt to determine whether it
has had a significant deteriorating effect on such real estate credits. When
problems are identified, appraised values are updated on a continual basis,
either internally or through ordering an updated external appraisal.

The Company does not have any foreign loans.  The Company's loan portfolio
does not include a significant amount of single family real estate mortgage
or installment credits, as the Company does not market to the consumer side
of the banking business.

The Company does not have any other interest-earning assets which would have
been included in nonaccrual, past due or restructured loans if such assets
were loans.

NONINTEREST INCOME

The Company's noninterest income is derived mainly from fee revenue relating
to the payment and processing of freight and utility invoices.  As the
Company provides its freight and utility processing and payment services, it
is compensated by service fees which are typically calculated on a per-item
basis and by the accounts and drafts payable generated in the payment process
which can be used to generate interest income.  In addition to payment
processing revenue, the Company also receives fees from the sale,
maintenance, and service bureau operations relating to freight rating
software.  Other noninterest revenue is generated by the Bank in the form of
fees that relate to the credit, depository, and cash management products of
the Bank.  Bank customers compensate the bank through these fees, the
maintenance of demand deposit balances, or both.

Noninterest income in 2000 compared to 1999 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

       Freight and utility payment and processing revenue decreased $136,000
       or .7% to $18,090,000.  Of the total payment and processing revenue,
       fees related to utility payment and processing increased $749,000 and
       fees relating to freight payment and processing services decreased
       $885,000.  The increase in utility payment and processing fees relates
       the rapid expansion of our customer base.  At the end of 2000 the
       Company was processing 1.8 million utility invoices representing over
       a billion dollars of invoice value on an annualized basis.  The
       decrease in revenue from freight payment and processing services was
       due to several factors.  First, there was a decrease in non-recurring
       other miscellaneous freight fees.  Second, there were continued
       anticipated decreases relating to some freight payment services that
       were part of a prior acquisition.  Finally, the balance of
       compensation relating to the delivery of these services to the
       existing customer base shifted from service fees to increases in
       accounts and drafts payable.

       Freight rating services revenue decreased $466,000 or 25.9% to
       $1,334,000 due to a change in the strategic direction of the Company
       from selling rating software to the development of a new
       Internet-based delivery system of carrier rates.  This system will
       offer the shipping community an expanded level of features,
       capabilities and ease of access.

       Service charges generated by the Bank increased $238,000 or 20.7% to
       $1,385,000.  This increase was due primarily to the growth of the
       Bank's customer base.

       Other miscellaneous noninterest income increased $34,000 or 12.5% to
       $305,000.  This increase was due primarily to miscellaneous services
       provided by the Company to its customers.

Noninterest income in 1999 compared to 1998 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

       Freight and utility payment and processing revenue decreased $583,000
       or 3.1% to $18,226,000.  Of the total payment and processing revenue,
       fees related to utility payment and processing increased $726,000 and
       fees relating to freight payment and processing services decreased
       $1,309,000.  The increase in utility payment and processing fees
       relates the rapid expansion of our customer base.  At the end of 1999
       the Company was processing 1.5 million utility invoices representing
       almost a billion dollars of invoice value

                                      12

       on an annualized basis.  The decrease in revenue from freight payment
       and processing services was due to several factors.  First, there was
       a decrease in the volume of freight transactions due largely to the
       growth in competition for electronic data interchange (EDI) processing
       of parcel and air shipments.  The entrance in the marketplace of niche
       companies formed to process the increasing volume of overnight package
       shipments was caused in part by the increase in e-commerce
       transactions.  Historically, this has not been a strategic market for
       the Company.  A number of customers, while retained by the Company,
       moved this type of transaction to these new competitors.  The Company
       has since reengineered its processes to handle these transactions more
       effectively and it is anticipated that these transactions will provide
       significant growth in the future.  Second, there were continued
       anticipated decreases relating to some freight payment services that
       were part of a prior acquisition.  Finally, the implementation of new
       prospects, which typically exceed lost business, appeared to be
       delayed by our prospect's Y2K remediation programs.

       Freight rating services revenue decreased $346,000 or 16.1% due to a
       change in the strategic direction of the company from selling rating
       software to the development of a new Internet-based delivery system of
       carrier rates to the shipping community.

       Service charges generated by the Bank increased $283,000 or 32.8% to
       $1,147,000.  This increase was due primarily to the growth of the
       Bank's customer base.

       Other variances in total noninterest revenue include the fact that
       their was a $285,000 gain on the sale of securities in 1998 and that
       other miscellaneous noninterest income decreased $72,000 or 21.0% to
       $271,000.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Noninterest expense in 2000 compared to 1999 include the following
significant pre-tax components:

       Salaries and employee benefits increased $2,526,000 or 9.7% to
       $28,500,000.  This increase was caused by several factors.  First,
       additional staff was hired in utility payment processing in order to
       keep pace with the growth in this area.  Second, health insurance
       premiums increased and the Company changed health insurance carriers
       to provide additional benefits to employees.  Third, an increase in
       profits resulted in an increase in bonus expenses.  Finally, annual
       salary increases accounted for the remainder.

       Occupancy expense decreased $22,000 or 1.2% to $1,758,000.  Equipment
       expense increased $313,000 or 11.5% to $3,027,000.  Other noninterest
       expenses increased $75,000 or 1.0% to $7,951,000.  The increases can
       be attributed mainly to expansion of our utility payment processing
       capabilities, increased investment in our freight payment processing
       and Internet capabilities and other normal operating expense
       fluctuations.  More details on the components of other noninterest
       operating expenses are contained in Item 8, Note 8 of this report.

Noninterest expense in 1999 compared to 1998 include the following
significant pre-tax components:

       Salaries and employee benefits increased $979,000 or 3.9% to
       $25,974,000.  This increase was caused by several factors.  First,
       additional staff was hired in utility payment processing in order to
       keep pace with the growth in this area.  Second, employee benefits
       expense increased 15.1% due to increased pension accruals and health
       insurance costs.  Finally, annual salary increases accounted for the
       remainder.

       Occupancy expense increased $82,000 or 4.8% to $1,780,000.  Equipment
       expense increased $65,000 or 2.5% to $2,714,000.  Other noninterest
       expenses increased $593,000 or 8.1% to $7,876,000.  These increases
       can be attributed mainly to expansion of our utility payment
       processing capabilities, increased investment in our freight payment
       processing and Internet capabilities and other normal operating
       expense fluctuations.  More details on the components of other
       noninterest operating expenses are contained in Item 8, Note 8 of this
       report.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE

Income taxes in 2000 totaled $3,861,000 compared to $3,411,000 in 1999 and
$4,177,000 in 1998.  When measured as a percent of income before income
taxes, the Company's effective tax rate was 35.1% in 2000, 35.5% in 1999 and
36.1% in 1998.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

LIQUIDITY

Cash and cash equivalents, which consist of cash and due from banks, federal
funds sold, and money market funds, were $115,931,000 or 20.1% of total
assets at December 31, 2000.  These funds represent the Company's and the
Bank's primary source of liquidity to meet future expected and unexpected
loan demand, depositor withdrawls or reductions in accounts and drafts
payable.

Secondary sources of liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing
lines.  Total investment in debt and equity securities represented
approximately $69,325,000 or 12.0% of total assets at December 31, 2000.  Of
this total, 44% were U.S. treasury securities, 54% were U.S. government
agencies, and 2% were other securities.  Of the total portfolio, 27% matures
in one year, 62% matures in one to five years, and 11% matures in five or
more years.  Of the total portfolio, 90% is designated available for sale and
10% is designated held to maturity.  On January 2, 2001 the Company
transferred all remaining held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale
with the adoption of FASB 133.  The investment portfolio provides secondary
liquidity through regularly scheduled maturities, the ability to sell
securities out of the available-for-sale portfolio, and the ability to use
these securities in conjunction with its reverse repurchase lines of credit.
As of December 31, 2000 the Company had $19,820,000 in unsecured federal fund
lines of credit and $60,000,000 in reverse repurchase agreement lines with
unaffiliated financial institutions.

The deposits of the Company's banking subsidiary have historically been
stable, consisting of a sizable volume of core deposits related to customers
that utilize many other commercial products of the bank.  The accounts and
drafts payable generated by the Company has also proven to be a stable source
of funds.

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY

The Company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and
its fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest
rates.  The asset/liability management discipline as applied at the Company
seeks to limit the volatility, to the extent possible, of both net interest
income and the fair market value of equity that can result from changes in
market interest rates.  This is accomplished by limiting the maturities of
fixed rate investments, loans, and deposits; matching fixed rate assets and
liabilities to the extent possible; and optimizing the mix of fees and net
interest income.  However, as discussed below, the Company's asset/liability
position differs significantly from most other bank holding companies with
positive "gaps" shown for each time horizon presented. This asset sensitive
position is caused primarily by the operations of the Company, which
generates large balances of accounts and drafts payable.  These balances,
which are noninterest bearing, contribute to the Company's high net interest
margin but causes the Company to become susceptible to changes in interest
rates, with a decreasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity
in periods of declining interest rates and an increasing net interest margin
and fair market value of equity in periods of rising interest rates.

The Company's Asset/Liability Management Committee (ALCO) measures the
Company's interest rate risk sensitivity on a quarterly basis to monitor and
manage the variability of earnings and fair market value of equity in various
interest rate environments. The ALCO evaluates the Company's risk position to
determine whether the level of exposure is significant enough to hedge a
potential decline in earnings and value or whether the Company can safely
increase risk to enhance returns. The ALCO uses gap reports, twelve-month net
interest income simulations, and fair market value of equity analyses as its
main analytical tools to provide management with insight into the Company's
exposure to changing interest rates.

A gap report is used by management to review any significant mismatch between
the reproaching points of the Company's rate sensitive assets and liabilities
in certain time horizons. A negative gap indicates that more liabilities
reprice in that particular time frame and, if rates rise, these liabilities
will reprice faster than the assets. A positive gap would indicate the
opposite. Management has set policy limits specifying acceptable levels of
interest rate risk as measured by the gap report.  Gap reports can be
misleading in that they capture only the repricing timing within the balance
sheet, and fail to capture other significant risks such as basis risk and
embedded options risk. Basis risk involves the potential for the spread
relationship between rates to change under different rate environments and
embedded options risk relates to the potential for the alteration of the
level and/or timing of cash flows given changes in rates.

Another measurement tool used by management is net interest income
simulation, which forecasts net interest income during the coming twelve
months under different interest rate scenarios in order to quantify potential
changes in short

                                      14

term accounting income. Management has set policy limits specifying
acceptable levels of interest rate risk given multiple simulated rate
movements.  These simulations are more informative than gap reports because
they are able to capture more of the dynamics within the balance sheet, such
as basis risk and embedded options risk.  Simulation results illustrate that
the Company's net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease
4.3% from an immediate and sustained parallel decrease in interest rates of
100 basis points and increase 4.2% from a corresponding increase in interest
rates.

While net interest income simulations do a good job of capturing interest
rate risk to short term earnings, they do not capture risk within the current
balance sheet beyond twelve months. The Company uses fair market value of
equity analyses to help identify longer-term risk that may reside on the
current balance sheet. The fair market value of equity is represented by the
present value of all future income streams generated by the current balance
sheet. The Company measures the fair market value of equity as the net
present value of all asset and liability cash flows discounted at forward
rates suggested by the current Treasury curve plus appropriate credit
spreads.  This representation of the change in the fair market value of
equity under different rate scenarios gives insight into the magnitude of
risk to future earnings due to rate changes. Management has set policy limits
relating to declines in the market value of equity.  The results of these
analyses indicate that the Company's fair market value of equity would
decrease 4.3% from an immediate and sustained parallel decrease in interest
rates of 100 basis points and increase 3.7% from a corresponding increase in
interest rates.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

Investment portfolio changes from December 31, 1999 to December 31, 2000:

       U.S. Government Treasury securities decreased $12,026,000 or 28.4% to
       $30,247,000.  This decrease was caused by the decision to increase the
       Company's liquidity given expected loan growth.

                                      15

<PAGE> 16

       U.S. Government corporations and agencies decreased $2,006,000 or 5.1%
       to $37,263,000.  This decrease was also due to the Company's decision
       to fund expected loan growth.

Investment portfolio changes from December 31, 1998 to December 31, 1999:

       U.S. Government Treasury securities decreased $16,703,000 or 28.3% to
       $42,273,000.  This decrease was caused by the decision to allow
       maturities to exceed reinvestment in this sector in order to improve
       the yield of the portfolio.

       U.S. Government corporations and agencies increased $15,750,000 or
       67.0% to $39,269,000.  This increase was funded by maturities of U.S.

corporations and agencies, for which the aggregate amortized cost exceeded
ten percent of total shareholders' equity.

LOAN PORTFOLIO

Loan portfolio changes from December 31, 1999 to December 31, 2000:

       Total loans increased $93,877,000 or 33.7% to $372,220,000.  This
       increase was due mainly to the addition of new lending relationships
       in the Bank's privately held business banking services group and the
       expansion of church and church-related loans in the St. Louis
       metropolitan area and selected areas across the United States.  At
       year-end church and church-related real estate and construction
       credits totaled $84,955,000, which represented a 29% increase over
       1999.  Additional details regarding the types and maturities of the
       loan portfolio are contained in the tables below.

Loan portfolio changes from December 31, 1998 to December 31, 1999:

       Total loans increased $53,455,000 or 23.7% to $278,343,000.  This
       increase was due mainly to the addition of new lending relationships
       in the Bank's privately held business banking services group and the
       expansion of church and church-related loans in the St. Louis
       metropolitan area and selected cities across the United States.  At
       year-end church and church-related credits totaled $65,956,000, which
       represented a 90% increase over 1998.  Additional details regarding

DEPOSITS AND ACCOUNTS AND DRAFTS PAYABLE

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $8,269,000 or 9.0% from
$91,672,000 at December 31, 1999 to $99,941,000 at December 31, 2000.  The
average balance of these accounts increased $2,579,000 or 3.3% from
$77,170,000 in 1999 to $79,749,000 in 2000.  New business volume increased
throughout 2000 and should continue to increase in 2001.

Interest-bearing deposits increased from $97,064,000 at December 31, 1999 to
$112,725,000 at December 31, 2000.  The average balances of these deposits,
however, decreased $6,556,000 or 5.8% from $113,491,000 in 1999 to
$106,935,000 in 2000.  The decrease in average balances related mainly to the
movement of funds from deposit accounts to non-deposit investment
alternatives.

Accounts and drafts payable generated by the Company in its payment
processing operations increased $52,946,000 or 21.2% from $249,894,000 at
December 31, 1999 to $302,840,000 at December 31, 2000.  The average balances
of these funds increased $29,956,000 or 12.6% from $238,007,000 in 1999 to
$267,963,000 in 2000.  Due to the Company's payment processing cycle, average
balances are much more indicative of the underlying activity than period-end
balances since point-in-time comparisons can be misleading if the comparison
dates fall on different days of the week.  The increase in average balances
can be attributed to the fact that the dollar amount of invoices processed
increased.

The composition of average deposits and the average rates paid on those
deposits is represented in the table entitled "Distribution of Assets,
Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity; Interest Rate and Interest
Differential" which is included earlier in this discussion.  The Company does
not have any significant deposits from foreign depositors.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

One of the Company's primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital base
to warrant the confidence of our customers, shareholders, and bank regulatory
agencies.  A strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable
growth opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and
creditors. The Company and its banking subsidiary continue to significantly
exceed all regulatory capital requirements, as evidenced by the following
capital ratios at December 31, 2000:

In 2000, cash dividends declared totaled $2,784,000 or $.80 per share, a $.04
or 5.3% increase over the prior year.  On December 21, 1999 the Board of
Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that allowed the repurchase
of up to 200,000 shares of common stock through December 31, 2000.  On March
21, 2000 the Board of Directors authorized a 100,000 increase in the number
of shares that could be purchased under the program.  Along with the 300,000
shares authorized under the plan, the Board of Directors approved the
repurchase of an additional 100,180 shares.  During 2000 the Company
repurchased 394,510 shares.  Repurchases were made in the open market or
through negotiated transactions from time to time depending on market
conditions.

Shareholders' equity was $53,821,000 or 9.3% of total assets at December 31,
2000, a decrease of $2,742,000 over the balance at December 31, 1999.  This
decrease resulted from cash dividends paid of $2,784,000, repurchases of
stock of $7,828,000, which was partially offset by net income of $7,147,000,
a net unrealized gain on available for sale securities of $576,000 and other
items of $147,000.

Dividends from the bank subsidiary are a significant source of funds for
payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.  The only
restrictions on dividends are those dictated by regulatory capital
requirements and prudent and sound banking principles.  As of December 31,
2000, unappropriated retained earnings of $424,000 were available at the Bank
for the declaration of dividends to the Company without prior approval from
regulatory authorities.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On January 18, 2001 the Company announced that it acquired the business and
substantially all the assets of "The Utility Navigator(R)" a division of
privately held Insite Services, Inc.  These assets include all books and
records relating to the business, customer and vendor lists, customer
contracts, reporting history and databases, marketing and advertising
materials, trademarks and other intellectual property, and a license to the
software used to process and pay utility bills.  This move should solidify
the market position of the Company in this emerging market.

EFFECT OF RECENT AND PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133) which establishes
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.  It
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those
instruments at fair value.  In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB No. 133,
which defers the effective date of SFAS 133 from fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 1999 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  Earlier
application of SFAS 133, as amended, is encouraged but should not be applied
retroactively to financial statements of prior periods.  In June 2000, the
FASB issued


                                      18

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 19

Statement of Financial Accounting Financial Standards No. 138, Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, which
addresses certain issues causing implementation difficulties.   The Company
has adopted SFAS 133, as amended, effective January 1, 2001, but since the
Company does not participate in any derivative or hedging activities, SFAS
133, as amended, had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial
position and results of operations, except for the transfer of all
held-to-maturity securities into available-for-sale as of January 1, 2001.

INFLATION

Inflation can impact the financial position and results of the operations of
banks and bank holding companies because these companies hold monetary assets
and monetary liabilities.  Monetary assets and liabilities are those which
can be converted into a fixed number of dollars, and include cash,
investments, loans and deposits.  The Company's consolidated balance sheets
reflects a net positive monetary position (monetary assets exceeding monetary
liabilities).  During periods of inflation, the holding of a net positive
monetary position will result in an overall decline in the purchasing power
of a company.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS - FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

Statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations and the other sections of this Report that are not
statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements.  Such
statements are subject to important risks and uncertainties which could cause
the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any
such forward-looking statements made herein.  The aforesaid uncertainties
include, but are not limited to: burdens imposed by federal and state
regulators, credit risk related to borrowers' ability to repay loans,
concentration of loans in the St. Louis Metropolitan area which subjects the
Company to risks associated with changes in the local economy, risks
associated with fluctuations in interest rates, competition from other banks
and other financial institutions, some of which are not as heavily regulated
as the Company and risks associated with breakdowns in data processing
systems and competition from other providers of similar services.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000 and 1999

NOTE 1
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company provides information services which include processing and
payment of freight and utility charges, preparation of transportation
management reports, auditing of freight charges and rating of freight
shipments.  The Company is subject to competition from other commercial
concerns providing similar services to companies throughout the United States
and Canada.  The consolidated balance sheet caption "Accounts and Drafts
Payable," consists of obligations related to bill payment services which are
performed for customers.

The Company also provides a full range of banking services to individual,
corporate and institutional customers through its wholly owned subsidiary
bank.  The Bank is subject to competition from other financial and
nonfinancial institutions throughout the metropolitan St. Louis, Missouri
area.  Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to the regulations
of certain federal and state agencies and undergo periodic examinations by
those regulatory agencies.

On January 9, 2001 the Company's subsidiary, Cass Information Systems, Inc.
was merged into the parent company, Cass Commercial Corporation, and the
parent's name was subsequently changed to Cass Information Systems, Inc.

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries
conform to accounting policies generally accepted in the United States of
America.  The following is a description of the more significant of those
policies.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination
of intercompany transactions.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Company management is
required to make estimates and assumptions which significantly affect the
reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. A significant
estimate which is particularly susceptible to change in a short period of
time is the determination of the allowance for loan losses.

INVESTMENT IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES  At the time of purchase, debt
securities are classified into one of two categories: available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which the
Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. All equity
securities, and debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity, are
classified as available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Held-to-maturity
securities are recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for the amortization of
premiums or discounts. Unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax
effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and
reported as accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on the
sale of available-for-sale securities are determined using the specific
identification method.

A decline in the fair value of any available-for-sale or held-to-maturity
security below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to
earnings and results in the establishment of a new cost basis for the
security.

The Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the
Federal Reserve Bank. The stock is recorded at cost, which represents
redemption value.  The Bank has elected to become a member of the Federal
Home Loan Bank and invested in its common stock which is recorded at cost,
which represents redemption value.

INTEREST ON LOANS  Interest on loans is recognized based upon the principal
amounts outstanding. It is the Company's policy to discontinue the accrual of
interest when there is reasonable doubt as to the collectibility of principal
or interest. Subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to
principal if there is any doubt as to the collectibility of such principal;
otherwise, these receipts are recorded as interest income. The accrual of
interest on a loan is resumed when the loan is current as to payment of both
principal and interest and/or the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay
and remain current.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES  The allowance for loan losses is increased by
provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge-offs. The provisions
charged to expense are based on economic conditions, past losses, collection
experience, risk characteristics of the portfolio and such other factors
which, in management's judgment, deserve current recognition.

                                       24

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 25


Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb
losses in the loan portfolio. While management uses all available information
to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be
necessary based on changes in economic conditions. Additionally, various
regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process,
periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies
may require the Company to increase the allowance for loan losses based on
their judgments and interpretations about information available to them at
the time of their examination.

INFORMATION SERVICES REVENUE  Revenue from freight and utility related
services is recognized when fees are billed to customers, generally monthly.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT  Premises and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, or the respective lease terms for
leasehold improvements, using straight-line and accelerated methods.
Estimated useful lives are 31-1/2 to 39 years for buildings, 8 to 10 years for
leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures, equipment
and software. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and
fair value in excess of cost of net assets acquired have resulted from
business acquisitions which were accounted for using the purchase method.
The premiums and discounts related to the fair value adjustments are
amortized using the level-yield method.

Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and fair value in excess
of cost of net assets acquired are amortized on a straight-line basis over 3
to 15 years.

Periodically, the Company reviews its intangible assets for events or changes
in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may
not be recoverable.  Based on those reviews, adjustments of recorded amounts
have not been required.

INCOME TAXES  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.

CASH FLOWS  For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the
Company considers due from banks, federal funds sold and other short-term
investments to be cash equivalents.

RECLASSIFICATIONS  Certain amounts in the 1999 and 1998 consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the 2000
presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on previously reported
net income.


NOTE 2
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital
requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet
minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly
additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could
have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must
meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of
assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under
regulatory accounting practices. The Company and the Bank's capital amounts
and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the
regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy
require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of
total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier I capital to
average assets. Management believes as of December 31, 2000, the Company and
the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action. The most recent notification from the regulatory agencies, dated
December 15, 2000, categorized the Bank as well capitalized. To be
categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total
risk-based, Tier I risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set


                                        25

forth in the table below. There are no conditions or events since that
notification that management believes have changed the Bank's category.

Subsidiary dividends are a principal source of funds for payment of dividends
by the Company to its shareholders. The Bank is subject to regulations which
require the maintenance of minimum capital levels. At December 31, 2000,
unappropriated retained earnings of $424,000 were available at the Bank for
the declaration of dividends to the Company without prior approval from
regulatory authorities.

Restricted funds on deposit used to meet regulatory reserve requirements
amounted to approximately $2,053,000 and $4,522,000 at December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

The Company and the Bank's actual and required capital amounts and ratios as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

The Company originates commercial, industrial, real estate and installment
loans to businesses, churches and consumers throughout the metropolitan St.
Louis area. The Company also originates church and church-related loans
outside the metropolitan St. Louis area. The Company does not have any
particular concentration of credit in any one economic sector; however, a
substantial portion of the commercial and industrial loans are extended to
privately held commercial companies in this market area, and are generally
secured by the assets of the business. The Company also has a substantial
portion of real estate loans that are extended to churches, in this market
area and selected cities throughout the United States, which are secured by
mortgages.

Loan transactions involving executive officers and directors of the Company
and its subsidiaries and loans to affiliates of executive officers and
directors for the year ended December 31, 2000, are summarized below. Such
loans were made in the normal course of business on substantially the same
terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the
same time for comparable transactions with other persons, and did not involve
more than the normal risk of collectibility.

NOTE 7
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which covers
substantially all of its employees. The Company's subsidiaries accrue and
make contributions designed to fund normal service costs on a current basis
using the projected unit credit with service proration method to amortize
prior service costs arising from improvements in pension benefits and
qualifying service prior to the establishment of the plan over a period of
approximately 30 years.

The pension cost for 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $386,000, $784,000 and $517,000,
respectively, and included the following components:

</TABLE>

At December 31, 2000, 57,337 shares were exercisable with a weighted average
exercise price of $11.11.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the stock option plan
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25), and accordingly, recognizes no
compensation expense as the exercise price of the Company's employee stock
options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
The Company elected not to adopt the recognition provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS 123). An entity that
continues to apply APB 25 shall disclose certain pro forma information as if
the fair value-based accounting method in SFAS 123 had been used to account
for stock-based compensation costs. The required disclosure provisions of
SFAS 123 are provided in the table below.  The Company uses the Black-Scholes
option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options at the
date of grant using the related assumptions as presented in the following
table:

A valuation allowance would be provided on deferred tax assets when it is
more likely than not that some portion of the assets will not be realized.
The Company has not established a valuation allowance at December 31, 2000 or
1999, due to management's belief that all criteria for recognition have been
met, including the existence of a history of taxes paid sufficient to support
the realization of deferred tax assets.


NOTE 10
CONTINGENCIES

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various pending legal
actions and proceedings in which claims for damages are asserted. Management,
after discussion with legal counsel, believes the ultimate resolution of
these legal actions and proceedings will not have a material effect upon the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.


NOTE 11
DISCLOSURES ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.
These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial
letters of credit and standby letters of credit. The Company's exposure to
credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the
financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of
credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual
amounts of those instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued
by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
These off-balance-sheet financial instruments generally have fixed expiration
dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since
some of the financial instruments may expire without being drawn upon, the
total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are subject to the same
underwriting standards as those financial instruments included on the
consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates each customer's
credit-worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained,
if deemed necessary upon extension of the credit, is based on management's
credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but is generally
accounts receivable, inventory, residential or income-producing commercial
property or equipment.

Conditional commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit and
standby letters of credit totaled approximately $16,958,000, $22,000 and
$3,542,000, respectively, at December 31, 2000 and approximately $24,438,000,
$99,000 and $4,756,000, respectively at December 31, 1999.

======================================================================================================
</TABLE>

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

CASH AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS For cash and cash equivalents, accrued
interest receivable, accounts and drafts payable, short-term borrowings and
accrued interest payable, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of
fair value because of the demand nature or short maturities of these
instruments.

INVESTMENT IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES Fair values are based on quoted
market prices or dealer quotes.

LOANS The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash
flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to
borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

DEPOSITS The fair value of demand deposits, savings deposits and certain
money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date.
The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using
the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The
fair value estimates above do not include the benefit that results from the
low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of
borrowing funds in the market nor the benefit derived from the customer
relationship inherent in existing deposits.

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT The fair value of
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are estimated
using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking
into account the remaining terms of the agreements, the likelihood of the
counterparties drawing on such financial instruments and the present
credit-worthiness of such counterparties. The Company believes such
commitments have been made at terms which are competitive in the markets in
which it operates; however, no premium or discount is offered thereon and,
accordingly, the Company has not assigned a value to such instruments for
purposes of this disclosure.

LIMITATIONS Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and
off-balance-sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the
value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities
that are not considered financial instruments. Other significant assets or
liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include
premises and equipment and the benefit that results from the low-cost funding
provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds
in the market (core deposit intangible). In addition, tax ramifications
related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a
significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in
any of the estimates.

Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial
instruments, fair value estimates are based on management's judgments
regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk
characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

NOTE 12
INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION

The services provided by the Company are classified into two industry
segments: Information Services and Banking Services which are more fully
discussed in Note One. The Company maintains separate financial statements
for each of these segments which identify each segment's assets and net
income. Revenue from the Banking Services segment is derived primarily from
net interest income, which includes both interest income and interest
expense.  Revenue from the Information Services segment is derived primarily
from interest income and fees from its freight and utility payment, rating
and processing services.

Summarized information about the Company's operations in each industry as of
and for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, is as follows:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders Cass Information Systems, Inc.:
    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cass
Information Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows
and shareholders' equity and comprehensive income for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 2000. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cass
Information Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
