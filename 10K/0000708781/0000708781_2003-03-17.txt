ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Description of Business

Cass Information Systems, Inc. ("Cass" or "the Company") is a leading provider
of payment and information processing services to large manufacturing,
distribution and retail enterprises across the United States. The Company
provides freight invoice rating, payment, audit, cost accounting and
transportation information to many of the nation's largest companies. It is also
the leading processor and payer of utility invoices in the United States,
including electricity, gas, water, telephone and refuse collection. Cass
extracts, stores and presents information from freight and utility invoices,
assisting our customers' traffic and energy managers in making decisions that
will enable them to improve their operating performance. Cass utilizes Internet
technologies such as web-based applications and browsers in all of its systems.
It heavily utilizes electronic commerce in transferring over $10 billion in
transactions annually and integrates financial and transaction processing into a
single process. As an information processing company, Cass focuses on these
critical business areas: Data Acquisition, Data Warehousing and Data Delivery.
The Company receives data from multiple sources, electronic and otherwise, and
processes the data to accomplish specific operating requirements of its
customers. It then makes the data available in a central repository for access
and archiving. Finally, the data is turned into information through the
Company's databases that communicate with clients as required and provide
internet-based methods and tools for analytical processing. In addition, the
Company, through its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Cass Commercial Bank ("the
Bank"), provides banking services in the commercial, industrial and residential
areas it serves. Its primary focus is to support the Company's payment
operations, and it also provides banking services to its target markets, which
include privately-owned businesses and churches and church-related ministries.
Services include commercial, real estate and personal loans; checking, savings
and time deposit accounts and other cash management services.

An important component of the Company's services is the financial control and
stability provided by the Bank for handling the billions of dollars of payments
and the infrastructure for electronic funds transfers (EFT). Cass Commercial
Bank is organized as a Missouri trust company with banking powers and was
founded in 1906. Its principal banking office is located at 13001 Hollenberg
Drive, Bridgeton, Missouri, 63044 and it has four other branches in the St.
Louis, Missouri metropolitan area. Due to its ownership of a federally insured
commercial bank, the Registrant is a bank holding corporation and was originally
organized in 1982 as Cass Commercial Corporation under the laws of Missouri and
approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank (the "FRB") in
February 1983. The Company changed its name to Cass Information Systems, Inc. in
January 2001. The principal offices of the Company are also at 13001 Hollenberg
Drive, Bridgeton, Missouri. Other operating locations are in Columbus, Ohio and
Boston, Massachusetts.

Marketing, Customers and Competition

The Company believes it is the largest firm in the freight bill payment industry
in the United States based on the total dollars of freight bills paid.
Competition consists of two primary competitors and numerous small freight bill
audit firms located throughout the United States. While offering freight payment
services, few of these audit firms compete on a national basis. The Company also
competes with other companies, located throughout the United States, that pay
utility bills and provide management reporting. Available data indicates that
the Company is one of the largest providers of utility information processing
and payment services. Due to the fact that this is a new market, the competitive
environment for utility bill processing and payment is difficult to assess and
is changing rapidly. Cass is unique among these competitors in that it is not
exclusively affiliated with any one energy service provider (ESP). In January
2001, the Company purchased the assets of "The Utility Navigator(R)", a division
of privately-held Insite Services, Inc. for $750,000. This acquisition added new
ESP's which market the Company's product as well as provided additional
processing growth.

The Company's bank subsidiary encounters competition from other banks located
throughout the St. Louis metropolitan area and other areas in which the Bank
competes. Savings banks, credit unions, other financial institutions and
non-bank providers of financial services also provide competition. The principal
competition however, is represented by large bank holding companies that are
able to offer a wide range of banking and related services through extensive
branch networks.

The Company holds several trademarks for the payment and rating services it
provides. These include: FreightPay(R), Transdata(R), TransInq(R), Ratemaker(R),
Rate Advice(R), First Rate(R), Best Rate(R) and Rate Exchange(R).


                                       1
<PAGE>

The Company is not dependent on any one customer for a significant portion of
its business. It has a varied client base with no individual client exceeding
10% of total revenue. The Bank is also not dependent on any one customer. The
Bank does however, target its services to privately-held businesses located in
the St. Louis, Missouri area and church and church-related institutions located
in St. Louis, Missouri and other selected cities located throughout the United
States.

Employees

The Company had 599 full-time and 138 part-time employees as of December 31,
2002. Of these employees, the bank subsidiary had 66 full-time and 8 part-time
employees.

Supervision and Regulation

The Company and its bank subsidiary are extensively regulated under federal and
state law. These laws and regulations are intended to protect depositors, not
shareholders. The Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Missouri
Division of Finance, the FRB and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
"FDIC"). The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and as such, it is subject to
regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB. The Company is required to
file quarterly and annual reports with the FRB and to provide to the FRB such
additional information as the FRB may require, and it is subject to regular
inspections by the FRB. Bank regulatory agencies use Capital Adequacy Guidelines
in their examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks. If the
capital falls below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, the
agencies may force certain remedial action to be taken. The Capital Adequacy
Guidelines are of several types and include risk-based capital guidelines, which
are designed to make capital requirements more sensitive to various risk
profiles and account for off-balance sheet exposure; guidelines which consider
market risk, which is the risk of loss due to change in value of assets and
liabilities due to changes in interest rates; and guidelines that use a leverage
ratio which places a constraint on the maximum degree of risk to which a bank
holding company may leverage its equity capital base. For further discussion of
the capital adequacy guidelines and ratios, please refer to Item 7 "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and
Item 8, Note 2 of this report.

The FRB also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies,
including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to
issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company
divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement
actions may be initiated for violations of law or regulations or for unsafe or
unsound practices. Both the FRB and Missouri Division of Finance also have
restrictions on the amount of dividends that banks and bank holding companies
may remit.

As a bank holding company, the Company must obtain prior approval from the FRB
before acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of
another bank or bank holding company or acquiring all or substantially all of
the assets of such a company. In many cases, prior approval is also required for
the Company to engage in similar acquisitions involving a non-bank company or to
engage in new non-bank activities. Any change in applicable laws or regulations
may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company.

Website Availability of SEC Reports

Cass will, as soon as practicable after they are electronically filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, make available free of charge on its website
each of its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current
Reports of Form 8-K, all amendments to those reports, and its definitive proxy
statements. The address of Cass's website is: www.cassinfo.com.

segment, for the three years ended December 31, 2002 are set forth in Item 8,
Note 14 of this report.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The Company's headquarters are located at 13001 Hollenberg Drive, Bridgeton,
Missouri. This location is owned by the Company, and includes a building with
approximately 61,500 square feet of office space, 20,500 of which is occupied by
the Bank. In March 2001, the Company moved into its newly-owned production
facility of approximately 45,500 square feet located at 2675 Corporate Exchange
Drive, Columbus, Ohio. The Company operates an additional production facility in
Lowell, Massachusetts where approximately 25,800 square feet of office space is
leased through October 31, 2005.

The Company's bank subsidiary's headquarters are also located at 13001
Hollenberg Drive, Bridgeton, Missouri, 63044. The Bank leases approximately
20,500 square feet of the 61,500 square foot building owned by the Company. In
addition, the Bank owns a banking facility near downtown St. Louis that consists
of approximately 1,600 square feet with adjoining drive-up facilities. The Bank
has additional leased facilities in Maryland Heights, Missouri (2,500 square
feet); Fenton, Missouri (1,250 square feet) and Chesterfield, Missouri (2,850
square feet).

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to their businesses.
Management believes none of these proceedings, if determined adversely, would
have a material effect on the business or financial condition of the Company or
its subsidiaries.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

The following presents management's discussion and analysis of the Company's
consolidated financial condition and results of operations as of the dates and
for the periods indicated. This discussion should be read in conjunction with
Item 1 "Business", Item 6 "Selected Consolidated Financial Data", the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in Item 8 and
other financial data appearing in this report.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this
report in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (U.S. GAAP). In preparing the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. There can be no assurances that actual results will not differ
from those estimates.

Management has identified the accounting policy related to the allowance for
loan losses as critical to the understanding of the Company's results of
operations, since the application of this policy requires significant management
assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different amounts to
be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change. The impact
and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations
are discussed in the " Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses" section of this
report.

In addition, management evaluates certain long-term assets such as premises and
equipment, goodwill, and foreclosed assets for impairment. Generally,
recognition of impairment is required when events and circumstances indicate
that the carrying amounts of these assets will not be recoverable in the future.
If impairment occurs, various methods of measuring impairment may be called for
depending on the circumstances and type of asset, including quoted market
prices, estimates based on similar assets, and estimates based on valuation
techniques such as discounted projected cash flows. Assets held for sale are
carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. The application
of this policy also requires significant management assumptions and estimates
that could result in materially different results if conditions or underlying
circumstances change.

Net Income Summary

The 2002 results compared to 2001 include the following significant pre-tax
components:

      Net interest income after provision for loan losses decreased $3,406,000
      or 10.6% due primarily to the decrease in the general level of interest
      rates and partially due to an increase of $440,000 in the provision for
      loan losses. The increase in the provision for loan losses was due to many
      factors including the increase in nonperforming loans and the size of the
      loan portfolio. The decrease in net interest income from these factors was
      significantly offset by an increase in tax-exempt securities, expansion of
      the loan portfolio and increase in earning assets.

      Total noninterest income increased $4,787,000 or 20.6%. Total freight and
      utility payment and processing fees increased $3,870,000 or 19.2%, with an
      increase of $2,188,000 or 49.0% in utility payment and processing fees and
      $1,682,000 or 10.7% in freight payment and processing fees. The increase
      in utility payment and processing fees relates to the rapid expansion of
      the customer base. During 2002 the Company processed over 3.4 million
      utility transactions representing over $2.6 billion of invoice value. The
      increase in freight payment and processing fees relates to new customers
      and new services. Freight rating service fees were down $738,000 or 54.7%
      due to the discontinuance of the sale and maintenance of rating software.
      These software products were replaced with the new Internet-based service
      "Ratemaker". Ratemaker fees increased $210,000 or 52.4%. Bank service fees
      increased $137,000 or 9.0% due to an expansion of the Bank's customer base
      and the fact that service fees increase as the value of noninterest
      bearing deposits, used to compensate the Bank for services provided,
      decrease as the general level of interest rates decrease. The Company also
      recognized gains of $1,477,000 from the sales of securities in 2002.

      Total noninterest expense increased $1,846,000 or 4.1% due to several
      factors. The most significant was salaries and benefits, which increased
      $936,000 or 3.1% due to an increase in staff in the transportation and
      utility processing divisions to accommodate the increase in production and
      an increase in pension and health insurance expense. Second, equipment
      expense increased $479,000 or 12.5% primarily due to an increased
      investment in information technology. Finally, other noninterest expense
      increased $589,000 or 6.7% due to increases in various other miscellaneous
      expenses such as postage, printing and professional fees.

The 2001 results compared to 2000 include the following significant pre-tax
components:

Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased $1,120,000 or 3.6%
due primarily to a $42,479,000 increase in average earning assets, including a
$48,313,000 increase in average loans outstanding and a decrease in the
provision for loan losses of $690,000. The increase in net interest income from
these factors offset the negative effect of the decrease in the general level of
interest rates.


                                       5
<PAGE>

      Total noninterest income increased $2,129,000 or 10.1% due to several
      factors. Total freight and utility payment and processing fees increased
      $2,052,000 or 11.3%, with an increase of $2,234,000 or 100.2% in utility
      payment and processing fees and offset by a $182,000 or 1.1% decrease in
      revenue from freight payment and processing services. The increase in
      utility payment and processing fees relates to the rapid expansion of the
      customer base. At the end of 2001 the Company processed over 2.7 million
      utility transactions representing nearly $2.5 billion of invoice value.
      The decrease in revenue from freight payment and processing services was
      due to several factors. The most significant of these was that due to the
      slowing economy, freight shipments of its customer base decreased
      significantly from 2000. In addition, a greater percentage of payment and
      processing revenue was obtained from increased investable balances
      generated rather than from fees. Bank service fees increased $137,000 or
      9.9% due to an expansion of the Bank's customer base and the fact that
      service fees increase as the value of noninterest bearing deposits, used
      to compensate the Bank for services provided, decrease as the general
      level of interest rates decrease.

      Total noninterest expense increased $3,493,000 or 8.5% due to several
      factors. The most significant of these include salaries and benefits which
      increased $1,969,000 or 6.9% primarily due to an increased staff at the
      Company's new utility processing facility in Columbus, Ohio. Second,
      equipment expense increased $804,000 or 26.6% primarily due to an
      increased investment in information technology. Finally, outside service
      fees increased due to an increase in outsourced programming services to
      assist in the expansion of the utility payment and processing division as
      well as increased outsourcing of data entry services.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans,
investments, and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other
interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the most significant source
of the Company's revenues.

Net interest income in 2002 compared to 2001:

On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2002 totaled $30,466,000, a
decrease of $2,194,000 or 6.7% from 2001. The net interest margin for 2002 was
5.60% compared to 6.27% in 2001. The following factors account for this decrease
in net interest income and net interest margin:

      The dramatic decrease in the general level of interest rates significantly
      impacted the Company's net interest income and margin. The prime rate
      decreased from 9.50% at the beginning of 2001 to 4.75% at the end of 2001
      and 4.25% at the end of 2002. Also, the Federal funds rate ended the year
      at 1.25%, the lowest level in over 40 years. The average yield on earning
      assets decreased to 6.02% in 2002 from 7.01% in 2001. The Company is
      negatively affected by decreases in the level of interest rates due to the
      fact that its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate
      sensitive liabilities. Conversely, the Company is positively affected by
      increases in the level of interest rates. This is primarily due to the
      noninterest-bearing liabilities generated by the Company in the form of
      accounts and drafts payable. More information is contained in Item 7A of
      this report.

      The Company partially offset these decreases through both an increase in
      earning assets and shift of investments to higher yielding assets. Total
      average earning assets increased $22,737,000 or 4.4% to $544,011,000. This
      increase was funded by an increases in deposits generated by the Bank. The
      Bank saw increases in both interest bearing deposits, as a result of
      increased marketing efforts, and noninterest bearing deposits, mainly from
      bank customers that maintained higher balances to compensate the Bank for
      services and to avoid increased service fees in a lower rate environment.

      Total average loans increased $27,818,000 or 7.4% to $404,093,000. This
      increase was attributable to new business relationships and funded by the
      increase in deposit liabilities and reallocation of assets. This increase
      in loans had a positive effect on interest income and the net interest
      margin due to the fact that loans are one of the Company's highest
      yielding earning assets.

      Total average investment in debt and equity securities increased
      $25,557,000 or 35.4% to $97,668,000. In addition to this increased
      investment, the Company shifted its purchase of securities from taxable to
      tax-exempt due to the higher tax-equivalent yield such investments
      produce. This increase and shift also allowed the Company to offset the
      effect of lower interest rates.

      Total average federal funds sold and other short-term investments
      decreased $30,638,000 or 42.0% to $42,250,000. These are the lowest
      yielding earning assets so decreases in these funds have a positive effect
      on net interest margin. In another attempt to offset the effect of
      declining interest rates the Company shifted excess short-term funds to
      higher yielding investments.

Net interest income in 2001 compared to 2000:

On a tax-equivalent basis, net interest income for 2001 totaled $32,660,000, an
increase of $549,000 or 1.7% over 2000. The net interest margin for 2001 was
6.27% compared to 6.69% in 2000. The following factors account for this increase
in net interest income and decrease in net interest margin:

      Total average earning assets increased $42,479,000 or 8.9% to
      $521,274,000. This increase was funded by an increase in average accounts
      and drafts payable and an increase in deposit liabilities generated by the
      Bank. The Company's accounts and drafts payable increased due to an
      increase in dollars processed and a lengthening of the time funds were
      available for investment. The time funds are available for investment is
      negotiated by customer and is part of the compensation for providing the
      Company's services. The Bank saw an increase in both interest bearing
      deposits, as a result of increased marketing efforts, and noninterest
      bearing deposits, mainly from bank customers that maintained higher
      balances to compensate the Bank for services and to avoid increased
      service fees in a lower rate environment. The interest generated from the
      increase in average earning assets was offset by a decrease in the general
      level of interest rates.

      Total average loans increased $48,313,000 or 14.7% to $376,275,000. This
      increase was attributable to new business relationships and funded by the
      increase in payables and deposit liabilities. This increase in loans
      increased interest income and had a positive effect on the net interest
      margin due to the fact that loans are one of the Company's highest
      yielding earning assets.

      Total average federal funds sold and other short-term investments
      increased $7,004,000 or 10.6% to $72,888,000. Since these are the lowest
      yielding earning assets, increases in average balances outstanding can
      increase interest income but may lower the yield on earning assets and
      decrease the net interest margin.

      The net interest margin decreased primarily because of the dramatic
      decrease in the general level of interest rates. Prime decreased from
      9.50% at the end of 2000 to 4.75% at the end of 2001. Also, the Federal
      funds rate ended the year at 1.75%, at that time the lowest level in
      nearly 40 years. The average yield on earning assets decreased to 7.01% in
      2001 from 7.79% in 2000. The Company is negatively affected by decreases
      in the level of interest rates due to the fact that its rate sensitive
      assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive liabilities. Conversely,
      the Company is positively affected by increases in the level of interest
      rates. This is primarily due to the noninterest-bearing liabilities
      generated by the Company in the form of accounts and drafts payable. More
      information is contained in Item 7A of this report.

</TABLE>

(1)   Loans have been classified as having "floating" interest rates if the rate
      specified in the loan varies with the prime commercial rate of interest.

The Company has no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans which
are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table and
discussed in Item 8, Note 4 of this report. As can be seen in the loan
composition table above and discussed in Item 8, Note 4, the Company's primary
market niche for banking services is privately-held commercial companies and
churches and church-related ministries.

Loans to the commercial entities are generally secured by the business assets of
the company, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment,
and the building(s) from which the company operates. Operating lines of credit
to these companies generally are secured by accounts receivable and inventory,
with specific percentages of each determined on a customer by customer basis,
based on various factors including the type of business. Intermediate term
credit for machinery and equipment is generally provided at some percentage of
the value of the equipment purchased, depending on the type of machinery or
equipment purchased by the entity. Loans secured exclusively by real estate to
businesses and churches are generally made with a maximum 80% loan to value
ratio, depending upon the Company's estimate of the resale value and ability of
the property to generate cash. The Company's loan policy requires an independent
appraisal for all loans over $250,000 secured by real estate. Company management
monitors the local economy in an attempt to determine whether it has had a
significant deteriorating effect on such real estate credits. When problems are
identified, appraised values are updated on a continual basis, either internally
or through an updated external appraisal.

Loan portfolio changes from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002:

      Total loans increased $53,237,000 or 14.0% to $434,689,000. This increase
      was due mainly to the expansion of church and church-related loans in the
      St. Louis metropolitan area and selected areas across the


                                       9
<PAGE>

      United States. At year-end church and church-related real estate and
      construction credits totaled $141,532,000, which represented a 36.7%
      increase over 2001. Additional details regarding the types and maturities
      of the loan portfolio are contained in the tables above and in Item 8,
      Note 4.

Loan portfolio changes from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001:

      Total loans increased $9,232,000 or 2.5% to $381,452,000. This increase
      was due mainly to the expansion of church and church-related loans in the
      St. Louis metropolitan area and selected areas across the United States.
      At year-end church and church-related real estate and construction credits
      totaled $103,527,000, which represented a 22% increase over 2000.
      Additional details regarding the types and maturities of the loan
      portfolio are contained in the tables above and in Item 8, Note 4.

Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses

The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $500,000 in 2002, $60,000 in
2001 and $750,000 in 2000. The provisions were due to the Company's analysis of
the allowance for loan losses in relation to probable losses in the loan
portfolio. The larger provisions made in 2002 and 2000 partially resulted from
the increase in average loans outstanding and the increases in nonperforming
loans. Loan charge-offs, net of recoveries, experienced by the Company were
$113,000 in 2002, $51,000 in 2001 and $135,000 in 2000. The allowance for loan
losses was $5,293,000 at December 31, 2002, compared to $4,906,000 at December
31, 2001 and $4,897,000 at December 31, 2000. The year-end 2002 allowance
represented 1.22% of outstanding loans, compared to 1.29% at year-end 2001 and
1.32% at year-end 2000. From December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002 the level of
nonperforming loans increased $8,722,000 from $472,000 to $9,194,000, which
represents 2.12% of outstanding loans. Nonperforming loans are more fully
explained in the section entitled "Nonperforming Assets" in Item 7 of this
report.

The allowance for loan losses has been established and is maintained to absorb
losses inherent in the loan portfolio. An ongoing assessment of risk of loss is
performed to determine if the current balance of the allowance is adequate to
cover probable losses in the portfolio. A charge or credit is made to expense to
cover any deficiency or reduce any excess. The current methodology employed to
determine the appropriate allowance consists of two components, specific and
general. The Company develops specific valuation allowances on commercial,
commercial real estate, and construction loans when a loan is considered to be
impaired. A loan is impaired when, based on an evaluation of current information
and events, it is probable that the Company will not be able to collect all
amounts due (principal and interest) pursuant to the original contractual terms.
The Company measures impairment based upon the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate or the fair
value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The general
component relates to all other loans, which are evaluated based on loan grade.
The loan grade assigned to each loan is typically evaluated on an annual basis,
unless circumstances require interim evaluation. The Company assigns a reserve
amount consistent with each loan's rating category. The reserve amount is based
on loss experience over prescribed periods. In addition to the amounts derived
from the loan grades, a portion is added to the general reserve to take into
account other factors including national and local economic conditions,
downturns in specific industries including loss in collateral value, trends in
credit quality at the Company and the banking industry, and trends in risk
rating changes. As part of their examination process, federal and state agencies
review the Company's methodology for maintaining the allowance for loan losses
and the balance in the account. These agencies may require the Company to
increase the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and
interpretations about information available to them at the time of their
examination.

Nonperforming Assets

It is the policy of the Company to continually monitor its loan portfolio and to
discontinue the accrual of interest on any loan on which payment of principal or
interest in a timely manner, in the normal course of business, is doubtful.
Subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to principal if there is
any doubt as to the collectibility of such principal; otherwise, these receipts
are recorded as interest income. Interest on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans,
which would have been recorded under the original terms of the loans, was
approximately $346,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Of this amount,
approximately $328,000 was actually recorded as interest income on such loans.

At December 31, 2002, after review of potential problem loans identified by
management, including those noted in the table below, management of the Company
concluded the allowance for loan losses was adequate. As of December 31, 2002,
approximately $2,994,000 of loans not included in the table below were
identified by management as having potential credit problems, resulting in a
total of $12,188,000 in impaired loans. These loans are excluded from the table
due to the fact that they are current under the original terms of the loans, but
circumstances have raised doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply
with the loan repayment terms.

The total renegotiated loans of $4,252,000 at December 31, 2002 relates to two
borrowers, both of which are current under the new terms of the loans and are
considered performing as of January 1, 2003. The real-estate mortgage loans of
$3,388,000 and other loans of $1,503,000 contractually past due 90 days or more
relate to one borrower and these loans have been fully paid-off subsequent to
year-end.

The total foreclosed assets of $6,241,000 at December 31, 2002 consist of two
parcels of real estate and a $5,298,000 investment in a software company. On
January 2, 2001, the Bank foreclosed on certain operating assets relating to one
borrower in order to protect its financial interests. This borrower was a
software company that provided the public sector with integrated financial,
property and human resource management systems. The Bank sold these assets to a
wholly-owned subsidiary, Government e-Management Solutions, Inc. (GEMS) and
invested in and stabilized this business. GEMS generated $5,526,000 in revenues
and incurred $5,997,000 in operating expenses for the year ended December 31,
2002. From the date of foreclosure through December 31, 2002 these assets have
been accounted for as a foreclosed asset that is held for sale. Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", adopted by the Company on January 1, 2002,
requires that if certain criteria are not met for long-lived asset (disposal)
groups classified as held for sale by the end of the fiscal year in which SFAS
144 is initially applied, the related long-lived assets shall be reclassified as
held and used. Therefore, as of January 1, 2003, the Company will reclassify the
foreclosed assets relating to GEMS as held and used and consolidate its
operations into those of the Company.

The Bank currently has two properties which it is carrying as other real estate
owned at what management believes to be fair value less cost to sell of the
property. The first property was foreclosed on August 8, 2001 and is recorded at
$680,000. The second property was foreclosed on December 19, 2002 and is
recorded at $263,000, which was the remaining balance of the related loan at the
time of foreclosure.

The Company does not have any foreign loans. The Company's loan portfolio does
not include a significant amount of single family real estate mortgage or
installment credits, as the Company does not market its services to retail
customers.

The Company does not have any other interest-earning assets which would have
been included in nonaccrual, past due or restructured loans if such assets were
loans.

Noninterest Income

The Company's noninterest income is derived mainly from freight and utility
payment and processing fees. As the Company provides its freight and utility
processing and payment services, it is compensated by service fees which are
typically calculated on a per-item basis and by the accounts and drafts payable
generated in the payment process which can be used to generate interest income.
Processing volumes related to fees and accounts and drafts payable for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 are as follows:

In addition to payment processing fees, the Company also received fees from the
sale, maintenance, and service operations relating to freight rating software.
After December 31, 2001 the Company ceased the sale and maintenance of its
rating software and replaced this product with its web-based Ratemaker product,
which generates revenue from subscription and related service fees. Other
noninterest revenue is generated in the form of fees that relate to the credit,
depository, and cash management products of the Bank. Customers compensate the
Bank for these services through fees, the maintenance of demand deposit
balances, or both.

Noninterest income in 2002 compared to 2001 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

      Freight and utility payment and processing revenue increased $3,870,000 or
      19.2% to $24,012,000. Of the total payment and processing revenue, fees
      related to utility payment and processing increased $2,188,000 and fees
      relating to freight payment and processing services increased $1,682,000.
      These increases relate to new customers and new product offerings.

      Freight rating services revenue decreased $738,000 or 54.7% to $610,000. A
      change in the strategic direction of the Company from selling rating
      software to a new Internet-based delivery system of carrier rates occurred
      during 2000 and 2001. After December 31, 2001 the Company ceased support
      of the old product and therefore no longer recognized maintenance revenue.
      This new system offers the shipping community an expanded level of
      features, capabilities and ease of access. Fees from the new Ratemaker
      product increased $210,000 or 52.4% from 2001.

      Service fees generated by the Bank increased $137,000 or 9.0% to
      $1,659,000. This increase was due primarily to the growth of the Bank's
      customer base and the fact that service fees increase as the value of
      noninterest bearing deposits, used to compensate the Bank for services
      provided, decrease as the general level of interest rates decrease.

      The Company recorded net gains of $1,477,000 on the sales of securities
      with a fair value of $63,945,000. The sales of securities were transacted
      to adjust the portfolio to reflect the changes in the interest rate
      environment, growth in the loan portfolio during the past year and to
      offset the loss of interest income due to the dramatic decline in the
      general level of interest rates.

      Other miscellaneous noninterest income increased $41,000 or 17.7% to
      $272,000. This increase was primarily due to income recognized from the
      increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance
      purchased by the Company in 2002.

Noninterest income in 2001 compared to 2000 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

      Freight and utility payment and processing revenue increased $2,052,000 or
      11.3% to $20,142,000. Of the total payment and processing revenue, fees
      related to utility payment and processing increased $2,234,000 and fees
      relating to freight payment and processing services decreased $182,000.
      The increase in utility payment and processing fees relates to the rapid
      expansion of the customer base. During 2001 the Company processed over 2.7
      million utility transactions representing over $2.4 billion of invoice
      value. The decrease in revenue from freight payment and processing
      services was primarily due to the slowing economy, which resulted in
      freight shipments of the existing customer base decreasing significantly
      from 2000 levels. In addition, a greater percentage of payment and
      processing revenue was obtained from increased investable balances
      generated rather than from fees.

      Freight rating services revenue increased $14,000 or 1.0% to $1,348,000. A
      change in the strategic direction of the Company from selling rating
      software to a new Internet-based delivery system of carrier rates occurred
      during 2000 and 2001. This system will offer the shipping community an
      expanded level of


                                       13
<PAGE>

      features, capabilities and ease of access. The Company saw a decrease in
      revenue from its rating software maintenance fees, which it discontinued
      on December 31, 2001, but this decrease was more than offset by the fees
      generated from the new Ratemaker product.

      Service fees generated by the Bank increased $137,000 or 9.9% to
      $1,522,000. This increase was due primarily to the growth of the Bank's
      customer base and the fact that service fees increase as the value of
      noninterest bearing deposits, used to compensate the Bank for services
      provided, decrease as the general level of interest rates decrease.

      Other miscellaneous noninterest income decreased $74,000 or 24.3% to
      $231,000. This decrease was due primarily to the discontinuance of the
      sale of the Company's rating software in 2001.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in 2002 compared to 2001 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

      Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $936,000 or 3.1% to
      $31,405,000. This increase primarily relates to increased staff in both
      the transportation and utility processing divisions to accommodate the
      increase in production. The Company also experienced an increase in
      pension and health insurance expense.

      Occupancy expense decreased $158,000 or 9.5% to $1,500,000 primarily due
      to a decrease in rent expense after moving the Company's Columbus
      operations from leased space to a newly-acquired building, closing of the
      Chicago office, which was the facility used to support the rating software
      business that was discontinued in 2002 and closing one of the two bank
      subsidiary branches located in downtown St. Louis. Equipment expense
      increased $479,000 or 12.5% to $4,310,000 and other noninterest expense
      increased $589,000 or 6.7% to $9,360,000. This increase relates mainly to
      the expansion of utility payment processing capabilities, increased
      investment in freight payment processing and Internet capabilities and
      other normal operating expense fluctuations. More details on the
      components of other noninterest operating expenses are contained in Item
      8, Note 10 of this report.

Noninterest expense in 2001 compared to 2000 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

      Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $1,969,000 or 6.9% to
      $30,469,000. This increase primarily related to an increased staff at the
      Company's new utility processing facility in Columbus, Ohio. The Company
      also experienced an increase in pension and health insurance expense.

      Occupancy expense decreased $100,000 or 5.7% to $1,658,000 primarily due
      to a decrease in rent expense the Company experienced after moving the
      Company's Columbus operations from leased space to a newly acquired
      building. Equipment expense increased $804,000 or 26.6% to $3,831,000 and
      other noninterest expense increased $820,000 or 10.3% to $8,771,000. This
      increase relates mainly to the expansion of utility payment processing
      capabilities, increased investment in freight payment processing and
      Internet capabilities and other normal operating expense fluctuations.
      More details on the components of other noninterest operating expenses are
      contained in Item 8, Note 10 of this report.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense in 2002 totaled $2,987,000 compared to $3,739,000 in 2001 and
$3,861,000 in 2000. When measured as a percent of income before income taxes,
the Company's effective tax rate was 29.0% in 2002, 34.7% in 2001 and 35.1% in
2000. The primary reason for the decline in the effective rate in 2002 was the
Company's investment in tax-exempt municipal bonds and bank owned life
insurance.

Investment Portfolio

Investment portfolio changes from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002:

      The balance of $12,284,000 invested in U.S. Government Treasury securities
      at December 31, 2001 matured during 2002 and these funds were invested in
      higher-yielding securities and used to fund loan growth.

      U.S. Government corporation and agency securities decreased $50,066,000 or
      64.8% to $27,249,000. The decrease was primarily from the sales of these
      securities, which were transacted to adjust the portfolio to


                                       14
<PAGE>

      reflect the changes in the interest rate environment, accommodate growth
      in the loan portfolio and to recognize gains to offset the loss in
      interest income due to the dramatic decline in the general level of
      interest rates.

      State and political subdivision securities increased $38,824,000 to
      $40,923,000. This increase was due to the decision to invest in
      longer-term, higher-yielding investments.

Investment portfolio changes from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001:

      U.S. Government Treasury securities decreased $17,963,000 or 59.4% to
      $12,284,000. This decrease occurred due to a decision to invest in
      higher-yielding securities and fund future loan growth.

      U.S. Government corporation and agency securities increased $40,050,000 or
      107.5% to $77,313,000. This increase was due to a decision to invest in
      longer-term, higher-yielding investments, given the declining interest
      rate environment.

      State and political subdivision securities increased $918,000 or 77.7% to
      $2,099,000. This was also due to the decision to invest in longer-term,
      higher-yielding investments.

There was no single issuer of securities in the investment portfolio at December
31, 2002 other than U.S. Government corporations and agencies, for which the
aggregate amortized cost exceeded ten percent of total shareholders' equity.

Deposits and Accounts and Drafts Payable

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased $7,999,000 or 6.8% from
$117,351,000 at December 31, 2001 to $109,352,000 at December 31, 2002. The
average balances of these accounts increased $7,631,000 or 8.2% from $92,842,000
in 2001 to $100,473,000 in 2002. The decrease in ending balances relates to
normal daily fluctuations in these accounts. The increase in the average
balances relates to new business and to the fact that the earnings credit rate
on noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased with the general decline in
interest rates. In order to compensate the Bank for services rendered, customers
increased balances in those accounts, paid more in fees, or both.

Interest-bearing deposits increased from $130,627,000 at December 31, 2001 to
$134,166,000 at December 31, 2002. The average balances of these deposits
increased $18,055,000 or 14.8% from $122,112,000 in 2001 to $140,167,000 in
2002. These increases relate mainly to the Bank's increased marketing efforts to
attract more deposits.

Accounts and drafts payable generated by the Company in its payment processing
operations decreased $68,173,000 or 23.4% from $291,794,000 at December 31, 2001
to $223,621,000 at December 31, 2002. The average balances of


                                       15
<PAGE>

these funds decreased $1,166,000 or .4% from $294,608,000 in 2001 to
$293,442,000 in 2002. Due to the Company's payment processing cycle, average
balances are much more indicative of the underlying activity than period-end
balances since point-in-time comparisons can be misleading if the comparison
dates fall on different days of the week.

The composition of average deposits and the average rates paid on those deposits
is represented in the table entitled "Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and
Stockholders' Equity; Interest Rate and Interest Differential" which is included
earlier in this discussion. The Company does not have any significant deposits
from foreign depositors.

Short-term Borrowings

Short-term borrowings increased $37,238,000 from $200,000 at December 31, 2001
to $37,438,000 at December 31, 2002. Average balances of these funds increased
$1,123,000 from $362,000 during 2001 to $1,485,000 during 2002. These funds
consist primarily of federal funds purchased and can also include tax deposits
of the United States Treasury. The borrowings at December 31, 2002 were used to
fund a decrease in accounts and drafts payable, due to a combination of special
year-end funding arrangements with large customers, seasonality and the last day
of the year being the low point of the weekly payment cycle. These balances can
vary significantly from day to day due to the Company's payment cycle and
therefore balances on any particular day are not necessarily reflective of
balances throughout the year. For more information on borrowings please refer to
Item 8, Note 7 of this report.

Liquidity

The discipline of liquidity management as practiced by the Company seeks to
ensure that funds are available to fulfill all payment obligations relating to
the freight and utility invoices processed as they become due, meet depositor
withdrawal requests and borrower credit demands while at the same time
maximizing profitability. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand
for funds with changes in the supply of funds. Primary liquidity to meet demand
is provided by short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash, maturing
securities and the ability to attract funds from external sources. The Company's
Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) has direct oversight responsibility for the
Company's liquidity position and profile. Management considers both on-balance
sheet and off-balance sheet transactions in its evaluation of liquidity.

The balances of liquid assets consists of cash and cash equivalents, which
include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and money market funds, and
were $30,006,000 at December 31, 2002, a decrease of $69,849,000 or 70.0% from
December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002 these assets represented 5.2% of total
assets. These funds are the Company's and its subsidiaries' primary source of
liquidity to meet future expected and unexpected loan demand, depositor
withdrawals or reductions in accounts and drafts payable.

Secondary sources of liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing
lines. Total investment in debt and equity securities was $69,371,000 at
December 31, 2002, a decrease of $22,959,000 or 24.9% from December 31, 2001.
These assets represented 12.1% of total assets at December 31, 2002. Of this
total, 59% were state and political subdivision securities, 32% were
mortgage-backed securities, 7% were U.S. government agencies and 2% were other
securities. Of the total portfolio, none mature in one year, 10% matures in one
to five years, and 90% matures in five or more years. During the year the
Company sold securities with a market value of $63,945,000 and a portion of
these funds were reinvested in state and political subdivision securities and
the loan portfolio. At January 2, 2001 the Company transferred the remaining
balance of held-to-maturity securities into available-for-sale securities as
allowed upon the adoption of SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities". The investment portfolio provides secondary liquidity
through regularly scheduled maturities, the ability to sell securities out of
the available-for-sale portfolio, and the ability to use these securities in
conjunction with the Company's repurchase lines of credit.


                                       16
<PAGE>

The Bank has unsecured lines at correspondent banks to purchase federal funds up
to a maximum of $29,000,000. Additionally, the Bank maintains a line of credit
at an unaffiliated financial institution in the maximum amount of $40,000,000
collateralized by securities sold under repurchase agreements.

The deposits of the Company's banking subsidiary have historically been stable,
consisting of a sizable volume of core deposits related to customers that
utilize many other commercial products of the Bank. The accounts and drafts
payable generated by the Company has also historically been a stable source of
funds.

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $9,166,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2002, compared to $8,697,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Net cash used in investing activities was $40,955,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2002, compared with $43,441,000 for the year ended December 31,
2001. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002
was $38,060,000, compared with net cash provided of $18,668,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2001. The increase in net cash used in investing activities
relates primarily to the sales of securities during the year ended December 31,
2002 and was partially offset by the purchase of more debt and equity
securities, increases in loan balances and the investment in bank owned life
insurance. The increase in net cash used in financing activities compared with
net cash provided for the year ended December 31, 2001 relates primarily to the
decrease in accounts and drafts payable at December 31, 2002. Balances in
accounts and drafts payable can vary significantly from day to day due to the
Company's payment cycle and therefore balances on any one particular day are not
necessarily reflective of balances throughout the year. The decrease in accounts
and drafts payable at December 31, 2002 was partially offset by short-term
borrowings.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Activities

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to activities that
contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or
in part in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Such activities
include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments and
commitments under operating leases. For details of operating leases refer to
Item 8, Note 5 of this report.

The Company provides customers with off-balance sheet credit support through
unused loan commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and
commercial letters of credit. Summarized credit-related financial instruments,
including both commitments to extend credit and letters of credit at December
31, 2002 are as follows:

Since many of the unused commitments are expected to expire or be only partially
used, the total amount of commitments in the preceding table does not
necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Capital Resources

One of management's primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital base to
warrant the confidence of customers, shareholders, and bank regulatory agencies.
A strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable growth
opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and creditors.
The Company and its banking subsidiary continue to exceed all regulatory capital
requirements, as evidenced by the capital ratios at December 31, 2002 as shown
in Item 8, Note 2 of this report.

In 2002, cash dividends paid were $.81 per share for a total of $2,628,000, a
1.9% increase over the prior year, which is attributable to both an increase in
the per share amount paid and an increase in the number of shares outstanding.
On December 16, 2002 the Company issued a 5% stock dividend payable to holders
of record on December 5, 2002 and also paid an additional $.01 per share over
the per share amounts paid for each of the quarters of 2001 and the first three
quarter of 2002.

Shareholders' equity was $61,046,000 or 10.7% of total assets at December 31,
2002, an increase of $5,526,000 over the balance at December 31, 2001. This
increase resulted from net income of $7,312,000, an increase in other
comprehensive income of $671,000, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of
$348,000 and other items of $208,000, which was partially offset by cash
dividends paid of $2,628,000, repurchases of stock of $383,000 and $2,000 for
payments of fractional shares related to the 5% stock dividend.

Management believes that current cash, cash equivalents, maturing investments
and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund the Company's operations and
capital expenditures in 2003.

Dividends from the bank subsidiary are a significant source of funds for payment
of dividends by the Company to its shareholders. The only restrictions on
dividends are those dictated by regulatory capital requirements and prudent and
sound banking principles. As of December 31, 2002, unappropriated retained
earnings of $3,836,000 were available at the Bank for the declaration of
dividends to the Company without prior approval from regulatory authorities.

Effect of Recent and Prospective Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an
interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB
Interpretation No. 34". This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be
made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligation under
guarantees issued. The interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is
required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair
value of the obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement
provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on the
Company's consolidated financial statements. The disclosure requirements are
effective for financial statements of periods ending after December 15, 2002 and
are included in Item 8, Note 13 of this report.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and
Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123". This statement amends SFAS
123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both the
annual and interim financial statements. Certain of the disclosure modifications
are required for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and are included in
Item 8, Note 9 of this report.

Effects of Inflation

The Company's assets and liabilities are primarily monetary, consisting of cash,
cash equivalents, securities, loans, payables and deposits. Monetary assets and
liabilities are those that can be converted into a fixed number of dollars. The
Company's consolidated balance sheet reflects a net positive monetary position
(monetary assets exceed monetary liabilities). During periods of inflation, the
holding of a net positive monetary position will result in an overall decline in
the purchasing power of a company. Management believes that replacement costs of
equipment, furniture, and leasehold improvements will not materially affect
operations. The rate of inflation does affect certain expenses, such as those
for employee compensation, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of
the Company's services.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Sensitivity

The Company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and its
fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest rates.
The asset/liability management discipline as applied at the Company seeks to
limit the volatility, to the extent possible, of both net interest income and
the fair market value of equity that can result from changes in market interest
rates. This is accomplished by limiting the maturities of fixed rate
investments, loans, and deposits; matching fixed rate assets and liabilities to
the extent possible; and optimizing the mix of fees and net interest income.
However, as discussed below, the Company's asset/liability position differs
significantly from most other bank holding companies with significant positive
cumulative "gaps" shown for each time horizon presented. This asset sensitive
position is caused primarily by the operations of the Company, which generates
large balances of accounts and drafts payable. These balances, which are
noninterest bearing, contribute to the Company's high net interest margin but
cause the Company to become susceptible to changes in interest rates, with a
decreasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of
declining interest rates and an increasing net interest margin and fair market
value of equity in periods of rising interest rates.

The Company's Asset/Liability Management Committee (ALCO) measures the Company's
interest rate risk sensitivity on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage the
variability of earnings and fair market value of equity in various interest rate
environments. The ALCO evaluates the Company's risk position to determine
whether the level of exposure is significant enough to hedge a potential decline
in earnings and value or whether the Company can safely increase risk to enhance
returns. The ALCO uses gap reports, twelve-month net interest income
simulations, and fair market value of equity analyses as its main analytical
tools to provide management with insight into the Company's exposure to changing
interest rates.

A gap report is used by management to review any significant mismatch between
the repricing points of the Company's rate sensitive assets and liabilities in
certain time horizons. A negative gap indicates that more liabilities reprice in
that particular time frame and, if rates rise, these liabilities will reprice
faster than the assets. A positive gap would indicate the opposite. Gap reports
can be misleading in that they capture only the repricing timing within the
balance sheet, and fail to capture other significant risks such as basis risk
and embedded options risk. Basis risk involves the potential for the spread
relationship between rates to change under different rate environments and
embedded options risk relates to the potential for the alteration of the level
and/or timing of cash flows given changes in rates.

Another measurement tool used by management is net interest income simulation,
which forecasts net interest income during the coming twelve months under
different interest rate scenarios in order to quantify potential changes in
short term accounting income. Management has set policy limits specifying
acceptable levels of interest rate risk given multiple simulated rate movements.
These simulations are more informative than gap reports because they are able to
capture more of the dynamics within the balance sheet, such as basis risk and
embedded options risk. Simulation results illustrate that the Company's net
interest income over the next twelve months would decrease 3.1% from an
immediate and sustained parallel decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points
and increase 1.7% from a corresponding increase in interest rates.

While net interest income simulations do a good job of capturing interest rate
risk to short term earnings, they do not capture risk within the current balance
sheet beyond twelve months. The Company uses fair market value of equity
analyses to help identify longer-term risk that may reside on the current
balance sheet. The fair market value of equity is represented by the present
value of all future income streams generated by the current balance sheet. The
Company measures the fair market value of equity as the net present value of all
asset and liability cash flows discounted at forward rates suggested by the
current Treasury curve plus appropriate credit spreads. This representation of
the change in the fair market value of equity under different rate scenarios
gives insight into the magnitude of risk to future earnings due to rate changes.
Management has set policy limits relating to declines in the market value of
equity. The results of these analyses indicate that the Company's fair market
value of equity would decrease 5.8% from an immediate and sustained parallel
decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points and increase 3.9% from a
corresponding increase in interest rates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Summary of Operations The Company provides payment and information services,
which include processing and payment of freight and utility invoices,
preparation of transportation management reports, auditing of freight charges
and rating of freight shipments. The consolidated balance sheet caption,
"Accounts and Drafts Payable," consists of obligations related to the payment
services that are performed for customers. The Company also provides a full
range of banking services to individual, corporate and institutional customers
through its wholly-owned bank subsidiary.

On January 9, 2001 the Company's subsidiary, Cass Information Systems, Inc. was
merged into the parent company, Cass Commercial Corporation, and the parent's
name was subsequently changed to Cass Information Systems, Inc.

Basis of Presentation The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and
its subsidiaries conform to accounting policies generally accepted in the United
States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany
transactions. Certain amounts in the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. Such
reclassifications have no effect on previously reported net income or
shareholders' equity.

Use of Estimates In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Company
management is required to make estimates and assumptions which significantly
affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. A
significant estimate which is particularly susceptible to change in a short
period of time is the determination of the allowance for loan losses.

Investment in Debt and Equity Securities The Company classifies its debt and
equity securities as available-for-sale. Securities classified as
available-for-sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net
of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity. A
decline in the fair value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is
deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and the
establishment of a new cost basis for the security. Premiums and discounts are
amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated lives of the
securities. Interest income is recognized when earned. Gains and losses are
calculated using the specific identification method. Investments in equity
securities without readily determinable fair values are stated at cost.

Interest on Loans Interest on loans is recognized based upon the principal
amounts outstanding. It is the Company's policy to discontinue the accrual of
interest when there is reasonable doubt as to the collectibility of principal or
interest. Subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to principal if
there is any doubt as to the collectibility of such principal; otherwise, these
receipts are recorded as interest income. The accrual of interest on a loan is
resumed when the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest
and/or the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current.

Impairment of Loans A loan is considered impaired when it is probable a creditor
will be unable to collect all amounts due, both principal and interest,
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When measuring
impairment, the expected future cash flows of an impaired loan are discounted at
the loan's effective interest rate. Alternatively, impairment could be measured
by reference to an observable market price, if one exists, or the fair value of
the collateral for a collateral-dependent loan. Regardless of the historical
measurement method used, the Company measures impairment based on the fair value
of the collateral when the Company determines foreclosure is probable.
Additionally, impairment of a restructured loan is measured by discounting the
total expected future cash flows at the loan's effective rate of interest as
stated in the original loan agreement. The Company uses its nonaccrual methods
as discussed above for recognizing interest on impaired loans.

Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is increased by
provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge-offs. The provisions
charged to expense are based on economic conditions, past losses, collection
experience, risk characteristics of the portfolio and such other factors which,
in management's judgment, deserve current recognition.

Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses
in the loan portfolio. While management uses all available information to
recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary
based on changes in economic conditions. Additionally, various regulatory
agencies, as an integral part of


                                       25
<PAGE>

their examination process, periodically review the Company's allowance for loan
losses. Such agencies may require the Company to increase the allowance for loan
losses based on their judgments and interpretations about information available
to them at the time of their examination.

Information Services Revenue Revenue from freight and utility payment related
services is recognized when fees are billed to customers, generally monthly.

Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, or the respective lease terms for
leasehold improvements, using straight-line and accelerated methods. Estimated
useful lives do not exceed 40 years for buildings, 10 years for leasehold
improvements and range from 3 to 7 years for software, equipment, furniture and
fixtures. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

Foreclosed assets On January 2, 2001, the Company foreclosed on certain
operating assets to one borrower in order to protect the financial interest in
that borrower. The Bank sold these assets to a wholly-owned subsidiary and
invested in and stabilized this business. From the date of foreclosure through
December 31, 2002 these assets have been accounted for as a foreclosed asset
that is held for sale. At December 31, 2002 and 2001 other assets includes
$7,108,000 and $6,612,000, respectively and other liabilities includes
$1,810,000 and $1,502,000, respectively related to this business.

The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets", effective January 1, 2002. SFAS 144 requires that if certain
criteria are not met for long-lived asset (disposal) groups classified as held
for sale by the end of the fiscal year in which SFAS 144 is initially applied,
the related long-lived assets shall be reclassified as held and used. Therefore,
as of January 1, 2003, the Company is required to reclassify these foreclosed
assets as held and used and consolidate its operations into those of the
Company.

Other real estate, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets, is recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs. If the
fair value of other real estate declines subsequent to foreclosure, the
difference is recorded as a valuation allowance through a charge to expense.
Subsequent increases in fair value are recorded through reversal of the
valuation allowance. Expenses incurred in maintaining the properties are charged
to expense.

Intangible Assets Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and fair
value in excess of cost of net assets acquired have resulted from business
acquisitions which were accounted for using the purchase method. The Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets",
effective January 1, 2002 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for
impairment at least annually. SFAS 142 also requires that intangible assets with
definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives
to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance
with SFAS 144.

At the date of adoption, the Company had $223,000 of unamortized goodwill, which
is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
was subject to the provisions of SFAS 142. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 142,
goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years. Amortization
expense related to goodwill was $91,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Periodically, the Company reviews intangible assets for events or changes in
circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable. Based on those reviews, adjustments of recorded amounts have not
been required.

Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash
flows, the Company considers cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and
other short-term investments as segregated in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets to be cash equivalents.


                                       26

Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
number of common shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of outstanding stock
options and awards. All per share data has been restated to reflect the 5% stock
dividend distributed in December 2002.

Stock Options The Company accounts for stock options in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees". Under APB 25, if the exercise price of the Company's
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the
date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.

Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in net
unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and minimum pension
liability adjustments and is presented in the accompanying consolidated
statements of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income.

Recent and Prospective Accounting Pronouncements In November 2002, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No.
5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34". This
interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its
financial statements about its obligation under guarantees issued. The
interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the
interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December
31, 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements. The disclosure requirements are effective for
financial statements for periods ending after December 15, 2002 and are included
in Item 8, Note 13 of this report.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No.
123". This statement amends SFAS 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation",
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require
prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements.
Certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2002 and are included in Item 8, Note 9 of this report.

Note 2
Capital Requirements And Regulatory Restrictions

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements
administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional
discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under
capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital
guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain
off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The
Company and the Bank's capital amounts and classifications are also subject to
qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and
other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy
require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total
and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier I capital to average
assets. Management believes as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company and
the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action. The most recent notification from the regulatory agencies, dated
December 31, 2002, categorized the Bank as well capitalized. To be categorized
as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I
risk-based, and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There
are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes
have changed the Bank's category.

Subsidiary dividends are a significant source of funds for payment of dividends
by the Company to its shareholders. The Bank is subject to regulations which
require the maintenance of minimum capital levels. At December 31, 2002,

The weighted average discount rate and the rate of increase in future
compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the
projected benefit obligation were 7.00% and 4.00% in 2002, 7.25% and 4.00% in
2001 and 7.50% and 4.00% in 2000. The expected long-term rate of return on
assets was 8.00% in 2002, 2001 and 2000.

In addition to the above funded benefit plan, the Company has an unfunded
supplemental executive retirement plan which covers key executives of the
Company. This is a noncontributory plan in which the Company's subsidiaries make
accruals designed to fund normal service costs on a current basis using the same
method and criteria as its defined benefit plan.

The pension cost for 2002, 2001 and 2000 for the supplemental executive
retirement plan was $177,000, $220,000 and $245,000 respectively, and included
the following components:

The weighted average discount rate and the rate of increase in future
compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the
projected benefit obligation were 7.00% and 4.00% in 2002, 7.25% and 4.00% in
2001 and 7.50% and 4.00% in 2000.

The provisions of SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions", required the
Company to record an additional minimum liability of $379,000 and $638,000 at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This liability represents the amount
by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair value of
plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded. The additional liability is
offset by an intangible asset to the extent of previously unrecognized prior
service cost. The intangible assets of $379,000 and $587,000 at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively, are included in other assets on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The remaining amount at December 31, 2001 of
$51,000 is recorded, net of tax, as an accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The Company maintains a noncontributory profit sharing plan which covers
substantially all of its employees. Employer contributions are calculated based
upon formulas which relate to current operating results and other factors.
Profit sharing expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income in
2002, 2001 and 2000 was $1,632,000, $1,588,000 and $1,617,000, respectively.

The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan to provide additional
retirement benefits to substantially all employees. Contributions under the
401(k) plan for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $277,000, $260,000 and $247,000,
respectively.

Stock Option and Bonus Plans*

The Company maintains a restricted stock bonus plan which provides for the
issuance of up to 102,820 shares of common stock, the purpose of which is to
permit grants of shares, subject to restrictions, to key employees and
non-employee directors of the Company as a means of retaining and rewarding them
for long-term performance. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, 945 shares, 630 shares
and 1,260 shares, respectively, were granted at market prices of $23.33 in 2002,
$18.67 in 2001 and $19.05 in 2000. The fair value of such shares, which is based
on the market price on the date of grant, has been recorded in the consolidated
financial statements through the establishment of a contra shareholders' equity
account which is amortized to expense over the three-year vesting period.
Amortization of the restricted stock bonus awards totaled $22,000 for 2002,
$80,000 for 2001 and $81,000 for 2000. At December 31, 2002 the weighted-average
grant date fair value and weighted average contractual life for outstanding
shares of restricted stock was $21.23 and 2.3 years, respectively.

</TABLE>

At December 31, 2002, 39,679 shares were exercisable with a weighted average
exercise price of $12.32.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the stock option plan in
accordance with APB 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", and
accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense as the exercise price of the
Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock
on the date of grant. The Company elected not to adopt the recognition
provisions of the SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", as
amended by SFAS 148. An entity that continues to apply APB 25 shall disclose
certain pro forma information as if the fair value-based accounting method in
SFAS 123 had been used to account for stock-based compensation costs. The
required disclosure provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, are provided
in the table below. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
determine the fair value of the stock options at the date of grant. The weighted
average assumptions for shares granted in 2002 were: an expected life of 7
years, dividend yield of 3.52%, expected volatility of 15% and risk-free
interest rate of 3.54%. There were no grants in 2000 and 2001. The following
table represents the effect on earnings and diluted earnings per share for the
periods ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000:

A valuation allowance would be provided on deferred tax assets when it is more
likely than not that some portion of the assets will not be realized. The
Company has not established a valuation allowance at December 31, 2002 or 2001,
due to management's belief that all criteria for recognition have been met,
including the existence of a history of taxes paid sufficient to support the
realization of deferred tax assets.

Note 12
Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various pending legal actions
and proceedings in which claims for damages are asserted. Management, after
discussion with legal counsel, believes the ultimate resolution of these legal
actions and proceedings will not have a material effect upon the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Note 13
Disclosures About Financial Instruments

The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the
normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These
financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters
of credit and standby letters of credit. The Company's maximum potential
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the
financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of
credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts
of those instruments. At December 31, 2002, no amounts have been accrued for any
estimated losses for these instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commercial
and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These off-balance
sheet financial instruments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The approximate remaining
term of commercial and standby letters of credit range from less than 1 to 5
years. Since some of the financial instruments may expire without being drawn
upon, the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are subject to the same
underwriting standards as those financial instruments included on the
consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates each customer's
credit-worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if
deemed necessary upon extension of the credit, is based on management's credit
evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but is generally accounts
receivable, inventory, residential or income-producing commercial property or
equipment. In the event of nonperformance, the Company may obtain and liquidate
the collateral to recover amounts paid under its guarantees on these financial
instruments.

The following table shows conditional commitments to extend credit, standby
letters of credit and commercial letters at December 31, 2002 and 2001:

                                       37
<PAGE>

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash and Other Short-term Instruments For cash and cash equivalents, accrued
interest receivable, accounts and drafts payable, short-term borrowings and
accrued interest payable, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair
value because of the demand nature or short maturities of these instruments.

Investment in Debt and Equity Securities Fair values are based on quoted market
prices or dealer quotes.

Loans The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows
using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with
similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings deposits and certain money
market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair
value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates
currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value
estimates above do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost
funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing
funds in the market nor the benefit derived from the customer relationship
inherent in existing deposits.

Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit The fair value of
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are estimated using
the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account
the remaining terms of the agreements, the likelihood of the counterparties
drawing on such financial instruments and the present credit-worthiness of such
counterparties. The Company believes such commitments have been made at terms
which are competitive in the markets in which it operates; however, no premium
or discount is offered thereon and, accordingly, the Company has not assigned a
value to such instruments for purposes of this disclosure.

Limitations Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet
financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated
future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered
financial instruments. Other significant assets or liabilities that are not
considered financial assets or liabilities include premises and equipment and
the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit
liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market (core deposit
intangible). In addition, tax ramifications related to the realization of the
unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value
estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.

Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial
instruments, fair value estimates are based on management's judgments regarding
future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk
characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

Note 14
Industry Segment Information

The services provided by the Company are classified into three reportable
segments: Transportation Information Services, Utility Information Services, and
Banking Services. Each of these segments offers distinct services that are
marketed through different channels. They are managed separately due to their
unique service, processing and capital requirements.

The Transportation Information Services unit provides freight invoice rating,
payment, auditing, cost accounting and transportation information services to
large corporate shippers. The Utility Information Services unit processes and
pays utility invoices, including electricity, gas, water, telephone and refuse,
for large corporate entities that have many locations or are heavy users of
energy. The Banking Services unit provides banking services primarily to
privately-held businesses and churches.

The Company's accounting policies for segments are the same as those described
in Note 1 of this report. Management evaluates segment performance based on net
income after allocations for corporate expenses and income taxes. Transactions
between segments are accounted for at what management believes to be market
value. The Company initiated the reporting of information relating to the
Utility Information Services unit in 2001 due to its growth and formalization of
its existence as an operating unit. Previous period information has been
restated, when practical, to reflect this addition.


                                       38
<PAGE>

All three segments market their services within the United States and no revenue
from any customer of any segment exceeds 10% of the Company's consolidated
revenue.

Summarized information about the Company's operations in each industry segment
for the periods ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, is as follows:

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cass Information Systems, Inc.:

      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cass
Information Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2002
and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
shareholders' equity and comprehensive income for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2002. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cass
Information Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

I, Eric H. Brunngraber, Chief Financial and Accounting Officer of Cass
Information Systems, Inc., certify that:

1.    I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Cass Information
      Systems, Inc.;

2.    Based on my knowledge, this annual report does not contain any untrue
      statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
      make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
      statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by
      this annual report;

3.    Based on my knowledge, the consolidated financial statements, and other
      financial information included in this annual report, fairly present in
      all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and
      cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
      annual report;

4.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
      establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14) for the registrant and we
      have:

      a)    designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
            material information relating to the registrant, including its
            consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within
            those entities, particularly during the period in which this annual
            report is being prepared;

      b)    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
            and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date
            of this annual report (the "Evaluation Date"); and

      c)    presented in this annual report our conclusions about the
            effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based on our
            evaluation as of the Evaluation Date;

5.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on
      our most recent evaluation, to the registrant's auditors and the audit
      committee of registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
      equivalent function):

      a)    all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
            controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to
            record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
            identified for the registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in
            internal controls; and

      b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
            other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
            internal controls; and

6.    The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
      annual report whether or not there were significant changes in internal
      controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal
      controls subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation, including
      any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and
      material weaknesses.
