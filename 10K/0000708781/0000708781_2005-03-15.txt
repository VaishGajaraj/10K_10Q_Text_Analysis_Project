ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Description of Business

Cass Information Systems, Inc. ("Cass" or "the Company") is a leading provider
of payment and information processing services to large manufacturing,
distribution and retail enterprises across the United States. The Company
provides freight invoice rating, payment, audit, cost accounting and
transportation information to many of the nation's largest companies. It is also
a leading processor and payer of utility invoices in the United States,
including electricity, gas, water, and refuse collection. The Company also
processes, audits and pays telecommunication invoices and expanded its
capabilities in this market with the purchase of PROFITLAB, Inc. in August,
2004. In addition, the Company, through its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Cass
Commercial Bank ("the Bank"), provides commercial banking services. Its primary
focus is to support the Company's payment operations and provide banking
services to its target markets, which include privately-owned businesses and
churches and church-related ministries. Services include commercial, real estate
and personal loans; checking, savings and time deposit accounts and other cash
management services. The Company, through its subsidiary, Government
e-Management Solutions, Inc. ("GEMS"), also develops, licenses and installs
integrated financial, property and human resource management systems to the
public sector, primarily cities and counties. The principal offices of the
Company are at 13001 Hollenberg Drive, Bridgeton, Missouri, 63044. Other
operating locations are in Columbus, Ohio, Boston, Massachusetts and Greenville,
South Carolina. The Bank's headquarters are also located at the Bridgeton
location and operates five other branches, four in the St. Louis metropolitan
area and one in southern California. GEMS' offices are located in Ladue,
Missouri.

Company Strategy and Core Competencies

Cass is an information services company with a primary focus on processing
payables and payables-related transactions for large corporations located in the
United States. Cass possesses four core competencies that encompass most of its
processing services.

Data acquisition - This refers to the gathering of data elements from diverse,
heterogeneous sources and the building of complete databases for our customers.
Data is the raw material of the information economy. Cass gathers vital data
from complex and diverse input documents, electronic media, proprietary
databases and data feeds, including data acquired from vendor invoices as well
as customer procurement and sales systems. Through its numerous methods of
obtaining streams and pieces of raw data, Cass is able to assemble vital data
into centralized data management systems and warehouses, thus producing an
engine to create the power of information for managing critical corporate
functions and processing systems.

Data management - Once data is assembled, Cass is able to utilize the power from
derived information to produce significant savings and benefits for its clients.
This information is integrated into customers' unique financial and accounting
systems, eliminating the need for internal accounting processing and to provide
internal and external support for these critical systems. Information is also
used to produce management and exception reporting for operational control,
feedback, planning assistance and performance measurement.

Information delivery - Receiving information in the right place at the right
time and in the required format is paramount for business survival. Cass'
information delivery solutions provide reports, digital images, data files and
retrieval capabilities through the Internet or directly into customer internal
systems. Cass' proprietary Internet management delivery system is the foundation
for driving these critical functions. Transaction, operational, control, status
and processing exception information are all delivered through this system
creating an efficient, accessible and highly reliable asset for Cass customers.

Financial exchange - Since Cass is unique among its competition in that it owns
a commercial bank, it is also able to manage the movement of funds from its
customers to their suppliers. This is a distinguishing factor which clearly
requires the processing capability, operating systems and financial integrity of
a banking organization. Cass provides immediate, accurate, controlled and
protected funds management and transfer system capabilities for all of its
customers. Old and costly check processing and delivery mechanisms are replaced
with more efficient electronic cash management and funds transfer systems. Funds
are managed and protected by our top-rated financial institution.

Cass' core competencies allow it to perform the highest levels of transaction
processing in an integrated, efficient and systematic approach. Not only is Cass
able to process the transaction, it is also able to collect the data defining
the transaction and effect the financial payment governing its terms.


                                       1
<PAGE>

Cass' shared business processes - Accounting, Human Resources and Technology -
support its core competencies. Cass' accounting function provides the internal
control systems to ensure the highest levels of accountability and protection
for customers. Cass' human resources provide experienced people dedicated to
streamlining business procedures and reducing expenses. Cass' technology is
proven and reliable. The need to safeguard data and secure the efficiency, speed
and timeliness that governs its business is a priority within the organization.
The ability to leverage technology over its strategic units allows Cass the
advantage of deploying technology in a proven and reliable manner without
endangering clients' strategic business and system requirements.

These core competencies, enhanced through shared business processes, drive Cass'
strategic business units. Building upon these foundations, Cass continues to
explore new business opportunities that leverage these competencies and
processes.

Marketing, Customers and Competition

The Company is one of the largest firms in the freight bill processing and
payment industry in the United States based on the total dollars of freight
bills paid and items processed. Competition consists of two primary competitors
and numerous small freight bill audit firms located throughout the United
States. While offering freight payment services, few of these audit firms
compete on a national basis. These competitors compete mainly on price,
functionality and service levels. The Company also competes with other
companies, located throughout the United States, that pay utility bills and
provide management reporting. Available data indicates that the Company is one
of the largest providers of utility information processing and payment services.
Cass is unique among these competitors in that it is not exclusively affiliated
with any one energy service provider ("ESP"). The ESPs market the Company's
services adding value with their unique auditing, consulting and technological
capabilities. Many of Cass' services are customized with the ESPs, providing a
full-featured solution without any development costs to the ESP. There are also
many competitors that process, audit and pay telecommunication invoices located
throughout the United States.

The Bank is organized as a Missouri trust company with banking powers and was
founded in 1906. Due to its ownership of a federally insured commercial bank,
the Company is a bank holding corporation and was originally organized in 1982
as Cass Commercial Corporation under the laws of Missouri. It was approved by
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in February 1983. The
Company changed its name to Cass Information Systems, Inc. in January 2001. The
Company's bank subsidiary encounters competition from numerous banks and
financial institutions located throughout the St. Louis metropolitan area and
other areas in which the Bank competes. The principal competition however, is
represented by large bank holding companies that are able to offer a wide range
of banking and related services through extensive branch networks.

The governmental software unit, GEMS, was acquired on January 2, 2001 when the
Company's bank subsidiary foreclosed on the operating assets of a software
company in order to protect its financial interests. The Bank sold these assets
to a wholly-owned subsidiary, and invested in and stabilized this business. From
the date of foreclosure through December 31, 2002, these assets were accounted
for as a foreclosed asset held for sale. On January 1, 2003, the Company
reclassified the foreclosed assets relating to its software subsidiary, GEMS,
from held for sale to held and used and consolidated its operations into those
of the Company. GEMS markets its software applications and services to middle
market cities and counties throughout the United States. GEMS competes with
several competitors that market similar products to these governmental units.
These firms compete on price, functionality and support. No one firm appears to
have a dominant position in the marketplace.

The Company holds several trademarks for the payment and rating services it
provides. These include: FreightPay(R), Transdata(R), TransInq(R), Ratemaker(R),
Rate Advice(R), First Rate(R), Best Rate(R) and Rate Exchange(R). The Company
and its subsidiaries are not dependent on any one customer for a significant
portion of their businesses. The Company and its subsidiaries have a varied
client base with no individual client exceeding 10% of total revenue. The Bank
does however, target its services to privately-held businesses located in the
St. Louis, Missouri area and church and church-related institutions located in
St. Louis, Missouri and other selected cities located throughout the United
States.

Employees

The Company and its subsidiaries had 638 full-time and 162 part-time employees
as of December 31, 2004. Of these employees, the bank subsidiary had 64
full-time and 7 part-time employees and the bank's software subsidiary had 65
full-time and 3 part-time employees.


                                       2

Supervision and Regulation

The Company and its bank subsidiary are extensively regulated under federal and
state law. These laws and regulations are intended to protect depositors, not
shareholders. The Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Missouri
Division of Finance, the Federal Reserve Bank (the "FRB") and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). The Company is a bank holding
company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended,
and as such, it is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the
FRB. The Company is required to file quarterly and annual reports with the FRB
and to provide to the FRB such additional information as the FRB may require,
and it is subject to regular inspections by the FRB. Bank regulatory agencies
use Capital Adequacy Guidelines in their examination and regulation of bank
holding companies and banks. If the capital falls below the minimum levels
established by these guidelines, the agencies may force certain remedial action
to be taken. The Capital Adequacy Guidelines are of several types and include
risk-based capital guidelines, which are designed to make capital requirements
more sensitive to various risk profiles and account for off-balance sheet
exposure; guidelines which consider market risk, which is the risk of loss due
to change in value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates;
and guidelines that use a leverage ratio which places a constraint on the
maximum degree of risk to which a bank holding company may leverage its equity
capital base. For further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines and
ratios, please refer to Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, Note 3 of this
report.

The FRB also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies,
including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to
issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company
divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement
actions may be initiated for violations of law or regulations or for unsafe or
unsound practices. Both the FRB and Missouri Division of Finance also have
restrictions on the amount of dividends that banks and bank holding companies
may pay.

As a bank holding company, the Company must obtain prior approval from the FRB
before acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of
another bank or bank holding company or acquiring all or substantially all of
the assets of such a company. In many cases, prior approval is also required for
the Company to engage in similar acquisitions involving a non-bank company or to
engage in new non-bank activities. Any change in applicable laws or regulations
may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Cass Information Systems, Inc. provides payment and information processing
services to national manufacturing, distribution and retail enterprises from its
processing centers in St. Louis, Missouri, Columbus, Ohio, Boston, Massachusetts
and Greenville, South Carolina. The Company's services include freight invoice
rating, payment processing, auditing, and the generation of cost accounting and
transportation information. Cass also processes and pays utility invoices,
including electricity, gas and telecommunications. The Company significantly
enhanced its telecommunication processing and audit capabilities with the
acquisition of PROFITLAB, Inc. located in Greenville, South Carolina during
2004. Cass extracts, stores and presents information from freight, utility and
telecommunication invoices, assisting our customers' transportation, energy and
information technology managers in making decisions that will enable them to
improve operating performance. The Company receives data from multiple


                                       5
<PAGE>

sources, electronic and otherwise, and processes the data to accomplish the
specific operating requirements of its customers. It then provides the data in a
central repository for access and archiving. The data is finally transformed
into information through the Company's databases that allow client interaction
as required and provide Internet-based tools for analytical processing. The
Company also, through its St Louis, Missouri based bank subsidiary, provides
banking services in the St Louis metropolitan area and other selected cities in
the United States. The Company acquired Franklin Bancorp located in Orange
County, California in November 2004 and merged its subsidiary bank, Franklin
Bank of California into the Bank. This acquisition will allow the company to
establish branches in California to better serve existing customers and expand
the Bank's customer base. In addition to supporting the Company's payment
operations, the Bank also provides banking services to its target markets, which
include privately owned businesses and churches and church-related ministries.
The Company, through the Bank's subsidiary, GEMS, also develops and licenses
integrated financial, property and human resource management systems to the
public sector.

The specific payment and information processing services provided to each
customer are developed individually to meet each customer's specific
requirements. These requirements can vary greatly from customer to customer. In
addition, the degree of automation such as electronic data interchange ("EDI"),
imaging, and web-enhanced solutions varies greatly among customers and
industries. These factors combine so that pricing varies greatly among the
customer base. In general however, Cass is compensated for its processing
services through service fees and account balances that are generated during the
payment process. The amount, type and calculation of service fees vary greatly
by service offering, but generally follow the volume of transactions processed.
Interest income from the balances generated during the payment processing cycle
is affected by the amount of time Cass holds the funds prior to payment and the
dollar volume processed. Both the number of transactions processed and the
dollar volume processed are therefore key metrics followed by management. Other
factors will also influence revenue and profitability, such as changes in the
general level of interest rates which has a significant affect on net interest
income. The funds generated by these processing activities are invested in
overnight investments, investment grade securities and loans generated by the
Bank. The Bank earns most of its revenue from net interest income, or the
difference between the interest earned on its loans and investments and the
interest expense on its deposits. The Bank also assesses fees on other services
such as cash management services. GEMS earns most of its revenue from the
license of its enterprise software solutions and its installation and
maintenance services.

Industry-wide factors that impact the Company include the acceptance by large
corporations of the outsourcing of key business functions such as freight,
utility and telecommunication payment and audit. The benefits that can be
achieved by outsourcing transaction processing and the management information
generated by Cass' systems can be influenced by factors such as the competitive
pressures within industries to improve profitability, the general level of
transportation costs, deregulation of energy costs and consolidation of
telecommunication providers. Economic factors that impact the Company include
the general level of economic activity that can affect the volume and size of
invoices processed, the ability to hire and retain qualified staff and the
growth and quality of our loan portfolio. The general level of interest rates
has a significant effect on the revenue of the Company. Finally, the general
fiscal condition of the counties and municipalities that can benefit from GEMS'
enterprise software can impact licenses sold and related revenue.

Currently, management views Cass' major opportunity and challenge as the
continued expansion of its payment and information processing service offerings
and customer base. Management intends to accomplish this by maintaining the
Company's lead in applied technology, which, when combined with the security and
processing controls of the Bank, makes Cass unique in the industry. This trend
has been positive over the past years and management anticipates that this
should continue in 2005. The low level of interest rates has had a significant
negative impact on net income over the past few years. The general level of
interest rates, particularly short term interest rates, began to increase during
2004 and had a positive effect on the Company's net interest income during the
latter part of the year. If these rates continue to rise, this positive impact
on net interest income and net earnings should continue. Management had been
pleased over the past few years with the growth in revenue generated by GEMS.
However, during 2004, the sales of new systems declined sharply due mainly to a
sluggish marketplace. Despite the decline, the Company continues to invest in
system improvements and product enhancements and anticipates that 2005 should
reflect improved results. Management intends to continue to refine risk
management practices, monitor and manage the quality of the loan portfolio and
maintain a strong financial and liquidity position.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this
report in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S.
GAAP"). In preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates have been
generally accurate in the


                                       6
<PAGE>

past, they have been consistent and have not required any material changes.
There can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those
estimates. Certain accounting policies that require significant management
estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial
position have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
and are described below.

Allowance for Loan Losses. The Company performs periodic and systematic detailed
reviews of its loan portfolio to assess overall collectability. The level of the
allowance for loan losses reflects management's estimate of the collectability
of the loan portfolio. Although these estimates are based on established
methodologies for determining allowance requirements, actual results can differ
significantly from estimated results. These policies affect all segments of the
Company with the exception of governmental software services. The impact and
associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are
discussed in the " Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses" section of this
report.

Impairment of Assets. Management periodically evaluates certain long-term assets
such as intangible assets including goodwill, foreclosed assets, internally
developed software and investments in private equity securities for impairment.
Generally, these assets are initially recorded at cost, and recognition of
impairment is required when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts of these assets will not be recoverable in the future. If impairment
occurs, various methods of measuring impairment may be called for depending on
the circumstances and type of asset, including quoted market prices, estimates
based on similar assets, and estimates based on valuation techniques such as
discounted projected cash flows. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower
of cost or fair value less costs to sell. These policies affect all segments of
the Company and require significant management assumptions and estimates that
could result in materially different results if conditions or underlying
circumstances change.

Results of Operations

The results of 2004 compared to 2003 include the following significant items:

      Information services payment and processing revenues increased $2,255,000
      or 8% to $30,695,000 as the number of transactions processed increased
      747,000 or 3% to 28,724,000. This increase was driven by the expansion of
      the Company's customer base and number of services offered.

      Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased $896,000 or
      3% to $27,088,000 due primarily to the increase in average earning assets
      of $80,776,000 or 14% to $643,847,000. This increase included an increase
      in total average loans of $33,782,000 or 8% to $477,234,000, an increase
      in average investments of $21,016,000 or 36% to $78,745,000 and an
      increase in average federal funds sold and other short-term investments of
      $25,978,000 or 42% to $87,868,000. The growth in average earning assets
      was derived from both increases in deposits and accounts and drafts
      payable. Interest income, derived from the increase in earning assets, was
      partially offset by an increase in interest paid on deposit liabilities,
      due to both an increase in balances and an increase in rates paid. Gains
      from the sale of securities decreased $409,000 compared to last year,
      $1,045,000 in 2004 and $1,454,000 in 2003.

      Revenue generated from the Company's software subsidiary declined
      $2,539,000 or 33% to $5,157,000 due primarily to a decrease in license
      fees generated from new customers as the market for governmental software
      appears to have softened from the previous year.

      Bank service fees decreased $87,000 or 5% to $1,719,000 due primarily to
      the fact that as the earnings credit rate granted customers on their
      account balances increases with the general level of interest rates, the
      amount of service fees charged decreases. Other income decreased $83,000
      or 12% to $588,000 due mainly to a decrease in revenue generated from the
      investment in bank owned life insurance during 2004. Operating expenses
      increased a modest $121,000 or less than 1% to $55,025,000 despite the
      additional expenses generated from the acquisition of PROFITLAB, Inc.

The results of 2003 compared to 2002 include the following significant items:

      Information services payment and processing revenue increased $3,818,000
      or 16% to $28,440,000 as the number of transactions processed increased
      2,993,000 or 12% to 27,977,000. This increase was driven by the expansion
      of the Company's customer base and number of services provided as well as
      an increase in national freight activity during the second half of the
      year.

      Net interest income after provision for loan losses decreased $2,652,000
      or 9% to $26,192,000 due to the dramatic decline in interest rates during
      the past few years. This decline occurred despite the fact that total
      average loans, typically the Company's highest-yielding asset for any
      given maturity, grew $39,359,000 or 10%


                                       7
<PAGE>

      to $443,452,000 and average earning assets grew $19,060,000 or 4% to
      $563,071,000. The growth in average earning assets was derived from both
      increases in deposits and accounts and drafts payable. Gains from the sale
      of securities were comparable to last year, $1,454,000 in 2003 and
      $1,477,000 in 2002.

      On January 1, 2003, the Company reclassified the foreclosed assets
      relating to its software subsidiary, GEMS, from held for sale to held and
      used and consolidated its operations into those of the Bank subsidiary. On
      January 2, 2001, the Company's bank subsidiary foreclosed on these
      operating assets in order to protect its financial interests. The Bank
      sold these assets to a wholly owned subsidiary, and invested in and
      stabilized this business. From the date of foreclosure through December
      31, 2002, these assets were accounted for as a foreclosed asset held for
      sale. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS 144"),
      "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", adopted
      by the Company on January 1, 2002, requires that if certain criteria are
      not met for long-lived asset (disposal) groups classified as held for sale
      by the end of the fiscal year in which SFAS 144 is initially applied, the
      related long-lived assets shall be reclassified as held and used. In 2003
      revenues for this segment were $7,696,000 and operating profits were
      $107,000.

      Bank service fees increased $147,000 or 9% to $1,806,000 due primarily to
      the fact that as the earnings credit rate granted customers on their
      account balances decreases with the general level of interest rates, the
      amount of service fees charged increases. Other income increased $399,000
      or 147% to $671,000 due mainly to an investment in bank owned life
      insurance during 2002. Operating expenses, excluding the effects of the
      GEMS consolidation, increased a modest $996,000 or 2% to $47,571,000 due
      mainly to increases in salaries and health and worker's compensation
      insurance expenses.

Fee Revenue and Other Income

The Company's fee revenue is derived mainly from freight and utility payment and
processing fees. As the Company provides its processing and payment services, it
is compensated by service fees which are typically calculated on a per-item
basis and by the accounts and drafts payable balances generated in the payment
process which can be used to generate interest income. Processing volumes
related to fees and accounts and drafts payable for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

Fee revenue and other income in 2004 compared to 2003 include the following
significant pre-tax components:

      Transaction volume from the Transportation Information Services increased
      slightly due mainly to increased activity from existing clients. There was
      also a change in mix from lower priced, simple transactions to higher
      priced, complex transactions. Total dollar volume processed from this
      division increased during this period due to increased activity from
      existing clients and larger average freight charges. Fees for the period
      grew due to the increased volume and additional services provided. The
      increase in volume and fees from the Utility Information Services division
      increased primarily due to new customers as the growth of this segment
      continues. The acquisition of PROFITLAB, Inc. contributed $538,000 of
      payment and processing fees for 2004.

      Software revenue decreased $2,539,000 or 33% to $5,157,000. This decrease
      was primarily due to the decrease in license fee revenue generated from
      new customer sales. Although revenue generated by GEMS increased in each
      of the past three years, sales were off significantly in 2004 as the
      market for governmental software appears to have decreased from the prior
      years.

      Bank service fees decreased $87,000 or 5% to $1,719,000. This decrease was
      due primarily to the fact that service fees decrease as the credit
      allowance for noninterest bearing deposits increases, due to the general
      level of interest rate increases.

      During 2004 the Company recorded net gains of $1,045,000 on the sales of
      securities with a fair value of $27,195,000. During 2003, net gains of
      $1,454,000 were recorded on the sales of securities with a fair value of
      $38,454,000. These sales of securities were made to adjust the portfolio
      to reflect the changes in the


                                       8
<PAGE>

      interest rate environment, growth in the loan portfolio during the past
      two years and to offset the loss of interest income due to the dramatic
      decline in the general level of interest rates.

      Other income decreased $83,000 or 12% to $588,000. This decrease was
      primarily due to a decrease in income recognized from the increase in the
      cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance purchased by the Company
      in 2002.

Fee revenue and other income in 2003 compared to 2002 include the following
significant pre-tax components:

      Information services payment and processing fee revenue increased
      $3,818,000 or 16% to $28,440,000. These increases both relate to new
      customers and new product offerings. Utility processing volume and
      revenue, which represents a newer market, had higher percentage increases.

      Software revenue in 2003 of $7,696,000 represents the revenue of the
      Bank's software subsidiary GEMS, which develops and licenses integrated
      financial, property and human resource management systems to the public
      sector. Prior to December 31, 2002, GEMS was accounted for as an asset
      held for sale and its operating results were not consolidated with those
      of the Company. SFAS 144, adopted by the company in 2002, now requires
      that GEMS be reclassified as an asset held and used. Consequently, Cass
      reclassified the entity's net assets and consolidated its operations with
      the parent company on January 1, 2003. Although unconsolidated in 2002 and
      2001, software revenue was $5,526,000 and $4,187,000, respectively.

      Bank service fees increased $147,000 or 9% to $1,806,000. This increase
      was due primarily to the fact that service fees increase as the credit
      allowance for noninterest bearing deposits decreases, due to the general
      level of interest rate decreases.

      During 2003 the Company recorded net gains of $1,454,000 on the sales of
      securities with a fair value of $38,454,000. During 2002, net gains of
      $1,477,000 were recorded on the sales of securities with a fair value of
      $63,945,000. These sales of securities were made to adjust the portfolio
      to reflect the changes in the interest rate environment, growth in the
      loan portfolio during the past two years and to offset the loss of
      interest income due to the dramatic decline in the general level of
      interest rates.

      Other income increased $399,000 or 147% to $671,000. This increase was
      primarily due to income recognized from the increase in the cash surrender
      value of bank owned life insurance purchased by the Company in 2002.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans,
investments, and other earning assets and interest expense on deposits and other
interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is a significant source of the
Company's revenues. The following table summarizes the changes in net interest
income and related factors for the three periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

Net interest income in 2004 compared to 2003:

      The increase in net interest income was caused by the significant increase
      in earning assets that exceeded the decline in net interest margin. This
      increase in earning assets was funded by both an increase in accounts and
      drafts payable due to the increased dollars processed and an increase in
      bank deposits due to the expansion of the Banks' customer base. The
      Company is negatively affected by decreases in the level of interest rates
      due to the fact that its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its
      rate sensitive liabilities. Conversely, the Company is positively affected
      by increases in the level of interest rates. This is primarily due to the
      noninterest-bearing liabilities generated by the Company in the form of
      accounts and drafts payable. Despite the slight increase in interest rates
      during the second half of 2004 the net interest margin was lower than in
      2003 due to the decreases over the past few years and the fact that
      changes in interest rates affect some earning assets such as federal funds
      sold and floating rate loans immediately and some earning


                                       9
<PAGE>

      assets, such as fixed rate loans and municipal bonds, over time. This
      decrease in net interest margin was also negatively impacted by an
      increase in rates paid on deposits. More information is contained in the
      tables below and in Item 7A of this report.

      Total average loans increased $33,782,000 or 8% to $477,234,000. This
      increase was attributable to new business relationships. Loans have a
      positive effect on interest income and the net interest margin due to the
      fact that loans are one of the Company's highest yielding earning assets
      for any given maturity.

      Total average investment in debt and equity securities increased
      $21,016,000 or 36% to $78,745,000 as the Company invested part of the
      increase in deposits and payables. Total average federal funds sold and
      other short-term investments increased $25,978,000 or 42% to $87,868,000.
      This increase was also funded by the increase in accounts and drafts
      payable and growth in bank deposits and provides the Company with
      additional liquidity to take advantage of higher interest rates.

      The increase in both interest-bearing liabilities and rates paid on
      deposits partially offsets the increases achieved by an increase in
      earning assets. Interest-bearing deposits increased $38,638,000 or 25.9%
      due to the Bank's marketing efforts to increase its customer base. Rates
      paid on the deposits increased 29.8% from 1.24% to 1.61%. This resulted in
      an increase of $1,177,000 or 63.7% in interest paid on deposits.

Net interest income in 2003 compared to 2002:

      The decrease in net interest income and margin was primarily due to the
      dramatic decrease in the general level of interest rates over the past few
      years. The prime rate decreased from 9.50% at the beginning of 2001 to
      4.00% at the end of 2003 and the 5-year Treasury note rate decreased from
      4.80% to 3.22% during this same period. The Company is negatively affected
      by decreases in the level of interest rates due to the fact that its rate
      sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive liabilities.
      Conversely, the Company is positively affected by increases in the level
      of interest rates. This is primarily due to the noninterest-bearing
      liabilities generated by the Company in the form of accounts and drafts
      payable. Changes in interest rates will affect some earning assets such as
      federal funds sold and floating rate loans immediately and some earning
      assets, such as fixed rate loans and municipal bonds, over time. More
      information is contained in the tables below and Item 7A of this report.

      The Company partially offset the decrease in net interest income through
      both an increase in earning assets and shift of earning assets to higher
      yielding asset classes. Total average earning assets increased $19,060,000
      or 4% to $563,071,000. This increase was funded by both an increase in
      accounts and drafts payable due to the increase in payments processed and
      an increase in bank deposits due to the expansion of the Banks' customer
      base.

      Total average loans increased $39,359,000 or 10% to $443,452,000. This
      increase was attributable to new business relationships and was funded by
      the increase in accounts and drafts payable, growth in bank deposits and
      reallocation of earning assets from the investment portfolio. Although not
      enough to offset the decline in the level of interest rates, this increase
      in loans had a positive effect on interest income and the net interest
      margin due to the fact that loans are one of the Company's highest
      yielding earning assets for any given maturity.

      Total average investment in debt and equity securities decreased
      $39,939,000 or 41% to $57,729,000. This decrease was used partially to
      fund the increase in loans and partially shifted into federal funds sold
      and overnight investments. Total average federal funds sold and other
      short-term investments increased $19,640,000 or 46% to $61,890,000.

2.    For purposes of these computations, nonaccrual loans are included in the
      average loan amounts outstanding. Interest on nonaccrual loans is recorded
      when received as discussed further in Item 8, Note 1 of this report.
3.    Interest income on loans includes net loan fees of $178,000, $90,000 and
      $441,000 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
4.    Interest income is presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a tax rate
      of 34%. The tax-equivalent adjustment was approximately $1,200,000,
      $928,000 and $1,122,000 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
5.    For purposes of these computations, yields on investment securities are
      computed as interest income divided by the average amortized cost of the
      investments.

(1) Loans have been classified as having "floating" interest rates if the rate
specified in the loan varies with the prime commercial rate of interest.

The Company has no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans, which
are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table and
discussed in Item 8, Note 5 of this report. As can be seen in the loan
composition table above and discussed in Item 8, Note 5, the Company's primary
market niche for banking services is privately-held businesses and churches and
church-related ministries.

Loans to commercial entities are generally secured by the business assets of the
company, including accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, and
the real estate from which the company operates. Operating lines of credit to
these companies generally are secured by accounts receivable and inventory, with
specific percentages of each determined on a customer by customer basis based on
various factors including the type of business. Intermediate term credit for
machinery and equipment is generally provided at some percentage of the value of
the equipment purchased, depending on the type of machinery or equipment
purchased by the entity. Loans secured exclusively by real estate to businesses
and churches are generally made with a maximum 80% loan to value ratio,
depending upon the Company's estimate of the resale value and ability of the
property to generate cash. The Company's loan policy requires an independent
appraisal for all loans over $250,000 secured by real estate. Company management
monitors the local economy in an attempt to determine whether it has had a
significant deteriorating effect on such real estate credits. When problems are
identified, appraised values are updated on a continual basis, either internally
or through an updated external appraisal.

Loan portfolio changes from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004:

      Total loans increased $31,416,000 or 7% to $500,448,000. This increase was
      due to both the expansion of church and church-related loans located
      throughout the country and commercial and construction loans in the St.
      Louis metropolitan area. At year-end, church and church-related real
      estate and construction credits totaled $173,379,000, which represents a
      7% increase over 2003. Additional details regarding the types and
      maturities of loans in the loan portfolio are contained in the tables
      above and in Item 8, Note 5.

Loan portfolio changes from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003:

      Total loans increased $34,343,000 or 8% to $469,032,000. This increase was
      due mainly to the expansion of church and church-related loans in the St.
      Louis metropolitan area and selected areas across the United States. At
      year-end, church and church-related real estate and construction credits
      totaled $162,307,000, which represented a 15% increase over 2002.
      Additional details regarding the types and maturities of the loan
      portfolio are contained in the tables above and in Item 8, Note 5.

Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses

The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $550,000 in 2004, $190,000
in 2003 and $500,000 in 2002. The amount of the provisions were derived from the
Company's quarterly analysis of the allowance for loan losses in relation to
probable losses in the loan portfolio. The larger provision made in 2004 was
primarily the result of the risks inherent in an expanding loan portfolio and
reserves made for specific problem loans. The larger provision made in 2002
partially resulted from risks inherent with the increase in average loans
outstanding and an increase in nonperforming loans. The amount of the provision
will fluctuate as determined by these quarterly analyses. The Company had net
loan charge-offs of $19,000 in 2004, net loan recoveries of $23,000 in 2003 and
net loan charge-offs of $113,000 in 2002. The allowance for loan losses was
$6,037,000 at December 31, 2004, compared to


                                       13
<PAGE>

$5,506,000 at December 31, 2003 and $5,293,000 at December 31, 2002. The
year-end 2004 allowance represented 1.21% of outstanding loans, compared to
1.17% at year-end 2004 and 1.22% at year-end 2002. From December 31, 2003 to
December 31, 2004 the level of nonperforming loans decreased $3,855,000 from
$4,393,000 to $538,000, which represents .11% of outstanding loans.
Nonperforming loans are more fully explained in the section entitled
"Nonperforming Assets".

The allowance for loan losses has been established and is maintained to absorb
probable losses in the loan portfolio. An ongoing assessment of risk of loss is
performed to determine if the current balance of the allowance is adequate to
cover probable losses in the portfolio. A charge or credit is made to expense to
cover any deficiency or reduce any excess. The current methodology employed to
determine the appropriate allowance consists of two components, specific and
general. The Company develops specific valuation allowances on commercial,
commercial real estate, and construction loans based on individual review of
these loans and our estimate of the borrower's ability to repay the loan given
the availability of collateral, other sources of cash flow and collection
options available to us. The general component relates to all other loans, which
are evaluated based on loan grade. The loan grade assigned to each loan is
typically evaluated on an annual basis, unless circumstances require interim
evaluation. The Company assigns a reserve amount consistent with each loan's
rating category. The reserve amount is based on derived loss experience over
prescribed periods. In addition to the amounts derived from the loan grades, a
portion is added to the general reserve to take into account other factors
including national and local economic conditions, downturns in specific
industries including loss in collateral value, trends in credit quality at the
Company and the banking industry, and trends in risk rating changes. As part of
their examination process, federal and state agencies review the Company's
methodology for maintaining the allowance for loan losses and the balance in the
account. These agencies may require the Company to increase the allowance for
loan losses based on their judgments and interpretations about information
available to them at the time of their examination.

Nonperforming Assets

It is the policy of the Company to continually monitor its loan portfolio and to
discontinue the accrual of interest on any loan on which payment of principal or
interest in a timely manner, in the normal course of business, is doubtful.
Subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to principal if there is
any doubt as to the collectibility of such principal; otherwise, these receipts
are recorded as interest income. Interest on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans,
which would have been recorded under the original terms of the loans, was
approximately $38,000 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Of this amount,
approximately $15,000 was actually recorded as interest income on such loans.

The total renegotiated loans of $168,000 at December 31, 2004 relates to one
borrower that is current under the new terms of the loan. Total nonaccrual
commercial loans consists primarily of one loan for $259,000 relating to a
business that is no longer operating, although payments are being made as the
inventory of the business is being sold and a specific reserve has been
established for the potential shortfall. Total nonaccrual real-estate mortgage
loans of $69,000 and the remaining balance of nonaccrual commercial loans of
$38,000 relate to one borrower. The collateral on these loans was sold during
the first quarter of 2005 and the remaining balance of $21,000 was charged-off
against the allowance for loan losses.

Total foreclosed assets of $375,000 at December 31, 2004 consisted of real
estate that was foreclosed on March 2, 2004 and was sold during the first
quarter of 2005 for a net gain of $38,000. The total foreclosed assets of
$859,000 at December 31, 2003 consisted of real estate property that was
foreclosed on August 8, 2001. This property was sold in the fourth quarter of
2004 and the Company recorded a net loss of $59,000. Foreclosed assets
classified as other real estate owned are recorded at what management estimates
to be fair value less cost to sell the property.

At December 31, 2004, approximately $5,008,000 of loans not included in the
table below were identified by management as having potential credit problems.
These loans are excluded from the table due to the fact they are current under
the original terms of the loans, however circumstances have raised doubts as to
the ability of the borrowers to comply with the current loan repayment terms.
Included in this balance is $3,805,000 related to one borrower that was
renegotiated in 2003 and although current under the new terms of the contract
management believes, due to the financial condition of the company, there still
remains risk as to the collectability of all amounts under the loan agreement.

The Company does not have any foreign loans. The Company's loan portfolio does
not include a significant amount of single family real estate mortgage or
installment credits, as the Company does not market its services to retail
customers.

The Company does not have any other interest-earning assets which would have
been included in nonaccrual, past due or restructured loans if such assets were
loans.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses in 2004 compared to 2003 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

      Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $1,046,000 or 3% to
      $38,198,000. Of this increase, $616,000 was related to the acquisition of
      PROFITLAB, Inc. The remaining increase primarily relates to annual salary
      increases and increases in pension and worker's compensation insurance
      expense.

      Occupancy expense increased $58,000 or 3% to $1,840,000. Of this increase
      $28,000 relates to the acquisition of PROFITLAB, Inc. and the remaining
      increase is primarily due to an increase in rent expense on leased office
      space. Equipment expense decreased $786,000 or 18% to $3,692,000. This
      decrease is primarily due to software that was capitalized in 2000 and
      2001 that is now fully amortized. Amortization of intangibles increased
      $57,000 or 18% to $368,000 due to the software acquired in the acquisition
      of PROFITLAB, Inc. Other operating expenses decreased $254,000 or 2% to
      $10,927,000. This decrease related to many factors including a decrease of
      $544,000 in postage and supply expense related to the increase in
      electronic processing in the Information Services Division and a decrease
      of $310,000 related to costs associated with the decline in software
      sales. These decreases were partially offset by expenses related to the
      acquisition of PROFITLAB, Inc. of $171,000 and an increase of $465,000 in
      outside service and professional fees, which includes fees of $225,000
      related to the additional procedures required under Section 404 of the
      Sarbanes-Oxley Act and an increase of $183,000 in outside imaging
      expenses. More details on the components of other operating expenses are
      contained in Item 8, Note 15 of this report.

Operating expenses in 2003 compared to 2002 include the following significant
pre-tax components:

      Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $5,747,000 or 18% to
      $37,152,000. Of this increase the consolidation of GEMS amounted to
      $4,139,000. The remaining increase primarily relates to annual salary
      increases and increases in health and worker's compensation insurance
      expense.

      Occupancy expense increased $282,000 or 19% to $1,782,000. Of this
      increase $237,000 relates to the consolidation of GEMS. Equipment expense
      increased $168,000 or 4% to $4,478,000. GEMS contributed $433,000 of
      equipment expense. Excluding GEMS, equipment expense decreased $265,000
      primarily due to decreases in computer equipment maintenance from the
      consolidation of equipment within the transportation processing division.
      Other operating expense increased $1,821,000 or 19% to $11,181,000. The
      consolidation of GEMS contributed $2,213,000 to other operating expense.
      More details on the components of other operating expenses are contained
      in Item 8, Note 15 of this report.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense in 2004 totaled $3,262,000 compared to $3,453,000 in 2003 and
$2,987,000 in 2002. When measured as a percent of income before income taxes,
the Company's effective tax rate was 29% in 2004, 30% in 2003 and 29% in 2002.
The primary reason for the lower effective tax rates in 2004 and 2002 was the
Company's investment in tax-exempt municipal bonds and income recognized on bank
owned life insurance.

Investment Portfolio

Investment portfolio changes from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004:

      U.S. Treasury securities increased $4,796,000 or 28% to $21,899,000. U.S.
      government corporation and agency securities increased $1,404,000 or 30%
      to $6,094,000. State and political subdivision securities increased
      $1,756,000 or 4% to $48,533,000. The investment portfolio provides the
      Company with a significant source of earnings, secondary source of
      liquidity, and mechanisms to manage the effects of changes in interest
      rates. Therefore, the size, asset allocation and maturity distribution of
      the investment portfolio will vary over time depending on management's
      assessment of current and future interest rates, changes in loan demand,
      changes in the Company's sources of funds and the economic outlook. During
      this period the size of the investment portfolio increased as the Company
      employed a portion of the increase in deposits and accounts and drafts
      payable. The minor changes in asset mix reflects the relative interest
      rates of the alternative investments and management's liquidity and
      interest rate forecasts at the time funds became available for investment.

Investment portfolio changes from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003:

      U.S. Treasury securities increased from $0 to $17,103,000. U.S. government
      corporation and agency securities decreased $22,557,000 or 83% to
      $4,690,000. State and political subdivision securities increased
      $5,854,000 or 14% to $46,777,000. During this period, the size of the
      investment portfolio remained fairly constant as the Company redeployed
      funds from maturing securities and security sales back into the investment
      portfolio. The increase in U.S. Treasury securities and decrease in U. S.
      government agencies and corporations reflect the relative yields of these
      securities at the time of investment.

There was no single issuer of securities in the investment portfolio at December
31, 2004, other than U.S. government corporations and agencies, for which the
aggregate amortized cost exceeded 10% of total shareholders' equity.

Equity Investments

During 2003, the Company converted a $2,000,000 investment in a private imaging
company from a convertible debenture into Common Stock. As part of the
conversion, the Company committed to investing an additional $1,100,000 when
certain conditions were met. This additional commitment has funded and the total
investment of the Company in this entity was $3,100,000 at December 31, 2004 and
$2,908,000 at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004 the Company had a 19.99%
ownership interest in this entity and the Chairman and CEO of the Company was a
member of the entity's Board of Directors. In addition, the Company has extended
a $2,400,000 line of credit for working capital purposes to this entity, with a
50% interest sold to a new non-affiliated majority owner. As of December 31,
2004 the Company's interest in this line amounted to $1,200,000 and all payments
are current.

This business has performed poorly during the past few years and the new
majority owner is currently in the process of stabilizing the business and
improving its financial performance. However, should this business fail to meet
its objectives, the Company's investment could be subject to future impairment.

The Company accounts for this investment, along with its other non-marketable
equity investments, under the cost method. Under the cost method of accounting,
investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary
declines in fair value, distributions of earnings and additional investments.
The Company periodically evaluates whether any declines in fair value of its
investments are other than temporary. In performing this evaluation, the Company
considers various factors including any decline in market price, where
available, the investee's financial condition, results of operations, operating
trends and other financial ratios.

Deposits and Accounts and Drafts Payable

Noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased $18,272,000 or 16% from December
31, 2003 to $96,362,000 at December 31, 2004. The average balances of these
deposits increased $3,790,000 or 4% from December 31, 2003 to $104,581,000 at
December 31, 2004. The decrease in ending balances relates to normal daily
fluctuations in these accounts.

Interest-bearing deposits increased $21,473,000 or 14% from December 31, 2003 to
$179,267,000 at December 31, 2004. The average balances of these deposits
increased $38,638,000 or 26% from 2003 to $187,798,000 in 2004. These increases
relate mainly to the Bank's increased marketing efforts to attract more
deposits.

Accounts and drafts payable generated by the Company in its payment processing
operations increased $58,484,000 or 20% from December 31, 2003 to $358,473,000
at December 31, 2004. The average balances of these funds increased $35,020,000
or 11% from 2003 to $341,247,000 in 2004. These increases relate to the increase
in dollars processed. Due to the Company's payment processing cycle, average
balances are much more indicative of the underlying activity than period-end
balances since point-in-time comparisons can be misleading if the comparison
dates fall on different days of the week.

The composition of average deposits and the average rates paid on those deposits
is represented in the table entitled "Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and
Stockholders' Equity; Interest Rate and Interest Differential" which is included
earlier in this discussion. The Company does not have any significant deposits
from foreign depositors.

Short-term Borrowings

Short-term borrowings increased $4,000 or 3% from December 31, 2003 to $127,000
at December 31, 2004. Average balances of these funds decreased $852,000 or 90%
from 2003 to $91,000 during 2004. These funds consist primarily of federal funds
purchased and can also include tax deposits of the U.S. Treasury. These balances
can vary significantly from day to day due to the Company's payment cycle and
therefore balances on any particular day are


                                       18
<PAGE>

not necessarily reflective of balances throughout the year. For more information
on borrowings please refer to Item 8, Note 10 of this report.

Subordinated Convertible Debentures

Total subordinated convertible debentures at December 31, 2004 were $3,700,000
and average balances of these funds were $1,314,000 for the year. The debentures
were issued on August 24, 2004 as part of the Company purchase of PROFITLAB,
Inc. The Company had no outstanding debentures in 2003. For more information on
these debentures please refer to Item 8, Note 11 of this report.

Liquidity

The discipline of liquidity management as practiced by the Company seeks to
ensure that funds are available to fulfill all payment obligations relating to
the freight and utility invoices processed as they become due, meet depositor
withdrawal requests and borrower credit demands while at the same time
maximizing profitability. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand
for funds with changes in the supply of funds. Primary liquidity to meet demand
is provided by short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash, maturing
securities and the ability to obtain funds from external sources. The Company's
Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO") has direct oversight responsibility for the
Company's liquidity position and profile. Management considers both on-balance
sheet and off-balance sheet items in its evaluation of liquidity.

The balances of liquid assets consists of cash and cash equivalents, which
include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and money market funds, and
were $87,543,000 at December 31, 2004, an increase of $25,176,000 or 40% from
December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004 these assets represented 12% of total
assets. These funds are the Company's and its subsidiaries' primary source of
liquidity to meet future expected and unexpected loan demand, depositor
withdrawals or reductions in accounts and drafts payable.

Secondary sources of liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing
lines. Total investment in debt and equity securities was $77,130,000 at
December 31, 2004, an increase of $7,983,000 or 12% from December 31, 2003.
These assets represented 11% of total assets at December 31, 2004. Of this
total, 63% were state and political subdivision securities, 28% were U.S.
Treasury securities, 8% were U.S. government agencies and 1% were other
securities. Of the total portfolio, 26% mature in one year, 24% matures in one
to five years, and 50% matures in five or more years. During the year the
Company sold securities with a market value of $27,195,000 and a portion of
these funds were reinvested in state and political subdivision securities and
the loan portfolio.

The Bank has unsecured lines at correspondent banks to purchase federal funds up
to a maximum of $29,000,000. Additionally, the Bank maintains lines of credit at
unaffiliated financial institutions in the maximum amount of $78,150,000
collateralized by U.S. Treasury and agency securities and commercial and
residential mortgage loans.

The deposits of the Company's banking subsidiary have historically been stable,
consisting of a sizable volume of core deposits related to customers that
utilize many other commercial products of the Bank. The accounts and drafts
payable generated by the Company has also historically been a stable source of
funds.

The Company also maintains a treasury stock buyback program pursuant to which
the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 100,000 shares of
the Company's Common Stock. The Company did not repurchase any shares during
2004 and repurchased 59,237 shares for $1,764,000 in 2003. As of December 31,
2004, 40,763 shares remained available for repurchase under the program.
Repurchases are made in the open market or through negotiated transactions from
time to time depending on market conditions.

Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the years 2004, 2003 and
2002 were $10,030,000, $10,181,000 and $8,978,000 respectively. Net income plus
the adjustment for depreciation and amortization accounts for most of the
operating cash provided. Net cash flows from investing and financing activities
fluctuate greatly as the Company actively manages its investment and loan
portfolios and customer activity influences changes in deposit and accounts and
drafts payable balances. Further analysis of the changes in these account
balances is discussed earlier in this report. Due to the daily fluctuations in
these account balances, the analysis of changes in average balances, also
discussed earlier in this report, can be more indicative of underlying activity
than the period-end balances used in the statements of cash flows. Management
anticipates that cash and cash equivalents, maturing investments and cash from
operations will continue to be sufficient to fund the Company's operations and
capital expenditures in 2005.

Capital Resources

One of management's primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital base to
warrant the confidence of customers, shareholders, and bank regulatory agencies.
A strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable growth
opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and creditors.
The Company and its banking subsidiary


                                       19
<PAGE>

continue to exceed all regulatory capital requirements, as evidenced by the
capital ratios at December 31, 2004 as shown in Item 8, Note 3 of this report.

In 2004, cash dividends paid were $.821 per share for a total of $3,025,000, a
7% increase over the prior year, which is attributable to an increase in the per
share amount paid and additional shares outstanding. On February 17, 2004 the
Company declared a 10% stock dividend payable to holders of record on March 5,
2004.

Shareholders' equity was $69,589,000, or 10% of total assets, at December 31,
2004, an increase of $4,797,000 over the balance at December 31, 2003. This
increase resulted from net income of $8,005,000, proceeds from the exercise of
stock options of $190,000 and other items of $210,000, which was partially
offset by cash dividends paid of $3,025,000, a decrease in other comprehensive
income of $579,000 and payment of $4,000 related to the stock dividend.

Dividends from the bank subsidiary are a significant source of funds for payment
of dividends by the Company to its shareholders. The only restrictions on
dividends are those dictated by regulatory capital requirements and prudent and
sound banking principles. As of December 31, 2004, unappropriated retained
earnings of $6,714,000 were available at the Bank for the declaration of
dividends to the Company without prior approval from regulatory authorities.

Commitments, Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, the Company is party to activities that
contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or
in part in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Such activities
include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments and
commitments under operating and capital leases. These financial instruments
include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit and standby
letters of credit. The Company's maximum potential exposure to credit loss in
the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for
commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit and standby letters
of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments. At
December 31, 2004, no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses for
these instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commercial
and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company
or its subsidiaries to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
These off-balance sheet financial instruments generally have fixed expiration
dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. At December
31, 2004 the balance of loan commitments, commercial and standby letters of
credit were $20,524,000, $6,097,000 and $1,091,000, respectively. Since some of
the financial instruments may expire without being drawn upon, the total amounts
do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commitments to extend
credit and letters of credit are subject to the same underwriting standards as
those financial instruments included on the consolidated balance sheets. The
Company evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The
amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of the credit,
is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held
varies, but is generally accounts receivable, inventory, residential or
income-producing commercial property or equipment. In the event of
nonperformance, the Company or its subsidiaries may obtain and liquidate the
collateral to recover amounts paid under its guarantees on these financial
instruments.

On August 24, 2004 the Company issued $3,700,000 in subordinated convertible
debentures as part of the Company's acquisition of PROFITLAB, Inc. Interest, at
a rate of 5.33%, is payable annually on the anniversary date of the acquisition.
The holders of the debentures can convert the principal amount into fully paid
and non-assessable shares of the Common Stock of the Company at a rate per share
of $48.20 at various amounts over a 10-year period, at which time the securities
mature. The debentures may be called by the Company without penalty after August
24, 2010. For more information on the acquisition please refer to Item 8, Notes
2 and 11 of this report.

related to operating and capital lease commitments and convertible subordinated
debentures at December 31, 2004:

During 2004, the Company contributed $1,083,000 to its noncontributory defined
benefit pension plan. The contribution had no significant effect on the
Company's overall liquidity. In determining pension expense, the Company makes
several assumptions, including the discount rate and long-term rate of return on
assets. These assumptions are determined at the beginning of the plan year based
on interest rate levels and financial market performance. For 2004 these
assumptions were as follows:

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Weighted average discount rate                             6.25%
        Rate of increase in compensation levels                    4.00%
        Expected long-term rate of return on assets                8.00%
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

Effect of Recent and Prospective Accounting Pronouncements

In 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on, "The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments" ("EITF 03-1"), which provides guidance to assess whether there have
been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security is
impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. Factors to consider include the
length of time the security has had a market value less than the cost basis, the
intent and ability of the company to hold the security for a period of time
sufficient for a recovery in value, recent events specific to the issuer or
industry and for debt securities, external credit rating and recent downgrades.
Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be
other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the write-down recorded
as a realized loss. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") announced that it will reconsider in its entirety all guidance on
disclosing, measuring and recognizing other-than-temporary impairments of debt
and equity securities. Until new guidance is issued, companies must continue to
comply with the disclosure requirements of EITF 03-1 and all relevant
measurement and recognition requirements in other accounting literature. The
disclosure requirements required under EITF 03-1 are included in Item 8, Note 4
of this report.

In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46R"), which addresses how a
business enterprise should evaluate whether it has controlling financial
interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly
should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaced, "Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,"
("FIN 46") issued in January 2003. Companies are required to apply FIN 46R to
variable interest entities ("VIEs") created after December 31, 2003. For
variable interest in VIEs created before January 1, 2004, FIN 46R will be
applied beginning on January 1, 2005. The Company is currently not a primary
beneficiary of a VIE and therefore the adoption of FIN 46R did not have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 132
(revised 2003), "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits" ("SFAS 132 (revised 2003)"), which increases the disclosure
requirements of the original statement by requiring more details about pension
plan assets, benefit obligations, cash flows, benefit costs and related
information and also requires companies to disclose various elements of pension
and postretirement benefit costs in interim-period financial statements for
quarters beginning after December 15, 2003. Additional disclosures pertaining to
benefit payments are required for fiscal years ending after June 30, 2004. The
disclosure requirements of SFAS 132 (revised 2003) are included in Item 8, Note
13 of this report.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment"
("SFAS 123R"), which replaced, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS
123") and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). SFAS 123R requires the measurement of all
employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in
our consolidated statements of income. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R
are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The pro forma
disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 will no longer will be an
alternative to financial statement recognition. See the section entitled "Stock
Options" of this Item 8, Note 1 for the pro forma net income and net income per
share amounts, for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004, as if we had used a
fair-value-based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to
measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. Although we
have not yet determined whether the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in amounts
that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123, we are
evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and do not expect the adoption to
have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and
net income per share.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Sensitivity

The Company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and its
fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest rates.
The asset/liability management discipline as applied by the Company seeks to
limit the volatility, to the extent possible, of both net interest income and
the fair market value of equity that can result from changes in market interest
rates. This is accomplished by limiting the maturities of fixed rate
investments, loans, and deposits; matching fixed rate assets and liabilities to
the extent possible; and optimizing the mix of fees and net interest income.
However, as discussed below, the Company's asset/liability position differs
significantly from most other bank holding companies with significant positive
cumulative "gaps" shown for each time horizon presented. This asset sensitive
position is caused primarily by the operations of the Company, which generates
large balances of accounts and drafts payable. These balances, which are
noninterest bearing, contribute to the Company's historical high net interest
margin but cause the Company to become susceptible to changes in interest rates,
with a decreasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods
of declining interest rates and an increasing net interest margin and fair
market value of equity in periods of rising interest rates.

The Company's ALCO measures the Company's interest rate risk sensitivity on a
quarterly basis to monitor and manage the variability of earnings and fair
market value of equity in various interest rate environments. The ALCO evaluates
the Company's risk position to determine whether the level of exposure is
significant enough to hedge a potential decline in earnings and value or whether
the Company can safely increase risk to enhance returns. The ALCO uses gap
reports, twelve-month net interest income simulations, and fair market value of
equity analyses as its main analytical tools to provide management with insight
into the Company's exposure to changing interest rates.

Management uses a gap report to review any significant mismatch between the
repricing points of the Company's rate sensitive assets and liabilities in
certain time horizons. A negative gap indicates that more liabilities reprice in
that particular time frame and, if rates rise, these liabilities will reprice
faster than the assets. A positive gap would indicate the opposite. Gap reports
can be misleading in that they capture only the repricing timing within the
balance sheet, and fail to capture other significant risks such as basis risk
and embedded options risk. Basis risk involves the potential for the spread
relationship between rates to change under different rate environments and
embedded options risk relates to the potential for the alteration of the level
and/or timing of cash flows given changes in rates.

Another measurement tool used by management is net interest income simulation,
which forecasts net interest income during the coming twelve months under
different interest rate scenarios in order to quantify potential changes in
short term accounting income. Management has set policy limits specifying
acceptable levels of interest rate risk given multiple simulated rate movements.
These simulations are more informative than gap reports because they are able to
capture more of the dynamics within the balance sheet, such as basis risk and
embedded options risk. A table containing simulation results as of December 31,
2004 from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates is shown
below.

While net interest income simulations do a good job of capturing interest rate
risk to short term earnings, they do not capture risk within the current balance
sheet beyond twelve months. The Company uses fair market value of equity
analyses to help identify longer-term risk that may reside on the current
balance sheet. The fair market value of equity is represented by the present
value of all future income streams generated by the current balance sheet. The
Company measures the fair market value of equity as the net present value of all
asset and liability cash flows discounted at forward rates suggested by the
current Treasury curve plus appropriate credit spreads. This representation of
the change in the fair market value of equity under different rate scenarios
gives insight into the magnitude of risk to future earnings due to rate changes.
Management has set policy limits relating to declines in the market value of
equity. The table below contains the analysis, which illustrates the effects of
an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates as of December 31,
2004:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Summary of Operations The Company provides payment and information services,
which include processing and payment of freight, utility and telecommunications
invoices. These services include the acquisition and management of data,
information delivery and financial exchange. The consolidated balance sheet
captions, "Accounts and drafts payable" and "Payments in excess of funding,"
consist of obligations related to the payment services that are performed for
customers. The Company also provides a full range of banking services to
individual, corporate and institutional customers through its wholly-owned bank
subsidiary and enterprise software solutions to governmental entities through
its software subsidiary.

Basis of Presentation The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and
its subsidiaries conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions.
Certain amounts in the 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. Such reclassifications have no
effect on previously reported net income or shareholders' equity.

Use of Estimates In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Company
management is required to make estimates and assumptions which significantly
affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. A
significant estimate, which is particularly susceptible to change in a short
period of time, is the determination of the allowance for loan losses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash
flows, the Company considers cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and
other short-term investments as segregated in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets to be cash equivalents.

Investment in Debt and Equity Securities The Company classifies its debt and
marketable equity securities as available-for-sale. Securities classified as
available-for-sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, net
of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders' equity. A
decline in the fair value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is
deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and the
establishment of a new cost basis for the security. To determine whether an
impairment is other than temporary, the Company considers whether it has the
ability and intent to hold the investment until a market place recovery and
considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable
outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment
includes the reasons for impairment, the severity and duration of the
impairment, changes in value subsequent to year-end and forecasted performance
of the investee. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest
income over the estimated lives of the securities. Interest income is recognized
when earned. Gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification
method. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair
values are stated at cost.

Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is increased by
provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge-offs. The provisions
charged to expense are based on economic conditions, past losses, collection
experience, risk characteristics of the portfolio and such other factors which,
in management's judgment, deserve current recognition.

Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses
in the loan portfolio. While management uses all available information to
recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary
based on changes in economic conditions. Additionally, various regulatory
agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review
the Company's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company
to increase the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and
interpretations about information available to them at the time of their
examination.

Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, or the respective lease terms for
leasehold improvements, using straight-line and accelerated methods. Estimated
useful lives do not exceed 40 years for buildings, the lesser of 10 years or the
life of the lease for leasehold improvements and range from 3 to 7 years for
software, equipment, furniture and fixtures. Maintenance and repairs are charged
to expense as incurred.

Intangible Assets Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and fair
value in excess of cost of net assets acquired have resulted from business
acquisitions which were accounted for using the purchase method. The


                                       28
<PAGE>

Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), which requires that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be
amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS 142 also
requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over
their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144. The disclosure requirements
of SFAS 142 are included in Item 8, Note 8 of this report.

Periodically, the Company reviews intangible assets for events or changes in
circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not
be recoverable. Based on those reviews, adjustments of recorded amounts have not
been required.

Non-marketable Equity Investments The Company accounts for non-marketable equity
investments, in which it holds less than a 20% ownership in, under the cost
method. Under the cost method of accounting, investments are carried at cost and
are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value, distributions
of earnings and additional investments. The Company periodically evaluates
whether any declines in fair value of its investments are other than temporary.
In performing this evaluation, the Company considers various factors including
any decline in market price, where available, the investee's financial
condition, results of operations, operating trends and other financial ratios.
Non-marketable equity investments are included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheets.

Foreclosed assets Other real estate, included in other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, is recorded at fair value less
estimated selling costs. If the fair value of other real estate declines
subsequent to foreclosure, the difference is recorded as a valuation allowance
through a charge to expense. Subsequent increases in fair value are recorded
through reversal of the valuation allowance. Expenses incurred in maintaining
the properties are charged to expense.

Treasury Stock Purchases of the Company's Common Stock are recorded at cost.
Upon reissuance, treasury stock is reduced based upon the average cost basis of
shares held.

Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in net
unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and minimum pension
liability adjustments and is presented in the accompanying consolidated
statements of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income.

Interest on Loans Interest on loans is recognized based upon the principal
amounts outstanding. It is the Company's policy to discontinue the accrual of
interest when there is reasonable doubt as to the collectibility of principal or
interest. Subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to principal if
there is any doubt as to the collectibility of such principal; otherwise, these
receipts are recorded as interest income. The accrual of interest on a loan is
resumed when the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest
and/or the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current.

Impairment of Loans A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a
creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due, both principal and interest,
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When measuring
impairment, the expected future cash flows of an impaired loan are discounted at
the loan's effective interest rate. Alternatively, impairment could be measured
by reference to an observable market price, if one exists, or the fair value of
the collateral for a collateral-dependent loan. Regardless of the historical
measurement method used, the Company measures impairment based on the fair value
of the collateral when the Company determines foreclosure is probable.
Additionally, impairment of a restructured loan is measured by discounting the
total expected future cash flows at the loan's effective rate of interest as
stated in the original loan agreement. The Company uses its nonaccrual methods
as discussed above for recognizing interest on impaired loans.

Information Services Revenue Revenue from freight, utility and telecommunication
payment related services is recognized when earned and fees are billed to
customers, generally monthly.

Software Revenue Software revenue consists of license fees, hardware sales,
maintenance fees and other service fees. License fees and hardware sales are
recognized in accordance with Statement of Financial Position ("SOP") 98-9,
"Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions" and therefore revenue is deferred until the following criteria are
met: (a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (b) delivery has
occurred, (c) the fee is fixed and determinable and (d) collection is probable.
Maintenance fees are normally paid in advance and cover a period of one year and
therefore fees are recognized ratably over the maintenance term and the
unamortized balance is carried as deferred income and included in other
liabilities. Other services are provided on an as needed basis and revenue is
recognized once the service has been completed and the customer is billed.


                                       29
<PAGE>

Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income, adjusted for the net income effect
of the interest expense on the outstanding convertible debentures, by the sum of
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and the
weighted-average number of potential common shares outstanding.

Stock Options The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the stock
option plan in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and accordingly the Company
recognizes no compensation expense as the price of the Company's employee stock
options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
The Company elected not to adopt the recognition provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," as amended by SFAS 148. An entity that continues to apply APB 25
shall disclose certain pro forma information as if the fair value-based
accounting method in SFAS 123 had been used to account for stock-based
compensation costs. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to
determine the fair value of the stock options at the date of grant. There were
10,130 options granted in 2004, 15,543 options granted in 2003 and 6,930 options
were granted in 2002. The required disclosure provisions of SFAS 123, as amended
by SFAS 148, are provided in the table below.

Recent and Prospective Accounting Pronouncements In 2003, the Emerging Issues
Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" ("EITF 03-1"), which
provides guidance to assess whether there have been any events or economic
circumstances to indicate that a security is impaired on an other-than-temporary
basis. Factors to consider include the length of time the security has had a
market value less than the cost basis, the intent and ability of the company to
hold the security for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value,
recent events specific to the issuer or industry and for debt securities,
external credit rating and recent downgrades. Securities on which there is an
unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to
fair value with the write-down recorded as a realized loss. In December 2004,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") announced that it will
reconsider in its entirety all guidance on disclosing, measuring and recognizing
other-than-temporary impairments of debt and equity securities. Until new
guidance is issued, companies must continue to comply with the disclosure
requirements of EITF 03-1 and all relevant measurement and recognition
requirements in other accounting literature. The disclosure requirements
required under EITF 03-1 are included in Note 4 of this report.

In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46R"), which addresses how a
business enterprise should evaluate whether it has controlling financial
interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly
should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaced, "Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,"
("FIN 46") issued in January 2003. Companies are required to apply FIN 46R to
variable interest entities (VIEs) created after December 31, 2003. For variable
interest in VIEs created before January 1, 2004, FIN 46R will be applied
beginning on January 1, 2005. The Company is currently not a primary beneficiary
of a VIE and therefore the adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on
its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 132
(revised 2003), "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits" ("SFAS 132 (revised 2003)"), which increases the disclosure
requirements of the original statement by requiring more details about pension
plan assets, benefit obligations, cash flows, benefit costs and related
information and also requires companies to disclose various elements of pension
and postretirement benefit costs in interim-period financial statements for
quarters beginning after December 15, 2003. Additional disclosures pertaining to
benefit payments are required for fiscal years ending after June 30, 2004. The
disclosure requirements of SFAS 132 (revised 2003) are included in Item 8, Note
13 of this report.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment"
("SFAS 123R"), which replaced, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS
123") and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). SFAS 123R requires the measurement of all
employee share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in
our consolidated statements of income. The accounting provisions of SFAS 123R
are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The pro forma
disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 will no longer will be an
alternative to financial statement recognition. See the section entitled "Stock
Options" of this note for the pro forma net income and net income per share
amounts, for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004, as if we had used a
fair-value-based method similar to the methods required under SFAS 123R to
measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards. Although we
have not yet determined whether the adoption of SFAS 123R will result in amounts
that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123, we are
evaluating the requirements under SFAS 123R and do not expect the adoption to
have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and
net income per share.

Acquisitions

On August 24, 2004 the Company acquired substantially all of the operating
assets of PROFITLAB, Inc., a provider of telecom auditing and application
services based in Greenville, South Carolina. Consideration for the acquisition
included cash in the amount of $1,098,000 and the issuance of $3,700,000 of
5.33% subordinated convertible debentures. The debentures are convertible, per a
schedule, into approximately 76,763 shares of the Company's Common Stock at a
price of $48.20 per share. The securities mature 10 years after the date of
issuance. The debentures may be called by the Company without penalty after
August 24, 2010. Total cost of the acquisition was approximately $4,977,000
which included $862,000 in acquired software, which is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 5 years and $4,039,000 in goodwill based on the
Company's purchase price allocation. All acquired intangible assets are
deductible for tax purposes.

On November 24, 2004 the Company acquired Franklin Bancorp, Orange, California
and merged its subsidiary bank, Franklin Bank of California into the Bank. The
purpose of the acquisition and merger is to establish a branch in California to
serve existing customers and prospects. Total cost of the acquisition was
$2,707,000 which included $171,000 of goodwill based on the Company's purchase
price allocation. The acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The above mentioned acquisitions of PROFITLAB, Inc. and Franklin Bancorp were
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements include the financial position and results of
operations for the periods subsequent to the respective acquisition dates, and
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated
fair value as of the acquisition dates. These fair value adjustments represent
current estimates and are subject to further adjustments as the valuation data,
including the receipt of certain third party valuation data, is finalized.

Note 3
Capital Requirements And Regulatory Restrictions

The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements
administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional
discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Under
capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital
guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain
off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The
Company and the Bank's capital amounts and classifications are also subject to
qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and
other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy
require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total
and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier I capital to average
assets. Management believes that as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company
and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective
action. As of December 31, 2004 the most recent notification from the regulatory
agencies categorized the Bank as well capitalized. To be categorized as well
capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier I risk-based,
and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no
conditions or events since that notification that management believes have
changed the Bank's category.

Subsidiary dividends are a significant source of funds for payment of dividends
by the Company to its shareholders. At December 31, 2004, unappropriated
retained earnings of $6,714,000 were available at the Bank for the declaration
of dividends to the Company without prior approval from regulatory authorities.
However, dividends paid by the Bank to the Company would be prohibited if the
effect thereof would cause the Bank's capital to be reduced below applicable
minimum capital requirements.

Restricted funds on deposit used to meet regulatory reserve requirements
amounted to approximately $766,000 and $663,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The Company and the Bank's actual and required capital amounts and ratios as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

There are 18 securities in an unrealized loss position included in the table
above and all have been in an unrealized loss position for less than one year.
All unrealized losses are reviewed to determine whether the losses are other
than temporary. Management believes that all unrealized losses are temporary
since they are market driven and the Company has the ability to hold these
securities until maturity.

The amortized cost and fair value of debt and equity securities at December 31,
2004, by contractual maturity, are shown in the following table. Expected
maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the

Equity Investments in Non-Marketable Securities

During 2003, the Company converted a $2,000,000 investment in a private imaging
company from a convertible debenture into Common Stock. As part of the
conversion, the Company committed to investing an additional $1,100,000 when
certain conditions were met. This additional commitment has funded and the total
investment of the Company in this entity was $3,100,000 at December 31, 2004 and
$2,908,000 at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004 the Company had a 19.99%
ownership interest in this entity and the Chairman and CEO of the Company was a
member of the entity's Board of Directors. In addition, the Company has extended
a $2,400,000 line of credit for working capital purposes to this entity, with a
50% interest sold to a new non-affiliated majority owner. As of December 31,
2004 the Company's interest in this line amounted to $1,200,000 and all payments
are current.

This business has performed poorly during the past few years and the new
majority owner is currently in the process of stabilizing the business and
improving its financial performance. However, should this business fail to meet
its objectives, the Company's investment could be subject to future impairment.

This investment, along with $519,000 of other investments in non-marketable
securities, is included in other assets on the Company's consolidated balance
sheets.

Short-Term Borrowings

Company short-term borrowings consist mainly of federal funds purchased and tax
deposits of the United States Treasury. At December 31, 2004 and 2003 the bank
subsidiary had short-term borrowings of $127,000 and $123,000, respectively that
consisted of borrowings from the Treasury related to tax deposits received from
customers not yet drawn upon by the Treasury. These borrowings are secured by
U.S. Treasury and agency securities. The average amount of all borrowings for
2004 was $91,000 at an average rate of 1.10% and the maximum amount outstanding
at the end of any month during the year was $131,000. The average amount of
borrowings for 2003 was $943,000 at an average rate of 1.48% and the maximum
amount outstanding at the end of any month during the year was $21,523,000.

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share
is computed by dividing net income, adjusted for the net income effect of the
interest expense on the outstanding convertible debentures, by the sum of the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted-average
number of potential common shares outstanding. The calculations of basic and
diluted earnings per share for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, which covers
most of its employees. The Company accrues and makes contributions designed to
fund normal service costs on a current basis using the projected unit credit
with service proration method to amortize prior service costs arising from
improvements in pension benefits and qualifying service prior to the
establishment of the plan over a period of approximately 30 years. Disclosure
information is based on a measurement date of December 31 of the corresponding
year.

A summary of the activity in the defined benefit pension plan's benefit
obligation, assets, funded status and amounts recognized in the Company's
consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003, is as follows:

The accumulated benefit obligation was $18,384,000 and $15,970,000 for the
periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company expects to
contribute approximately $1,265,000 to the plan in 2005.

The following pension benefit payments, which reflect expected future service,
as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

                        2005                       $   498,000

                        2010 - 2014                  5,367,000

The following represent the major assumptions used to determine the benefit

The investment objective for the defined benefit pension plan is to maximize
total return with a tolerance for average risk. Asset allocation strongly favors
fixed income investments, with a target allocation of approximately 67% fixed
income, 33% equities, and 0% cash. Due to volatility in the market, this target
allocation is not always desirable and asset allocations can fluctuate between
acceptable ranges. The fixed income component is invested in pooled investment
grade securities. The equity component is invested in pooled large cap stocks.

volatile sectors, although currently not employed, can be represented in the
asset mix to pursue higher returns with proper diversification. The assumed
long-term rate of return on assets is 8.0% as derived below:

                    Expected Long-Term                           Contribution to

================================================================================

The 8% assumption falls within the expected range.

In addition to the above funded benefit plan, the Company has an unfunded
supplemental executive retirement plan which covers key executives of the
Company. This is a noncontributory plan in which the Company's subsidiaries make
accruals designed to fund normal service costs on a current basis using the same
method and criteria as its defined benefit plan.

The pension cost for 2004, 2003 and 2002 for the supplemental executive
retirement plan was $110,000, $145,000 and $177,000 respectively, and included
the following components:

The accumulated benefit obligation was $1,891,000 and $1,605,000 for the periods
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Since this is an unfunded plan
there are no plan assets. Benefits paid on the plan were $9,000 in 2004 and no
benefits were paid in 2003 and 2002. Expected future benefits over the next 10
years are as follows:

                     2005                          $    34,000

                     2010 - 2014                     1,005,000

The major assumptions used to determine the projected benefit obligation and net
benefit cost are the same as those in the defined plan explained above.

The provisions of SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," required the
Company to record an additional minimum liability of $595,000 and $419,000 at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This liability represents the amount
by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair value of
plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded. The additional liability is
offset by an intangible asset to the extent of previously unrecognized prior
service cost. The intangible assets of $353,000 and $404,000 at December 31,
2004 and 2003,

respectively, are included in other intangible assets on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The remaining amount at December 31, 2004 of
$242,000 is recorded, net of tax, as an accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The Company maintains a noncontributory profit sharing plan, which covers most
of its employees. Employer contributions are calculated based upon formulas
which relate to current operating results and other factors. Profit sharing
expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income in 2004, 2003 and
2002 was $1,781,000, $1,755,000 and $1,632,000, respectively.

The Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan to provide additional
retirement benefits to substantially all employees. Contributions under the
401(k) plan for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $349,000, $333,000 and $277,000,
respectively.

Note 14
Stock Option and Bonus Plans

The Company maintains a restricted stock bonus plan which provides for the
issuance of up to 115,500 shares of Common Stock, the purpose of which is to
permit grants of shares, subject to restrictions, to key employees and
non-employee directors of the Company as a means of retaining and rewarding them
for long-term performance. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, 3,886 shares, 6,501
shares and 1,040 shares, respectively, were granted with weighted average per
share market prices of $32.91 in 2004, $24.74 in 2003 and $21.21 in 2002. The
fair value of such shares, which is based on the market price on the date of
grant, has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements through the
establishment of a contra shareholders' equity account which is amortized to
expense over the three-year vesting period. Amortization of the restricted stock
bonus awards totaled $96,000 for 2004, $57,000 for 2003 and $22,000 for 2002. At
December 31, 2004 the weighted-average grant date fair value and weighted
average contractual life for outstanding shares of restricted stock was $28.24
and .9 years, respectively.

A summary of restricted stock bonus share activity follows:

1.    As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $2 million of net
      operating loss carryforwards as a result of the acquisition of Franklin
      Bancorp. The utilization of the net operating loss carryforward is subject
      to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and limits the Company's use
      to approximately $120,000 per year during the carryforward period, which
      expires in 2019.

A valuation allowance would be provided on deferred tax assets when it is more
likely than not that some portion of the assets will not be realized. The
Company has not established a valuation allowance at December 31, 2004 or 2003,
due to management's belief that all criteria for recognition have been met,
including the existence of a history of taxes paid sufficient to support the
realization of deferred tax assets.

Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various pending legal actions
and proceedings in which claims for damages are asserted. Management, after
discussion with legal counsel, believes the ultimate resolution of these legal
actions and proceedings will not have a material effect upon the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Note 18
Disclosures About Financial Instruments

The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the
normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These
financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters
of credit and standby letters of credit. The Company's maximum potential
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the
financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of
credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts
of those instruments. At December 31, 2004, no amounts have been accrued for any
estimated losses for these instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commercial
and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These off-balance
sheet financial instruments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The approximate remaining
term of commercial and standby letters of credit range from less than 1 to 5
years. Since these financial instruments may expire without being drawn upon,
the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are subject to the same
underwriting standards as those financial instruments included on the
consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates each customer's
credit-worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if
deemed necessary upon extension of the credit, is based on management's credit
evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but is generally accounts
receivable, inventory, residential or income-producing commercial property or
equipment. In the event of nonperformance, the Company may obtain and liquidate
the collateral to recover amounts paid under its guarantees on these financial
instruments.

The following table shows conditional commitments to extend credit, standby
letters of credit and commercial letters at December 31, 2004 and 2003:

</TABLE>

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash and Other Short-term Instruments For cash and cash equivalents, accrued
interest receivable, accounts and drafts payable, short-term borrowings and
accrued interest payable, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair
value because of the demand nature or short maturities of these instruments.

Investment in Debt and Equity Securities Fair values are based on quoted market
prices or dealer quotes.

Loans The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows
using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with
similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings deposits and certain money
market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair
value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates
currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value
estimates above do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost
funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing
funds in the market nor the benefit derived from the customer relationship
inherent in existing deposits.

Subordinated Convertible Debentures The fair value of convertible subordinated
debentures is estimated by discounting the projected future cash flows using
estimated current rates for similar borrowings.

Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit The fair value of
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is estimated using
the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account
the remaining terms of the agreements, the likelihood of the counterparties
drawing on such financial instruments and the present credit-worthiness of such
counterparties. The Company believes such commitments have been made at terms
which are competitive in the markets in which it operates; however, no premium
or discount is offered thereon.

Limitations Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet
financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated
future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered
financial instruments. Other significant assets or liabilities that are not
considered financial assets or liabilities include premises and equipment and
the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit
liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market (core deposit
intangible). In addition, tax ramifications related to the realization of the
unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value
estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.

Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial
instruments, fair value estimates are based on management's judgments regarding
future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk
characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve


                                       44

uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be
determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the
estimates.

Industry Segment Information

The services provided by the Company are classified into three reportable
segments: Information Services, Banking Services and Government Software
Services. Each of these segments provides distinct services that are marketed
through different channels. They are managed separately due to their unique
service, processing and capital requirements.

The Information Services segment provides freight, utility and telecommunication
invoice processing and payment services to large corporations. The Banking
Services segment provides banking services primarily to privately-held
businesses and churches. The Government Software Services segment provides
integrated financial, property and human resource management systems to cities,
counties, and other public entities.

The Company's accounting policies for segments are the same as those described
in Note 1 of this report. Management evaluates segment performance based on net
income after allocations for corporate expenses and income taxes. Transactions
between segments are accounted for at what management believes to be market
value. Information for prior periods have been restated to reflect changes in
the composition of the Company's segments.

All revenue originates from and all long-lived assets are located within the
United States and no revenue from any customer of any segment exceeds 10% of the
Company's consolidated revenue.

Summarized information about the Company's operations in each industry segment
for the periods ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, is as follows:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cass Information Systems, Inc.:

      We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cass
Information Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2004
and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
shareholders' equity and comprehensive income for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2004. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

      We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

      In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cass
Information Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

      We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Cass
Information Systems, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission, and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion
on management's assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
over financial reporting.

NONE

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based
on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as
of the period covered by this annual report.

There have not been changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). All internal control systems, no matter how well
designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentations.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2004.

Our management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
follows.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Cass Information Systems, Inc.:

We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Cass Information
Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria
established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management's assessment that Cass Information Systems, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria
established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also, in our opinion, Cass
Information Systems, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Cass Information Systems, Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and shareholders' equity and
comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2004, and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
