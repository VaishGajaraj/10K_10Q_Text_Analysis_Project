                                     PART I

ITEM 1.   Business.

          Through internal development and by acquisitions, Air Products and
Chemicals, Inc. has established an internationally recognized industrial gas and
related industrial process equipment business and developed strong positions as
a producer of certain chemicals.

          The gases business segment recovers and distributes industrial gases
such as oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen, and a variety of medical and
specialty gases. The chemicals business segment produces and markets performance
materials and chemical intermediates. The equipment business segment supplies
cryogenic and other process equipment and related engineering services.

          Financial information concerning the Company's business segments
appears in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
8 herein, which information is incorporated herein by reference, as are all
other specific references herein to information appearing in such 2002 Financial
Review Section of the Annual Report.

          As used in this Report, the term "Air Products" or "Company" includes
subsidiaries and predecessors of the registrant or its subsidiaries, unless the
context indicates otherwise.

                                      GASES

          The principal industrial gases sold by the Company are oxygen,
nitrogen, argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air),
hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide (purchased, purified, or recovered
through the processing of natural gas or the by-product streams from process
plants), synthesis gas (combined streams of hydrogen and carbon monoxide), and
helium (purchased or refined from crude helium). Medical and specialty gases are
manufactured or blended by the Company or purchased for resale. The gases
segment also includes the Company's global healthcare, power generation, and
flue gas treatment businesses.

          The Company's gas business involves three principal modes of supply:

          "On-site/pipeline" supply--For large volume or "tonnage" users of
industrial gases, a plant is built adjacent to, on, or near the customer's
facility--hence the term "on-site". Alternatively, the gases are delivered
through a pipeline from nearby locations. Supply is generally made under long-
term contracts. In numerous areas--the Houston (Texas) Ship Channel including
the Port Arthur, Texas, area; "Silicon Valley", California; Los Angeles,
California; Phoenix, Arizona; Decatur, Alabama; Central Louisiana; Rotterdam,
the Netherlands; Korea; Singapore; Taiwan; Malaysia; and Brazil--Air Products'
hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, or nitrogen gas pipelines serve multiple
customers from one or more centrally located plants. Industrial gas companies in
which the Company has less than controlling interests have pipelines in
Thailand, Singapore, and South Africa.

          Liquid bulk supply--Smaller volumes of industrial gas products are
delivered to thousands of customers in liquid or gaseous form by tanker trucks
or tube trailers. These liquid bulk customers use equipment designed and
installed by Air Products to store the product near the point of use, normally
in liquid state, and vaporize the product into gaseous state for their use as
needed. Some customers are also supplied by small on-site generators using
noncryogenic technology based on adsorption and membrane technology which, in
certain circumstances, the Company sells to its customers. Liquid bulk
customers' contract terms normally are from three to five years.

          Packaged gases supply--Industrial and various specialty and medical
gases are also delivered in cylinders, dewars, and lecture bottle sizes. During
fiscal year 2002, the Company divested its historic U.S. packaged gas business
except for electronics gases and helium used in magnetic resonance imaging. The
Company is pursuing a similar divestiture in Canada.

          Oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen sold to liquid bulk customers
are usually recovered or generated at large "stand-alone" facilities located
near industrial areas or high-tech centers, or at small noncryogenic generators,
or are taken from on-site plants used primarily to supply tonnage users. On-site
plants are frequently designed to have more capacity than is required by their
principal customer to recover additional product that is liquefied for sale to a
liquid bulk market. Air Products also designs and builds

                                       1
<PAGE>
systems for recovering oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and low dew
point gases using adsorption technology.

          Sales of atmospheric gases--oxygen, nitrogen, and argon--constituted
approximately 26% of Air Products' consolidated sales in fiscal year 2002, 24%
in fiscal year 2001, and 25% in fiscal year 2000. Sales of industrial
gases--principally oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen--to the chemical process
industry and the electronics industry, the largest consuming industries, were
approximately 20% and 14%, respectively, of Air Products' consolidated sales in
fiscal year 2002.

          Other important consumers of Air Products' industrial and specialty
gases are the basic steel industry, the oil industry (which uses inert nitrogen
for oil well stimulation and field pressurization and hydrogen and oxygen for
refining), and the food industry (which uses liquid nitrogen for food freezing).
Air Products believes that it is the largest liquefier of hydrogen, which it
supplies to many customers, including the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration for its space shuttle program.

         The global healthcare business of Air Products is directed at two main
markets: institutional and homecare. The institutional market uses medical gases
in hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes, as well as helium for use in magnetic
resonance imaging. The homecare business was principally in Europe before the
acquisition in October 2002 of American Homecare Supply, LLC, which serves the
Eastern United States. Homecare involves the delivery of respiratory therapy
services, infusion services, and home medical equipment to patients in their
homes.

         Specialty gases include fluorine products, rare gases such as xenon,
krypton, and neon, and more common gases of high purity or gases that are
precisely blended as mixtures. Specialty chemicals for use by the electronics
industry include silane, arsine, silicon tetrafluoride, nitrogen trifluoride,
carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoromethane, and tungsten hexafluoride. These gases
and chemicals are used in numerous industries and in electronic and laboratory
applications. In certain circumstances the Company sells equipment related to
the use, handling, and storage of such specialty gases and specialty chemicals.

         Sales of industrial gases and sales of specialty products to the
electronics industry and others are made principally through regional offices in
the United States and other countries.

         Electricity and hydrocarbons, including natural gas as a feedstock for
producing certain gases, are important to Air Products' gas business. See "Raw
Materials and Energy". The Company's large truck fleet that delivers products to
liquid bulk customers requires a readily available supply of gasoline or diesel
fuel. Also, environmental and health laws and regulations will continue to
affect the Company's gas businesses. See "Environmental Controls".

         Air Products operates and has 50% interests in a 49-megawatt
fluidized-bed coal-fired power generation facility in Stockton, California and
in a 24-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle power generation facility near
Rotterdam, the Netherlands. A 112-megawatt gas-fueled power generation facility,
in which the Company has a 48.8% interest, operates in Thailand and supplies
electricity to a state-owned electricity generating authority and steam and
electricity to an Air Products industrial gases affiliate. Additional
information with respect to the Company's power generation and flue gas
treatment businesses is included in Notes 3, 8, and 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein.

                                    CHEMICALS

         The Company's chemicals businesses consist of performance materials
and chemical intermediates, where the Company is able to differentiate itself by
the performance of its products in the customer's application, the technical
service that the Company provides, and the scale of production and the
production technology employed by the Company.

Performance Materials

         The principal businesses of performance materials are Performance
Polymers, Performance Solutions, and Performance Products. Total sales from the
performance materials business constituted approximately 17% of Air Products'
consolidated sales in fiscal year 2002, 15% in fiscal year 2001, and 17%
(excluding PVOH) in fiscal year 2000. Air Products' performance materials are
differentiated from the competition based on their functionality when used in
the customer's products and applications, and by the technical service the
Company provides.



                                       2
<PAGE>
         Performance Polymers--Air Products' polymers are water-based and
water-soluble emulsion products derived primarily from vinyl acetate monomer.
The Company's major emulsions products are vinyl acetate homopolymer emulsions
and AIRFLEX(R) vinyl acetate-ethylene copolymer emulsions. The Company also
produces emulsions that incorporate vinyl chloride and various acrylates in
the polymer. These products are used in adhesives, nonwoven fabric binders,
paper coatings, paints, inks, and carpet backing binder formulations.

         Air Products owns 65% of a worldwide joint venture with Wacker-Chemie
GmbH that produces polymer emulsions and pressure-sensitive adhesives. The
Company also owns 20% of a worldwide joint venture with Wacker-Chemie GmbH that
produces redispersible powders made from polymer emulsions.

         Performance Solutions--These products are primarily acetylenic alcohols
and amines that are used as performance additives in coatings, lubricants,
electro-deposition processes, agricultural formulations, and corrosion
inhibitors.

         Performance Products--These products include polyurethane catalysts and
surfactants that are used as performance control additives and processing aids
in the production of both flexible and rigid polyurethane foam around the world.
The principal end markets for polyurethane foams include furniture cushioning,
insulation, carpet underlay, bedding, and automobile seating.

         These products also include epoxy additives such as: polyamides,
aromatic amines, cycloaliphatic amines, reactive diluents, and specialty epoxy
resins that are used as performance additives in epoxy formulations by epoxy
manufacturers worldwide. The end markets for epoxies are coatings, flooring,
adhesives, reinforced composites, and electrical laminates.

Chemical Intermediates

         The chemical intermediates businesses use the Company's proprietary
technology and scale of production to differentiate themselves from the
competition. The principal intermediates sold by the Company include amines and
polyurethane intermediates. The Company also produces certain industrial
chemicals (ammonia, methanol, and nitric acid) as raw materials for its
differentiated products. Total third-party sales from the chemical intermediates
businesses constituted 10% of Air Products' consolidated sales in fiscal year
2002, 10% in fiscal year 2001, and 12% in fiscal year 2000.

         Amines--The Company produces a broad range of amines using ammonia and
methanol, both of which are manufactured by Air Products, and other alcohol
feedstocks purchased from various suppliers. Other, more specialized amines, are
produced by the hydrogenation of purchased intermediates. Substantial quantities
of these products are sold under long-term contracts to a small number of
customers. These products are used by the Company's customers as raw materials
in the manufacture of herbicides, pesticides, water treatment chemicals, animal
nutrients, polyurethane coatings, rubber chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Ammonia
is produced as a feedstock for its alkylamines business, supplemented by
external purchases. Additional ammonia is purchased and converted to ammonium
nitrate prills and solutions that are primarily sold to customers as fertilizers
or for other chemical applications. Methanol is produced by Air Products as a
feedstock in methylamine production, and the excess over this requirement is
sold to a third party.

         Polyurethane Intermediates--The Company produces dinitrotoluene ("DNT")
and toluene diamine ("TDA") for use as intermediates by the Company's customers
in the manufacture of a major precursor of flexible polyurethane foam. The
principal end markets for flexible polyurethane foams include furniture
cushioning, carpet underlay, bedding, and seating in automobiles. Virtually all
of the Company's production of DNT and TDA is sold under long-term contracts to
a small number of customers.


                                      * * *


         Chemical sales are supported from various locations in the United
States, England, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, the Netherlands, Japan, China,
Singapore, and South Africa, and through sales representatives or distributors
in most industrialized countries. Dry products are delivered in railcars,
trucks, drums, bags, and cartons. Liquid products are delivered by barge, rail
tank cars, tank trailers, drums and pails, and, at one location, by pipeline.

         The chemicals business depends on adequate energy sources, including
natural gas as a feedstock for the production of certain products (see "Raw
Materials and Energy"), and will continue to be affected by various
environmental and health laws and regulations (see "Environmental Controls").

                                       3
<PAGE>
                                    EQUIPMENT

         The Company designs and manufactures equipment for cryogenic air
separation, gas processing, natural gas liquefaction, and hydrogen purification.
This segment also designs and builds cryogenic transportation containers for
liquid helium and hydrogen. Customers include companies involved in chemical and
petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, power
generation, and steel and primary metal productions. Air Products also designs
and builds systems for recovering hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, and low dew point gases using membrane technology. Additionally, a
broad range of plant design, engineering, procurement, and construction
management services is provided for the above areas. Equipment is manufactured
for use by the gases segment and for sale in industrial markets that include the
Company's international industrial gas joint ventures.

         The backlog of orders (including letters of intent) believed to be firm
from other companies and equity affiliates for equipment was approximately $114
million on 30 September 2002, approximately 13% of which relates to cryogenic
air separation, as compared with a total backlog of approximately $227 million
on 30 September 2001. It is expected that approximately $106 million of the
backlog on 30 September 2002, will be completed during fiscal year 2003.

                                     GENERAL


Foreign Operations

         Air Products, through subsidiaries and affiliates, conducts business in
numerous countries outside the United States. The structure of the Air Products
gas business in Europe is comparable to the Company's United States operation,
except in Europe, where the Company is still engaged in the packaged gas
business. Air Products' international business is subject to risks customarily
encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates and controls, import and export controls, and other economic,
political, and regulatory policies of local governments.

         The Company's industrial gas segment, through investments ranging from
wholly owned subsidiaries to minority ownership interests, does business in
approximately 35 countries outside the United States. Majority and wholly owned
industrial gas subsidiaries operate in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico,
and throughout Europe and Asia in 15 and ten countries, respectively. There are
50% industrial gas joint ventures in Canada and Trinidad and Tobago, seven
countries in Europe, five in Asia, and two in Africa, and less than controlling
interests in Africa, Canada, and Mexico, four countries in Europe, and three in
Asia. During the year, the Company acquired a controlling interest in the Taiwan
company, San Fu Gas Co. Ltd., bringing its interest to 70%. The Company also has
a 50% interest in a power generation facility in the Netherlands and a 48.8%
interest in one in Thailand.

         The principal geographic markets for the Company's chemical products
are North America, Europe, Asia, Brazil, and Mexico. Majority and wholly owned
subsidiaries operate in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom,
Australia, Singapore, Japan, Korea, China, and Mexico. The Company also has a
50% joint venture in the U.K that is developing products relating to silicon
wafer polishing, chemical mechanical planarization processes, and hard disk
polishing. The polymer emulsions and pressure-sensitive adhesives joint venture
with Wacker-Chemie GmbH has headquarters in the United States and production
facilities in the United States, Germany, Mexico, and Korea, along with a
technical service center in Shanghai, China. Headquarters for the 20% investment
in the redispersible powder venture with Wacker-Chemie GmbH are in Germany with
manufacturing facilities in Germany and the United States. The Company also has
less than controlling interests in Japan and Ireland that sell chemicals to the

United States Government.

         The Company's market-oriented approach to technology development
encompasses research and development and engineering, as well as commercial
development.

         The amount expended by the Company on research and development during
fiscal year 2002 was $121 million, $123 million in fiscal year 2001, and $124
million in fiscal year 2000. The amount expended by the Company on
customer-sponsored research activities during fiscal year 2002 was $18 million,
$19 million in fiscal year 2001, and $14 million in fiscal year 2000.

         In the gases and equipment segments, technology development is directed
primarily to developing new and improved processes and equipment for the
production and delivery of industrial gases and cryogenic fluids, developing new
products, and developing new and improved applications for industrial gases. It
is through such applications and improvements that the Company has become a
major supplier to the electronics and chemical process industries including
gases from air separation, specialty gases, and hydrogen. Additionally,
technology development for the equipment business is directed primarily to
reducing the capital and operating costs of its facilities and to
commercializing new technologies in gas production and separation.

         In the chemicals segment, technology development is primarily concerned
with new products and applications to strengthen and extend our present
positions in polymer and performance materials. In addition, a major continuing
effort supports the development of new and improved process and manufacturing
technology for chemical intermediates and polymers.

         A corporate research group supports the research efforts of the
Company's various businesses. This group includes the Company's Corporate
Science and Technology Center, which conducts research in areas important to the
long-term growth of the Company with focus on performance materials.

         As of 1 November 2002, Air Products owned 952 United States patents and
1,695 foreign patents. The Company is also licensed under certain patents owned
by others. While the patents and licenses are considered important, Air Products
does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any
particular patent or patent license, or group of patents or licenses.

Raw Materials and Energy

         The Company manufactures hydrogen, carbon monoxide, synthesis gas,
carbon dioxide, and methanol principally from natural gas. Such products
accounted for approximately 12% of the Company's consolidated sales in fiscal
year 2002. The Company's principal raw material purchases are chemical
intermediates produced by others from basic petrochemical feedstocks such as
olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons. These feedstocks are generally derived from
various crude oil fractions or from liquids extracted from natural gas. The
Company purchases its chemical intermediates from many sources and generally is
not dependent on one supplier. However, with respect to vinyl acetate monomer
that supports the polymer business, the Company is heavily dependent on a single
supplier under a long-term contract that produces vinyl acetate monomer from
several facilities. The Company characterizes the availability of these chemical
intermediates as generally being readily available. The Company uses such raw
materials in the production of emulsions, amines, polyurethane intermediates,
specialty additives, polyurethane additives, and epoxy additives. Such products
accounted for approximately 28% of the Company's consolidated sales in fiscal
year 2002. Natural gas is an energy source at a number of the Company's
facilities. The Company also purchases ammonia under long-term contracts as a
feedstock for several of its chemicals facilities.

         A long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of
dinitrotoluene (DNT), has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
since 8 May 2001. The Company's DNT operation in its polyurethane intermediates
business and supply to its customers have not been materially impacted. The
Company expects this supplier to be successful in its reorganization. If
reorganization is not successful, the sales and profitability of the chemicals
segment could be materially impacted on an annual basis due to the

                                       5
<PAGE>
supplier's shutdown and the Company's inability to supply all of its customers'
base requirements. The Company extended an $8.0 million line of credit to this
supplier, of which $7.5 million was drawn at 30 September 2002. The Company also
entered into a product prepayment agreement with this supplier. At 30 September
2002, the unamortized balance was $5.0 million. The Company expects to fully
recover these advances.

         The Company's industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of
electrical power. Electricity is the largest cost input for the production of
atmospheric gases. Any shortage of electrical power or interruption of its
supply or increase in its price that cannot be passed through to customers for
competitive reasons will adversely affect the liquid bulk gas business of the
Company.

         In addition, the Company purchases finished and semi-finished materials
and chemical intermediates from many suppliers. During fiscal year 2002, no
significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of
energy or raw materials.

Environmental Controls

         The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in
the United States and foreign countries where it has operations. Compliance with
these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs.
Additionally, from time to time, the Company is involved in proceedings under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (the
federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for
investigation and possible cleanup. Additional information with respect to these
proceedings is included under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, below. The Company's
accounting policies on environmental expenditures are discussed in Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein.

         The amounts charged to earnings on an after-tax basis related to
environmental matters totaled $24 million in 2002, $22 million in 2001, and $31
million in 2000. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance
with environmental laws, as well as remedial activities, and costs incurred to
meet internal Company standards. Such costs are estimated to be $25 million in
2003 and 2004.

         Although precise amounts are difficult to define, the Company estimates
that in fiscal year 2002 it spent approximately $14 million on capital projects
to control pollution versus $13 million in 2001. Capital expenditures to control
pollution in future years are estimated at approximately $19 million in 2003 and
$16 million in 2004.

         To the extent long-term contracts have been entered into for supply of
product, such as for the industrial gas on-site business and for certain
chemical products, the cost of any environmental compliance generally is
contractually passed through to the customer.

         It is the Company's policy to accrue environmental investigatory and
noncapital remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $9 million to a
reasonably possible upper exposure of $20 million. The balance sheet at 30
September 2002 includes an accrual of $15 million. At 30 September 2001, the
balance sheet accrual was $14 million.

         Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the
estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures.
Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company
does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental
matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a
materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations in
any one year.

Competition

         The Company's businesses face strong competition from others, some of
which are larger and have greater resources than Air Products.

         Air Products' industrial gas business competes in the United States
with three major sellers and with several regional sellers. Competition in
industrial gas markets is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and
furnishing or developing applications for use of such gases by customers, and in
some cases the provisions of other services or products such as power and steam
generation. Similar competitive situations exist in



                                       6
<PAGE>
European and Asian industrial gas markets in which the Company competes against
one or more larger entrenched competitors in most countries.

         Competition in the institutional market of the global healthcare
business is principally from other large, established industrial gas companies
using business models (long-term product supply agreements) that are similar to
those the companies utilize for other industrial gas supply relationships.
Competition in this market is principally based on price, quality, service, and
reliability of supply. Homecare is served by national and local providers, and
in the U.S. there are over 2,000 regional and local providers. It is highly
competitive. In the United States reimbursement levels are established by fee
schedules regulated by Medicare and Medicaid, or by the levels determined by
insurance companies. Accordingly, in the United States, homecare companies
compete primarily on the basis of service. Homecare companies generally direct
their marketing efforts towards referral sources that usually have no financial
responsibility for the payment of client services. Maintaining competitiveness
requires efficient logistics, reimbursement, and accounts receivable systems.
Although the Company intends to acquire additional homecare companies, there is
no guarantee that suitable candidates can be acquired or that the necessary
managed care contracts will be on favorable terms.

         The number of the Company's principal competitors in the chemicals
business varies from product to product, and it is not practical to identify
such competitors because of the broad range of the Company's chemical products
and the markets served, although the Company believes it has a leading or strong
market position in most of its chemical products. For amines the competition is
principally from other large chemical companies that also have the ability to
provide competitive pricing, reliability of supply, technical service
assistance, and quality products and services. The possibility of back
integration by large customers is the major competitive factor for the sale of
polyurethane additives. In its other chemical products, the Company competes
with a large number of chemical companies, some of which are larger, possess
greater financial resources, and are more vertically integrated than the
Company. Competition in these products is principally on the basis of price,
quality, product performance, reliability of product supply, and technical
service assistance.

         The Company's equipment business competes in all aspects with a great
number of firms, some of which have greater financial resources than Air
Products. Another important factor in certain export sales is financing provided
by governmental entities in the United States and the United Kingdom as compared
with financing offered by their counterparts in other countries. Competition is
based primarily on technological performance, service, technical know-how,
price, and performance guarantees. Air Products believes that its comprehensive
project development capability, operating experience, engineering and financing
capabilities, and construction management experience will enable it to compete
effectively.

Insurance

         The Company's policy is to obtain public liability and property
insurance coverage that is currently available at what management determines to
be a fair and reasonable price. The Company, for itself and its power generation
and flue gas treatment joint venture affiliates for which it assumes operating
responsibility, maintains public liability and property insurance coverage at
amounts that management believes are sufficient, after retention, to meet the
Company's anticipated needs in light of historical experience to cover future
litigation and claims. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will not
incur losses beyond the limits of, or outside the coverage of, its insurance.

Employees

         On 30 September 2002, the Company (including majority-owned
subsidiaries) had approximately 17,200 full-time employees, of whom
approximately 8,700 were located outside the United States. The Company has
collective bargaining agreements with unions at numerous locations that expire
on various dates over the next three to four years.  On 22 November 2002,
the agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers (I.A.M.A.W.) expired without ratification of a new agreement, although
employees continue to work. This collective bargaining arrangement covers
employees at the Company's Hometown, Pennsylvania facility, which produces
specialty gases and chemicals, and employees at two small equipment
manufacturing facilities. The Company considers relations with its employees to
be satisfactory. The Company does not believe that the impact of any expiring
or expired collective bargaining agreements will result in a material adverse
impact on the Company.

ITEM 2.    Properties.

         The principal executive offices of Air Products are located at its
headquarters in Trexlertown, near Allentown, Pennsylvania. Additional
administrative offices are located in owned facilities in Hersham, near London,
England; Brampton, near Toronto, Canada; and Hattingen, Germany. Administrative
offices are also located in leased facilities in the Allentown area,
Pennsylvania; Tokyo, Japan; Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China;
Singapore; Brussels, Belgium; Paris, France; Barcelona, Spain; and Sao Paulo,
Brazil. The management considers the Company's manufacturing facilities,
described in more detail below, to be adequate to support the business
efficiently. The following information with respect to properties is as of 30
September 2002.

Gases

         The gases segment has approximately 180 plant facilities in 39 states,
the majority of which recover nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. The Company has three
facilities that produce specialty gases and 30 facilities that produce and/or
recover hydrogen throughout the United States. Helium is recovered at two plants
in Kansas and Texas. There are 33 sales offices and/or cylinder distribution
centers located in 21 states. Global healthcare has approximately 200 facilities
in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and nine
countries in Europe.

         The property on which the above plants are located is owned by Air
Products at approximately one-fourth of the locations, and leased by Air
Products at the remaining locations. However, in virtually all cases, the plant
itself is owned and operated by Air Products. Air Products owns approximately
half of its industrial gas sales offices and cylinder distribution centers,
including related real estate, and leases the other half. The majority of the
facilities for global healthcare are leased.

         Air Products' European plant facilities total 61 and include three
plants that recover hydrogen, three plants that manufacture dissolved acetylene,
and three that recover carbon monoxide. The majority of European plants recover
nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. In addition, there are five specialty gas centers.
There are 119 sales offices and/or cylinder distribution centers in Europe, and
several additional facilities located in Brazil, Canada, Japan, the People's
Republic of China, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia,
and the Middle East. Representative offices are located in Taiwan and in Hong
Kong, Beijing, and Shanghai in the People's Republic of China.

Chemicals

         The chemicals segment manufactures amines, nitric acid, methanol,
anhydrous ammonia, and ammonia products at its Pace, Florida facility;
alkylamines at its St. Gabriel, Louisiana facility and its Camacari, Bahia,
Brazil facility; polyvinyl acetate emulsions at its South Brunswick, New Jersey
facility; styrene emulsions, styrene acrylics, polyvinyl acetate acrylics, and
polyvinyl acetate emulsions at its San Juan del Rio facility in Mexico;
polyvinyl acetate emulsions at its Cologne, Germany facility; nitric acid,
dinitrotoluene, and toluene diamine at its Pasadena, Texas facility; polyvinyl
acetate emulsions and acetylenic chemicals at its Calvert City, Kentucky
facility; specialty amines at its Wichita, Kansas facility; methylamines,
dimethyl formamide, choline chloride, and dimethyl amino ethanol at its
Teesside, England facility; and epoxy additives at its facilities in Manchester,
England, and Los Angeles, California. The chemicals segment manufactures
polyurethane additives and polyurethane specialty products
(AIRTHANE(R)/VERSATHANE(R)) at its Paulsboro, New Jersey facility that is leased
in part and owned in part. The chemicals segment also manufactures polyvinyl
acetate emulsions at four smaller locations.

         The chemicals segment has 13 plant facilities, one sales office, and
one laboratory in the United States, and operates three plants, four
sales/representative offices, and two laboratories in Europe, two laboratories
in Brazil and Japan, one laboratory in Korea and China, one plant in each of
Mexico, Korea, and Brazil, and sales offices in Australia, Brazil, Mexico,
Japan, Korea, and Singapore, and representative offices in Beijing, Shanghai,
and Hong Kong in the People's Republic of China. Substantially all of the
chemicals segment's plants and real estate are owned. The Company leases
approximately 75% of the offices and 25% are owned.




                                       10

Equipment

         The principal facilities utilized by the equipment segment include six
plants and two sales offices in the United States, two plants and one office in
Europe, one office in Japan, and one sales office in the People's Republic of
China. Air Products owns approximately 50% of the facilities and real estate in
this segment and leases the remaining 50%.

ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings.

         In the normal course of business Air Products and its subsidiaries are
involved in legal proceedings including proceedings involving governmental
authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act (the federal Superfund law); the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state environmental laws relating to the
designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there
are approximately 45 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached
where the Company, along with others, has been designated a Potentially
Responsible Party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise engaged
in investigation or remediation. Additionally, the Company has received several
notices between June 2001 and September 2002 of civil administrative penalties
from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection alleging various
exceedances and discrepancies relating to the air emissions from the thermal
oxidizer at the Company's Paulsboro, New Jersey chemical production facility.
While the aggregated, outstanding proposed penalties are $204,400, the Company
expects that the ultimate penalty amount to be incurred by it will be reduced.

         The Company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in
connection with these matters would have a materially adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, nor is there any material additional exposure
expected in any one year in excess of the amounts the Company currently has
accrued. Additional information on the Company's environmental exposure is
included under "Environmental Controls".

ITEM 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

         Not applicable.


                                    PART II

ITEM 5.  Market for Registrant's Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.

         The Company's Common Stock, ticker symbol "APD", is listed on the New
York and Pacific Stock Exchanges. Quarterly stock prices, as reported on the New
York Stock Exchange composite tape of transactions, and dividend information for
the last two fiscal years appear below. Cash dividends on Air Products' common
stock are paid quarterly. The Company's objective is to pay dividends consistent
with the reinvestment of earnings necessary for long-term growth. It is the
Company's expectation that comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in
the future.

ITEM 9.  Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and
         Financial Disclosure.

         On 10 May 2002, the Company terminated its engagement of Arthur
Andersen LLP of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ("Andersen") as independent auditors
and determined to appoint KPMG LLP as its new independent auditors for the
fiscal year ending 30 September 2002. This determination followed the Company's
decision to seek proposals from independent public accounting firms to audit the
Company's financial statements and was approved by the Board of Directors upon
the recommendation of the Audit Committee.

         Andersen's report on the Company's audited financial statements for
each of the years ended 30 September 2000 and 30 September 2001 did not contain
an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified
as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.

         During the years ended 30 September 2000 and 30 September 2001, and the
interim period between 30 September 2001 and 10 May 2002, there were no
disagreements between the Company and Andersen on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or
procedure which, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused
it to make reference to the subject matter in connection with its report on the
Company's financial statements for those years. Also, during those two years and
interim period, there were no reportable events as listed in Item 304(a)(1)(v)
of Regulation S-K.

         Air Products provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosure.
Andersen's letter dated 10 May 2002, stating its agreement with such statements,
was filed as Exhibit 16 to the Company's Form 8-K filed 10 May 2002, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

consult with KPMG regarding application of accounting principles to a specified

other matter or reportable event listed in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS ON SCHEDULE

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.:



          Under date of 28 October 2002, we reported on the consolidated balance
sheet of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and subsidiaries as of 30 September
2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
shareholders' equity for the year then ended as contained in the Annual Report
to Shareholders. These consolidated financial statements and our report thereon
are incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. In connection with our audit of
the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also audited the
related consolidated financial statement schedule referred to in Item 15(a)(2)
in this Form 10-K. This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this
financial statement schedule based on our audit.

          In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

          Our report contains an explanatory paragraph relating to the fact that
the financial statements of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of 30 September 2001 and for each of the years in the two-year period then ended
were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note
1 to the financial statements, those financial statements have been revised. We
audited the adjustments described in Note 1 that were applied to revise the 2001
and 2000 financial statements. In addition, as described in Note 10, the
financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets", which was adopted as of 1 October 2001. However, we
were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000
financial statements of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and subsidiaries other
than with respect to such adjustments and disclosures, and, accordingly, we do
not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000
financial statements taken as a whole.

Statements (File Nos. 33-2068, 33-65117, 333-21145, 333-45239, 333-71405,
333-18955, 333-73105, 333-54224, 333-81358, 333-56292, 333-21147, 333-60147,
333-95317, 333-31578, and 333-99497) on Form S-8 and in the Registration
Statements (333-02461 and 333-33851) on Form S-3 of Air Products and Chemicals,
Inc. and subsidiaries of our reports dated 28 October 2002, with respect to the
related consolidated balance sheet of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. as of
30 September 2002 and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows
and shareholders' equity for the year then ended, and the related financial
statement schedule, which reports appear in the 30 September 2002 annual report
on Form 10-K of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

          Our report contains an explanatory paragraph relating to the fact that
the financial statements of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of 30 September 2001 and for each of the years in the two-year period then ended
were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations.  As described in
Note 1 to the financial statements, those financial statements have been
revised. We audited the adjustments described in Note 1 that were applied to
revise the 2001 and 2000 financial statements. In addition, as described in
Note 10, the financial statements have been revised to include the transitional
disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", which was adopted as of 1 October 2001.
However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the
2001 and 2000 financial statements of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and
subsidiaries other than with respect to such adjustments and disclosures, and,
accordingly, we do not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on the
2001 and 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.

The following report is a copy of a previously issued Arthur Andersen LLP
("Andersen") report, and the report has not been reissued by Andersen. The
report of Andersen is included in this annual report on Form 10-K pursuant to
Rule 2-02(e) of Regulation S-X. After reasonable efforts the Company has not
been able to obtain a reissued report from Andersen. Andersen has not consented
to the inclusion of its report in this annual report on Form 10-K. Because
Andersen has not consented to the inclusion of its report in the annual report,
it may be difficult for shareholders to seek remedies against Andersen and
shareholders' ability to seek relief against Andersen may be impaired. See
Exhibit 23.1 for further discussion.


              REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS ON SCHEDULE


To: Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

          We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, the consolidated financial statements included in
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.'s Annual Report to Shareholders, incorporated
by reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated 26
October 2001. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
statements taken as a whole. The schedule referred to in Item 14(a)(2) in this
Form 10-K is the responsibility of the Company's management and is presented for
the purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and is not part of the basic consolidated financial statements. This schedule
has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
