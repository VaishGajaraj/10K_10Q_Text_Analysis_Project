     The aggregate  market values of the Class A voting common stock and Class C
non-voting   common  stock  held  by   non-affiliates  of  the  registrant  were
$19,584,820 and $251,453,353,  respectively,  as of the last business day of the
registrant's  most  recently  completed  second fiscal  quarter,  based upon the
closing prices for the  respective  classes on June 30, 2004 reported by the New
York Stock Exchange. For purposes of this information, the outstanding shares of
Class C non-voting common stock owned by directors and executive officers of the
registrant were deemed to be held by affiliates.  The aggregate  market value of
the Class B voting  common  stock is not  ascertainable  due to the  absence  of
publicly available quotations or prices for the Class B voting common stock as a
result of the limited  market for, and  infrequency of trades in, Class B voting
common  stock  and the fact  that  any  such  trades  are  privately  negotiated
transactions.


     As of March 1, 2005,  the registrant had  outstanding  1,030,780  shares of
Class A voting common stock,  500,301  shares of Class B voting common stock and
10,119,731 shares of Class C non-voting common stock.

                                     PART I
Item 1.  Business

General

     The  Federal  Agricultural   Mortgage  Corporation  ("Farmer  Mac"  or  the
"Corporation") was chartered by the U.S. Congress in the Agricultural Credit Act
of 1987 (12 U.S.C.  sections 2279aa et seq.),  which amended the Farm Credit Act
of 1971 (collectively, as amended, the "Act"). Farmer Mac is a stockholder-owned
instrumentality  of the United  States that was created to establish a secondary
market for  agricultural  real estate and rural  housing  mortgage  loans and to
increase  the  availability  of  long-term  credit at stable  interest  rates to
American farmers, ranchers and rural homeowners. The Farmer Mac secondary market
for agricultural mortgage loans accomplishes that mission by providing liquidity
and lending capacity to agricultural mortgage lenders by:

     o    purchasing  newly originated and  pre-existing  ("seasoned")  eligible
          mortgage loans directly from lenders;
     o    exchanging  newly  issued  agricultural   mortgage-backed   securities
          guaranteed  by Farmer Mac ("Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities")  for
          newly originated and seasoned  eligible mortgage loans that back those
          securities in "swap" transactions;
     o    issuing  long-term standby purchase  commitments  ("LTSPCs") for newly
          originated and seasoned eligible mortgage loans; and
     o    purchasing and guaranteeing  mortgage-backed bonds secured by eligible
          mortgage loans, which are referred to as AgVantage bonds.

     Farmer Mac conducts these activities through two programs--Farmer Mac I and
Farmer Mac II. Under the Farmer Mac I program, Farmer Mac:

     o    purchases eligible mortgage loans;
     o    securitizes  eligible  mortgage  loans  purchased and  guarantees  the
          timely   payment  of  principal  and  interest  on  the   agricultural
          mortgage-backed securities backed by such loans; and
     o    commits to purchase  eligible  mortgage  loans  under  LTSPCs for such
          loans.

To be  eligible  for the  Farmer Mac I program,  loans  must meet  Farmer  Mac's
underwriting,  appraisal,  documentation and other specified  standards that are
discussed in "Business--Farmer Mac Programs--Farmer Mac I."

     Under the  Farmer  Mac II  program,  Farmer Mac  purchases  the  guaranteed
portions of loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture (the
"USDA-guaranteed   portions")  pursuant  to  the  Consolidated  Farm  and  Rural
Development  Act (7  U.S.C.  sections  1921 et seq.) and  guarantees  securities
backed by those USDA-guaranteed portions purchased by Farmer Mac.

     Farmer Mac may retain Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities in its portfolio or
sell them to third parties.

     As of December  31,  2004,  outstanding  loans held by Farmer Mac and loans
that  either  back  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  or are subject to LTSPCs
totaled $5.5 billion. For more information about Farmer Mac's securities and its
financial  performance,  see "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations."

      Farmer Mac's two principal sources of revenue are:

     o    fees received in connection  with  outstanding  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
          Securities and LTSPCs; and
     o    net interest  income earned on its portfolio of Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
          Securities, mortgage loans, AgVantage bonds and investments.

     Farmer  Mac  funds  its  program   purchases   primarily  by  issuing  debt
obligations  of various  maturities.  As of December  31,  2004,  Farmer Mac had
outstanding  $1.8  billion of  discount  notes and $1.7  billion of  medium-term
notes. During 2004, the Corporation  continued its strategy of regularly issuing
debt to increase  its  presence  in the  capital  markets in order to reduce the
rates it pays on its debt,  which  allows  Farmer Mac to accept  lower  rates on
mortgages to farmers,  ranchers  and rural  homeowners  that it  purchases  from
lenders.  To the extent the proceeds of the debt  issuances  exceed Farmer Mac's
need to fund  program  assets,  those  proceeds  are  invested  in high  quality
non-program liquid assets.

     Farmer Mac is an institution of the Farm Credit System (the "FCS"),  but is
not  liable  for any debt or  obligation  of any other  institution  of the FCS.
Likewise,  neither the FCS nor any other  individual  institution  of the FCS is
liable for any debt or obligation of Farmer Mac.

     The Farm  Credit  Administration  ("FCA"),  acting  through  its  Office of
Secondary Market  Oversight,  has general  regulatory and enforcement  authority
over Farmer Mac,  including the authority to  promulgate  rules and  regulations
governing the  activities  of Farmer Mac and to apply FCA's general  enforcement
powers  to Farmer  Mac and its  activities.  For a  discussion  of Farmer  Mac's
statutory capital requirements and its capital levels, see "Business--Government
Regulation  of  Farmer  Mac--Regulation--Capital  Standards"  and  "Management's
Discussion    and   Analysis   of   Financial    Condition    and   Results   of
Operations--Balance   Sheet   Review--Capital"   and  "--Liquidity  and  Capital
Resources--Capital  Requirements."  For a  discussion  of two  pending  proposed
regulations  that would affect Farmer Mac if  promulgated in their current form,
see "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations--Regulatory Matters."

     Farmer Mac has three classes of common stock  outstanding--Class  A voting,
Class B voting and Class C  non-voting.  See  "Market  for  Registrant's  Common
Equity,  Related  Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities"
for information regarding Farmer Mac's common stock. Farmer Mac has one class of
preferred  stock  outstanding.  See  "--Farmer  Mac  Programs--Financing--Equity
Issuance" for information regarding Farmer Mac's preferred stock.

     As of December 31, 2004, Farmer Mac employed 38 persons,  located primarily
at its principal executive offices at 1133 Twenty-First Street, N.W., Suite 600,
Washington, D.C. 20036. Farmer Mac's main telephone number is (202) 872-7700.

     Farmer  Mac  makes  available  free of charge on its  Internet  website  at
www.farmermac.com  (in the  "Investors"  section)  copies of  materials it files
with,  or furnishes to, the U.S.  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC"),
including Annual Reports on Form 10-K,  Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q,  Current
Reports on Form 8-K, and  amendments  to those  reports,  as soon as  reasonably
practicable after electronically  filing such materials with, or furnishing such
materials to, the SEC. Please note that all references to  www.farmermac.com  in

                               FARMER MAC PROGRAMS

Farmer Mac I

      Loan Eligibility

     Under the  Farmer  Mac I  program,  Farmer  Mac  purchases,  or  commits to
purchase, eligible mortgage loans and guarantees the timely payment of principal
and interest on securities  backed by, or  representing  interests in,  eligible
mortgage loans. A loan is eligible for the Farmer Mac I program if it is:

     o    secured by a fee simple  mortgage or a long-term  leasehold  mortgage,
          with  status  as a first  lien on  agricultural  real  estate or rural
          housing (as defined below) located within the United States;
     o    an obligation of a citizen or national of the United States,  an alien
          lawfully  admitted for  permanent  residence in the United States or a
          private  corporation or  partnership  that is  majority-owned  by U.S.
          citizens, nationals or legal resident aliens;
     o    an obligation of a person,  corporation or partnership having training
          or  farming  experience  that is  sufficient  to  ensure a  reasonable
          likelihood that the loan will be repaid according to its terms; and
     o    in   conformance   with   Farmer   Mac's   underwriting,    appraisal,
          documentation  and  other  specified  standards  to  be  eligible  for
          participation  in the Farmer Mac I program.  See  "--Underwriting  and
          Appraisal  Standards"  and  "--Sellers"  for a  description  of  these
          standards.

     For purposes of the Farmer Mac I program,  agricultural  real estate is one
or more parcels of land, which may be improved by permanently  affixed buildings
or other structures, that:

     o    is used for the production of one or more agricultural  commodities or
          products; and
     o    consists  of a  minimum  of five  acres or  generates  minimum  annual
          receipts of $5,000.

For an eligible  agricultural  mortgage  loan  secured by 1,000 acres or less of
agricultural  real  estate,  the current  maximum  Farmer Mac I loan size set by
Farmer Mac is $23.8 million. For an eligible  agricultural mortgage loan secured
by more than 1,000 acres of agricultural  real estate,  the Act currently limits
the  maximum  Farmer  Mac I loan size to $5.0  million  (adjusted  annually  for
inflation).

     For  purposes  of the  Farmer  Mac I  program,  rural  housing is a one- to
four-family, owner-occupied,  moderately priced principal residence located in a
community  with a population of 2,500 or less.  Since November 2004, the maximum
purchase price or current appraised value for a dwelling,  excluding the land to
which the  dwelling  is  affixed,  that  secures a rural  housing  loan has been
$213,189,  as adjusted for  inflation.  In addition to the dwelling  itself,  an
eligible rural housing loan can be secured by land  associated with the dwelling
having an  appraised  value of no more than 50  percent  of the total  appraised
value of the  combined  property.  As of December 31,  2004,  loans  meeting the
eligibility   criteria   under  the  rural  housing   segment  of  Farmer  Mac's
requirements had not represented a significant part of Farmer Mac's business.

      Purchases

     Loan Purchases.  Farmer Mac offers credit products designed to increase the
secondary  market  liquidity  of  agricultural  mortgage  loans and the  lending
capacity of financial  institutions that originate  agricultural mortgage loans,
while permitting  Farmer Mac to efficiently  securitize  eligible mortgage loans
acquired  through  its  secondary  market  activities.  Farmer Mac  enters  into
mandatory and optional  delivery  commitments to purchase loans and offers rates
to price such commitments daily. Because the securitization process requires the
grouping of loans into uniform  pools,  Farmer Mac  emphasizes the importance of
conformity  to  its  program   requirements,   including   the  interest   rate,
amortization,  maturity and payment  frequency  specifications.  Farmer Mac also
purchases  portfolios  of newly  originated  and seasoned  loans on a negotiated
basis. Farmer Mac purchases fixed- and adjustable-rate loans primarily, but also
may purchase other types of loans,  including  convertible mortgage loans. Loans
purchased by Farmer Mac have a variety of maturities  and often include  balloon
payments.  Loans purchased or subject to purchase  commitments  also may include
provisions  that  require a yield  maintenance  payment  or some  other  form of
prepayment  penalty in the event a borrower  prepays a loan  (depending upon the
level of interest rates at the time of prepayment).

     During 2004, Farmer Mac purchased $104.4 million of loans in the Farmer Mac
I program.  Of the loans purchased  during 2004, 64.0 percent  included  balloon
payments and 8.0 percent included yield maintenance  prepayment  protection.  By
comparison,  during 2003, Farmer Mac purchased $192.6 million of loans under the
Farmer Mac I program.  Of the loans purchased during 2003, 74.0 percent included
balloon  payments  and  11.0  percent  included  yield  maintenance   prepayment
protection.  During 2004, Farmer Mac's top ten sellers generated 82.5 percent of
the total Farmer Mac I loan purchase volume, of which Zions First National Bank,
Farmer Mac's largest  combined  Class A and Class C  stockholder,  accounted for
33.0 percent.  The top ten sellers in 2003  generated  80.8 percent of the total
Farmer Mac I loan purchase volume,  of which Zions First National Bank accounted
for 38.7 percent. For more information  regarding loan volume, see "Management's
Discussion    and   Analysis   of   Financial    Condition    and   Results   of
Operations--Results of Operations--Business Volume."

     Mortgage-Backed Bond Purchases.  Farmer Mac purchases and guarantees timely
payment of  principal  and interest on  AgVantage  bonds issued by  institutions
approved by Farmer Mac. In approving such  institutions,  Farmer Mac assesses an
institution's  agricultural loan underwriting and servicing capabilities as well
as their creditworthiness for issuing AgVantage bonds to Farmer Mac.


     Each AgVantage bond is a general obligation of the issuing  institution and
is secured by eligible  collateral in an amount  ranging from 120 percent to 150
percent of the bond's outstanding principal amount. Eligible collateral consists
of loans that meet the same loan  eligibility  criteria applied by Farmer Mac in
its loan purchases and commitments and have an outstanding  aggregate  principal
balance equal to at least 100 percent of the bond's outstanding principal amount
plus cash or securities  issued by the U.S.  Treasury or guaranteed by an agency
or  instrumentality  of the United  States that make up any  remaining  required
collateral. During 2004, Farmer Mac purchased fourteen AgVantage bonds for $32.5
million  with  maturities  ranging  from  one  month  to  ten  years  from  four
institutions.  During 2003,  Farmer Mac purchased nine AgVantage bonds for $13.5
million  with  maturities  ranging  from  one  month to three  years  from  five
institutions. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the outstanding principal amount
of AgVantage  bonds was $24.3  million and $25.2  million,  respectively.  As of
December 31, 2004, Farmer Mac had experienced no losses,  nor had it been called
upon to make a guarantee payment, on any of its AgVantage bonds.

      Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Commitments

     Farmer Mac offers two  Farmer Mac I credit  enhancement  alternatives  that
allow  approved  agricultural  and rural  residential  mortgage  lenders both to
retain the cash flow  benefits of their loans and increase  their  liquidity and
lending  capacity.  Both of  these  alternatives  result  in  off-balance  sheet
transactions for Farmer Mac:

     o    a swap  transaction,  in which Farmer Mac acquires eligible loans from
          sellers in exchange  for Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  backed by
          those loans. As consideration for its assumption of the credit risk on
          loans  underlying  the Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,  Farmer Mac
          receives  guarantee  fees  payable in  arrears  out of  periodic  loan
          interest  payments and based on the outstanding  balance of the Farmer
          Mac Guaranteed Securities; and
     o    an  LTSPC,  which is not a  guarantee  of loans or  securities,  but a
          Farmer Mac  commitment  to purchase  loans from a  segregated  pool of
          loans on one or more  undetermined  future dates. As consideration for
          its assumption of the credit risk on loans underlying an LTSPC, Farmer
          Mac receives  commitment fees payable monthly in arrears, in an amount
          approximating   what  would  have  been  the  guarantee  fees  if  the
          transaction were structured as a swap transaction.

     A swap transaction or an LTSPC may involve loans with payment, maturity and
interest rate  characteristics  that differ from Farmer Mac's  standard  product
offerings.  Both  types of  transactions  permit a seller to  nominate  from its
portfolio  a  segregated  pool of loans,  subject  to  review by Farmer  Mac for
conformance with its underwriting,  appraisal and documentation standards.  Upon
Farmer Mac's acceptance of the eligible loans,  whether under a swap transaction
or an LTSPC, the seller effectively  transfers the credit risk on those loans to
Farmer  Mac,  thereby  reducing  the  seller's  credit  and  concentration  risk
exposures  and,  consequently,  its  regulatory  capital  and its  loss  reserve
requirements.  Only the  LTSPC  structure  permits  the  seller  to  retain  the
segregated  loan pool in its  portfolio  until such time, if ever, as the seller
delivers some or all of the  segregated  loans to Farmer Mac for purchase  under
the LTSPC.  An LTSPC commits  Farmer Mac to a future  purchase of loans that met
Farmer Mac's  underwriting  standards at the time the loans first became subject
to the LTSPC and Farmer Mac assumed the credit risk on loans.

      Farmer Mac generally purchases loans subject to an LTSPC at:

     o    par  plus   accrued   interest   (if  the  loans  become  four  months
          delinquent);
     o    a  mark-to-market  price or in  exchange  for Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed
          Securities (if the loans are not  delinquent  and are standard  Farmer
          Mac loan products); or
     o    either a mark-to-market  negotiated price for all (but not some) loans
          in the pool,  based on the sale of Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities
          in the capital  markets or the funding  obtained by Farmer Mac through
          the  issuance of matching  debt in the capital markets, or in exchange
          for  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  (if the loans are not four
          months delinquent).

     In 2004,  Farmer Mac  entered  into $392.6  million of LTSPCs,  compared to
$763.3  million in 2003.  Notwithstanding  the  significant  decline in business
volume during 2004 (described  further at "Management's  Discussion and Analysis
of    Financial    Condition    and    Results   of    Operations--Results    of
Operations--Business  Volume"), LTSPCs remained the preferred credit enhancement
alternative for new non-cash  transactions and were a significant portion of the
Farmer Mac I program.  As of December 31, 2004, Farmer Mac's outstanding  LTSPCs
covered  11,909  mortgage  loans  with an  aggregate  principal  balance of $2.3
billion.  As of December 31, 2004,  outstanding  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  were backed by 1,680  mortgage loans having an aggregate
principal balance of $882.3 million.  For more information  regarding  guarantee
and LTSPC  volume,  see  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations--Business Volume."

      Underwriting and Appraisal Standards

     Farmer  Mac  has  established  underwriting  and  appraisal  standards  for
agricultural  mortgage  loans to manage its credit risk, to mitigate the risk of
loss from borrower  defaults and to provide guidance  concerning the management,
administration  and conduct of underwriting and appraisals to all  participating
sellers and potential sellers in its programs. These standards were developed on
the basis of industry norms for agricultural  mortgage loans and are designed to
assess  the  creditworthiness  of the  borrower,  as  well as the  value  of the
mortgaged  property  relative  to the amount of the  mortgage  loan.  Farmer Mac
requires  sellers of  agricultural  mortgage loans to make  representations  and
warranties  regarding  the  conformity  of  eligible  mortgage  loans  to  these
standards and any other requirements it may impose from time to time.


     Farmer Mac I credit  underwriting  standards require that the loan-to-value
ratio ("LTV") of any loan not exceed 70 percent, except that a loan secured by a
livestock  facility and supported by a contract  with an integrator  may have an
LTV of up to 75 percent,  a part-time  farm loan  supported by private  mortgage
insurance may have an LTV of up to 85 percent and a rural housing loan supported
by private  mortgage  insurance may have an LTV of up to 97 percent.  Farmer Mac
also has a loan product for  borrowers  with high credit  scores whose loans are
secured by collateral  with low LTVs. For those  borrowers,  loan processing has
been simplified and  documentation  of the credit ratios  described below is not
necessary.  Farmer  Mac may  require  that a loan  have a  lower  LTV  when  the
Corporation determines that such lower LTV is appropriate.

     In the  case  of  newly  originated  loans  that  are not  part-time  farm,
facility, low-documentation or rural housing loans, borrowers on the loans must,
among other criteria set forth in Farmer Mac's underwriting standards,  meet the
following standard underwriting ratios on a pro forma basis (i.e., giving effect
to the new loan):

     o    debt-to-asset ratio of 50 percent or less;
     o    cash flow debt service coverage ratio on the mortgaged property of not
          less than 1:1;
     o    total debt service coverage ratio, including farm and non-farm income,
          of not less than 1.25:1; and
     o    ratio of current assets to current liabilities of not less than 1:1.

     Farmer Mac's underwriting standards provide for acceptance of loans that do
not conform to one or more of the standard  underwriting ratios, other than LTV,
when those loans:

     o    exceed  minimum  requirements  for  one or  more  of the  underwriting
          standards to a degree that compensates for  noncompliance  with one or
          more other standards, referred to as compensating strengths; and
     o    are  made to  producers  of  particular  agricultural  commodities  or
          products  in a  segment  of  agriculture  in which  such  compensating
          strengths are typical of the financial condition of sound borrowers in
          that segment.

     Farmer  Mac's use of  compensating  strengths  is not intended to provide a
basis for waiving or lessening  the  requirement  that eligible  mortgage  loans
under the Farmer Mac I program be of consistently  high quality.  In fact, loans
approved  on the  basis  of  compensating  strengths  have  not  demonstrated  a
significantly different rate of default than that of loans that were approved on
the basis of conformance  with all of the standard  underwriting  ratios.  As of
December 31, 2004, a total of $1.4  billion  (30.2  percent) of the  outstanding
balance of loans held and loans  underlying  LTSPCs and Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities  issued after the  enactment of the Farm Credit  System Reform Act of
1996 (the "1996 Act") were  approved  based upon  compensating  strengths  ($8.6
million of which had original LTVs of greater than 70 percent). The original LTV
of a loan is calculated by dividing the loan's principal  balance at the time of
guarantee,  purchase or commitment  by the  appraised  value at the date of loan
origination  or,  when  available,  updated  appraised  value  at  the  time  of
guarantee,  purchase or commitment.  During 2004, $169.3 million (34 percent) of
the loans purchased or added under LTSPCs were approved based upon  compensating
strengths ($1.5 million of which had original LTVs of greater than 70 percent).

     In the case of a seasoned loan, Farmer Mac considers sustained  performance
to be a reliable  alternative  indicator of a borrower's ability to pay the loan
according to its terms.  A seasoned  loan  generally  will be deemed an eligible
loan if:

     o    it has been  outstanding  for at least five years and has an LTV of 60
          percent or less;
     o    there  have been no  payments  more than 30 days past due  during  the
          previous three years; and
     o    there have been no material restructurings or modifications for credit
          reasons during the previous five years.

     A seasoned loan that has been  outstanding  for more than one year but less
than five years must  substantially  comply with the underwriting  standards for
newly originated loans as of the date the loan was originated by the lender. The
loan must also have a payment  history  that shows no payment  more than 30 days
past due during the three-year period  immediately prior to the date the loan is
either  purchased  by  Farmer  Mac or made  subject  to an  LTSPC.  As with  the
secondary  market for residential  mortgages,  there is no requirement that each
loan's compliance with the underwriting  standards be re-evaluated  after Farmer
Mac accepts the loan into its program.

     In the case of rural  housing and  part-time  farm loans,  the borrower may
finance up to 97 percent and 85 percent, respectively, of the appraised value of
the  property  if the amount  above 80  percent  is covered by private  mortgage
insurance. For newly originated part-time farm loans, the borrower must generate
sufficient income from all sources to repay all creditors. A borrower's capacity
to repay debt obligations is determined by two tests:

     o    the borrower's monthly mortgage  payment-to-income  ratio should be 28
          percent or less; and
     o    the  borrower's  monthly  debt  payment-to-income  ratio  should be 36
          percent or less.

     As Farmer Mac  develops  new loan  products,  it  establishes  underwriting
guidelines  for them.  Those  guidelines  result in  industry-specific  measures
equivalent  to the basic  underwriting  standards  and  provide  Farmer  Mac the
flexibility to deliver the benefits of a secondary  market to farmers,  ranchers
and rural homeowners in diverse sectors of the agricultural economy.

     The due  diligence  Farmer Mac  performs  before  purchasing,  guaranteeing
securities backed by, or committing to purchase seasoned loans includes:

     o    evaluation of loan database information to determine conformity to the
          criteria set forth in the preceding paragraphs;
     o    confirmation that loan file data conform to database information;
     o    validation of supporting credit information in the loan files; and
     o    review of loan documentation and collateral appraisals.


All of the foregoing are performed  through  methods that give due regard to the
size, age, leverage and nature of the collateral for the loans.

     Farmer Mac's appraisal standards for newly originated loans require,  among
other things,  that the  appraisal  function be performed  independently  of the
credit  decision-making   process  and  conform  to  the  Uniform  Standards  of
Professional  Appraisal Practice  promulgated by the Appraisal  Standards Board.
Farmer Mac's appraisal  standards require the appraisal function to be conducted
or administered by an individual  meeting specific  qualification and competence
criteria and who:

     o    is not  associated,  except by the engagement for the appraisal,  with
          the credit  underwriters  making the loan  decision,  though  both the
          appraiser  and the credit  underwriter  may be directly or  indirectly
          employed by a common employer;
     o    receives no financial or professional benefit of any kind by virtue of
          the report content,  valuation or credit decision made or based on the
          appraisal product; and
     o    has no present or contemplated  future direct or indirect  interest in
          the appraised property.

The appraisal  standards also require uniform reporting of reliable and credible
opinions   of  the  market   value,   market  rent  and   property   net  income
characteristics of the mortgaged property and the relative market forces.

     Farmer Mac requires  current  appraisals  in  conformance  with the Uniform
Standards  of  Professional   Appraisal  Practice  for  newly  originated  loans
purchased  or placed  under a Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Security  or LTSPC.  For
seasoned loans, Farmer Mac obtains appraisal updates as considered  necessary by
its assessment of collateral risk determined in the due diligence process.

     Farmer Mac personnel include experienced  agricultural credit underwriters,
appraisers and servicers who perform those  functions with respect to many loans
that come into the Farmer Mac I program.  In addition,  those personnel  oversee
the activities of several  servicing  centers to which Farmer Mac outsources the
remainder  of its  underwriting  function in order to access the  expertise  and
specialized  knowledge  of  several   industry-recognized   third-party  service
providers throughout the country.  The outsourcing  agreements afford Farmer Mac
the benefits of those servicing centers at fees based upon marginal costs, which
allows  Farmer Mac to avoid the fixed  costs  associated  with such  operations.
Farmer Mac supervises and monitors the performance of the outsourced  functions.
Farmer Mac believes  that the combined  expertise of those  third-party  service
providers and its own internal  staff  provides the  Corporation  with access to
adequate  resources for  performing  the necessary  underwriting,  appraisal and
servicing functions.


      Sellers

     As of December 31, 2004, there were 157 approved loan sellers in the Farmer
Mac I program, of which 59 were active participants in the program. The approved
sellers  range  from  single-office  to  multi-branch   institutions,   spanning
community banks, FCS  associations,  mortgage  companies,  large multi-state FCS
banks,  commercial banks and insurance companies. As of December 31, 2003, there
were 142 approved  sellers in the Farmer Mac I program,  of which 81 were active
participants in the program. In addition to participating directly in the Farmer
Mac I  program,  some of the  approved  loan  sellers  enable  other  lenders to
participate  indirectly  in the Farmer Mac I program by  managing  correspondent
networks of lenders from which they purchase  loans to sell to Farmer Mac. As of
December 31, 2004,  more than 75 lenders were  participating  in those networks,
bringing the total Farmer Mac I program participants to more than 230 as of that
date.


     To be  considered  for  approval  as a Farmer  Mac I  seller,  a  financial
institution must meet the criteria that Farmer Mac establishes, including:

     o    owning a  requisite  amount  of  Farmer  Mac Class A or Class B voting
          common stock according to a schedule  prescribed for the size and type
          of institution;
     o    having,  in the judgment of Farmer Mac, the ability and  experience to
          make or purchase and sell agricultural mortgage loans of the type that
          will  qualify for  purchase by Farmer Mac and  service  such  mortgage
          loans in accordance  with the Farmer Mac  requirements  either through
          its own staff or through contractors and originators;
     o    maintaining a minimum adjusted net worth of $1.0 million;
     o    maintaining  a  fidelity  bond  and  errors  and  omissions  insurance
          coverage (or acceptable substitute insurance coverage) in a prescribed
          amount according to the size of the institution; and
     o    entering into a Seller/Servicer  agreement to comply with the terms of
          the Farmer Mac Seller/Servicer  Guide,  including  representations and
          warranties regarding the eligibility of the loans and accuracy of loan
          data provided to Farmer Mac.

      Servicing

     Farmer Mac generally does not directly service loans held in its portfolio,
although  it does  act as  "master  servicer"  for  pools  of  loans  and  loans
underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities and may assume direct servicing for
impaired  loans.  Farmer  Mac's  loans and the loans  underlying  its Farmer Mac
Guaranteed   Securities  are  serviced  only  by  Farmer  Mac-approved  entities
designated  as "central  servicers"  that have entered  into  central  servicing
contracts  with Farmer Mac.  Sellers of  eligible  mortgage  loans sold into the
Farmer Mac I program have a right to retain certain "field servicing"  functions
(typically  direct  borrower  contacts) and may enter into contracts with Farmer
Mac's central servicers that specify such servicing functions.  Loans underlying
LTSPCs are  serviced  by the  holders of those  loans in  accordance  with those
lenders'  servicing  procedures,  which are  reviewed and approved by Farmer Mac
before entering into the LTSPC.

      Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities

     Farmer Mac  guarantees  the timely  payment of  principal  and  interest on
Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities.  Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities  backed by
mortgage  loans eligible for the Farmer Mac I program are referred to as "Farmer
Mac I Guaranteed Securities."

     By  statute,  public  offerings  of Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  are
required  to be  registered  with the SEC under  the  federal  securities  laws.
Accordingly,  Farmer Mac, through its subsidiary Farmer Mac Mortgage  Securities
Corporation, maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC through which
Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  may be publicly  offered  from time to time.
Farmer  Mac  also  may  offer  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  in  private,
unregistered  offerings.  U.S. Bank  National  Association,  a national  banking
association based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, or Farmer Mac serves as trustee for
the  trusts  that  acquire  eligible  loans  and  issue  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities.

     Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities are agricultural  mortgage pass-through
certificates  guaranteed by Farmer Mac that  represent  beneficial  interests in
pools of  agricultural  mortgage  loans  or in  obligations  backed  by pools of
agricultural  mortgage  loans.  All Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  issued
during and since  1996 have been  single  class or  multiclass  "grantor  trust"
pass-through certificates.  These securities entitle each investor in a class of
securities to receive a portion of the payments of principal and interest on the
related underlying pool of loans equal to the investor's  proportionate interest
in the pool.  These  securities  also may support  other Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities,  including  real  estate  mortgage  investment  conduit  securities,
commonly  referred  to  as  REMICs,  and  other   agricultural   mortgage-backed
securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the enactment of
changes to Farmer Mac's statutory  charter in 1996 are supported by unguaranteed
first-loss subordinated interests that represented ten percent of the balance of
the loans underlying the securities at issuance.

     Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  are not assets of Farmer Mac,  except
when acquired for  investment  purposes,  and are not recorded as liabilities on
Farmer Mac's consolidated  financial statements.  Farmer Mac, however, is liable
under its guarantee on the  securities  to make timely  payments to investors of
principal  (including  balloon  payments)  and interest  based on the  scheduled
payments on the  underlying  loans,  regardless of whether the grantor trust has
actually received such scheduled payments. Because it guarantees timely payments
on Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  Farmer Mac assumes the ultimate  credit
risk of borrower defaults on the underlying  loans,  which are subject to Farmer
Mac's underwriting  standards  described above in "--Underwriting  and Appraisal
Standards."  See  also  "Management's   Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations--Risk Management--Credit Risk - Loans."

     Farmer Mac receives guarantee fees in return for its guarantee  obligations
on  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities.  These  fees  are  collected  out  of
installment  payments made on the  underlying  loans until those loans have been
repaid or otherwise liquidated (generally as a result of default). The aggregate
amount of guarantee fees received on Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities depends
upon the amount of such  securities  outstanding  and on the guarantee fee rate,
which is capped by statute at 50 basis  points  (0.50  percent)  per annum.  The
Farmer Mac I guarantee  fee rate  typically  ranges  from 40 to 50 basis  points
(0.40 to 0.50 percent) per annum,  depending on the credit  quality of and other
criteria  regarding the loans. The amount of Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities
outstanding is influenced by the repayment rates on the underlying  loans and by
the rate at which Farmer Mac issues new Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities.  In
general,  when the level of  interest  rates  declines  significantly  below the
interest rates on loans underlying Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities,  the rate
of prepayments is likely to increase; conversely, when interest rates rise above
the interest rates on the loans underlying  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,
the rate of  prepayments  is likely to  decrease.  In  addition  to  changes  in
interest  rates,  the rate of  principal  payments  on Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed
Securities is also  influenced by a variety of economic,  demographic  and other
considerations,  including yield maintenance provisions that are associated with
many of the  loans  underlying  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities.  For more
information regarding yield maintenance provisions, see "Management's Discussion
and   Analysis  of   Financial   Condition   and  Results  of   Operations--Risk
Management--Interest Rate Risk."

     For each of the years ended  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  Farmer Mac sold
Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  in the amounts of $91.4  million and $78.3
million,  respectively,  principally  to a related  party.  In 2004,  Farmer Mac
recognized  a $0.4  million  gain on the sale of $26.9  million  of  Farmer  Mac
Guaranteed  Securities.  In 2003 and 2002, Farmer Mac recognized no gain or loss
on any such  sale.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial
Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations--Business Volume."


      Farmer Mac I Transactions

     During the year ended  December  31, 2004,  Farmer Mac  purchased or placed
under  guarantee  or LTSPC $0.5 billion of loans under the Farmer Mac I program.
As of December 31, 2004, loans held and loans underlying Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities  and LTSPCs  totaled $4.7 billion.  The 1996 Act revised Farmer Mac's
statutory  charter to eliminate  the  requirement  of a first-loss  subordinated
interest in Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities.  As of December 31, 2004, $18.6
million  of Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  issued  prior to the 1996 Act
remained outstanding.

     The  following  table  summarizes  loans  purchased  or newly  placed under

      Funding of Guarantee and Purchase Commitment Obligations


     The  principal   sources  of  funding  for  the  payment  of  Farmer  Mac's
obligations  under its guarantees and LTSPCs are the fees for its guarantees and
commitments,  net interest income and the proceeds of debt issuance.  Farmer Mac
satisfies  its  guarantee  and purchase  commitment  obligations  by  purchasing
defaulted  loans  out of LTSPCs  and from the  related  trusts  for  Farmer  Mac
Guaranteed  Securities.  Farmer Mac typically recovers a significant  portion of
the value of defaulted loans purchased  either through borrower  payments,  loan
payoffs,  payments  by third  parties or  foreclosure  and sale of the  property
securing the loans.  Ultimate  losses  arising from Farmer Mac's  guarantees and
commitments are reflected in the Corporation's charge-offs against its allowance
for losses and gains and losses on the sale of real estate  owned.  During 2004,
Farmer Mac's net charge-offs were $4.5 million,  compared to $5.2 million in net
charge-offs  during  2003.  Net gains on the sale of real estate owned were $0.5
million and $0.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.  The Act requires  Farmer Mac to set aside,  as an  allowance  for
losses in a reserve  account,  a portion of the guarantee  fees it receives from
its  guarantee  activities.  Among other  things,  that reserve  account must be
exhausted before Farmer Mac may issue  obligations to the U.S.  Treasury against
the $1.5 billion  Farmer Mac is  statutorily  authorized to borrow from the U.S.
Treasury to fulfill its guarantee  obligations.  That borrowing authority is not
intended to be a routine funding source and has never been used.

     Although total outstanding  guarantees and LTSPCs exceed the amount held as
an  allowance  for losses and the amount it may borrow  from the U.S.  Treasury,
Farmer Mac does not expect its  obligations  under the  guarantees and LTSPCs to
exceed amounts available to satisfy those obligations. For information regarding
the allowance for losses, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations--Risk Management--Credit Risk - Loans," Note
2(j) and Note 8 to the consolidated  financial  statements.  For a more detailed
discussion  of Farmer Mac's  borrowing  authority  from the U.S.  Treasury,  see
"Farmer Mac's Authority to Borrow from the U.S. Treasury."


      Portfolio Diversification

     It is Farmer  Mac's  policy to  diversify  its  portfolio of loans held and
loans   underlying   Farmer  Mac   Guaranteed   Securities   and  LTSPCs,   both
geographically  and by  agricultural  commodity/product.  Farmer Mac directs its
marketing efforts toward  agricultural  lenders throughout the nation to achieve
commodity/product and geographic diversification in its exposure to credit risk.
Farmer Mac measures its credit  exposure in  particular  geographic  regions and
commodities/products  as a percentage of the total principal amount of all loans
outstanding,  adjusted  for the credit  quality of the loans in that  particular
geographic  region  or  commodity/product   group  based  on  its  criteria  for
underwriting discussed above.

     Farmer  Mac is  not  obligated  to buy  every  loan  submitted  to it by an
eligible seller that meets its underwriting and appraisal standards.  Farmer Mac
considers other factors such as its overall portfolio diversification, commodity
and farming  forecasts and risk  management  objectives  in deciding  whether to
accept  the loans  into the  Farmer Mac I  program.  For  example,  if  industry
forecasts  indicate  possible  weakness  in a  geographic  area or  agricultural
commodity  or  product,  Farmer  Mac may  decide  not to  purchase  or commit to
purchase an affected loan as part of managing its overall portfolio  exposure to
areas of possible  heightened  risk  exposure.  Because  Farmer Mac  effectively
assumes   the  credit  risk  on  all  loans   under  an  LTSPC,   Farmer   Mac's
commodity/product and geographic  diversification  disclosures reflect all loans
under  LTSPCs and any loans that have been  purchased  out of LTSPC  pools.  For
information  regarding the  diversification of Farmer Mac's existing  portfolio,
see "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations--Risk Management--Credit Risk - Loans" and Note 8 to the consolidated
financial statements.


Farmer Mac II

      General

     The Farmer Mac II program was  initiated  in 1992 and is  authorized  under
sections  8.0(3) and  8.0(9)(B)  of Farmer  Mac's  statutory  charter (12 U.S.C.
sections 2279aa(3) and 2279aa(9)(B)), which provide that:

     o    USDA-guaranteed portions are statutorily included in the definition of
          loans eligible for Farmer Mac's secondary market programs;
     o    USDA-guaranteed portions are exempted from the underwriting, appraisal
          and repayment  standards that all other loans must meet to be eligible
          for Farmer Mac programs, and are exempted from any diversification and
          internal  credit  enhancement  that may be  required of pools of other
          loans eligible for Farmer Mac programs; and
     o    Farmer  Mac is  authorized  to pool and issue  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
          Securities backed by USDA-guaranteed portions.

      United States Department of Agriculture Guaranteed Loan Programs

     The United States  Department of Agriculture  ("USDA"),  acting through its
various agencies,  currently administers the federal rural credit programs first
developed in the mid-1930s.  The USDA makes direct loans and guarantees portions
of loans made and serviced by USDA-qualified  lenders for various purposes.  The
USDA's guarantee is supported by the full faith and credit of the United States.
USDA-guaranteed  portions  represent up to 95 percent of the principal amount of
guaranteed loans.

     Through its Farmer Mac II program,  Farmer Mac is one of several  competing
purchasers of  USDA-guaranteed  portions of farm ownership loans, farm operating
loans,  business and industry loans and other loans that are fully guaranteed as
to principal and interest by the USDA (collectively, the "guaranteed loans").


      USDA Guarantees. Each USDA guarantee is a full faith and credit obligation
of the United States and becomes enforceable if a lender fails to repurchase the
USDA-guaranteed portion from its owner within 30 days after written demand from
the owner when:

     o    the borrower under the guaranteed  loan is in default not less than 60
          days  in  the  payment  of  any  principal  or  interest  due  on  the
          USDA-guaranteed portion; or
     o    the lender has  failed to remit to the owner the  payment  made by the
          borrower on the  USDA-guaranteed  portion or any related  loan subsidy
          within 30 days after the lender's receipt of the payment.

     If the lender does not repurchase the  USDA-guaranteed  portion as provided
above,  the USDA is  required to purchase  the unpaid  principal  balance of the
USDA-guaranteed  portion  together  with accrued  interest  (including  any loan
subsidy) to the date of purchase,  less the servicing fee,  within 30 days after
written  demand upon the USDA by the owner.  While the USDA  guarantee  will not
cover the note interest to the owner on USDA-guaranteed  portions accruing after
90 days from the date of the original  demand  letter of the owner to the lender
requesting  repurchase,  Farmer Mac has established procedures to require prompt
tendering of USDA-guaranteed portions.

     If, in the opinion of the lender (with the  concurrence  of the USDA) or in
the opinion of the USDA, repurchase of the USDA-guaranteed  portion is necessary
to service  the  related  guaranteed  loan  adequately,  the owner will sell the
USDA-guaranteed  portion to the lender or USDA for an amount equal to the unpaid
principal  balance and accrued  interest  (including  any loan  subsidy) on such
USDA-guaranteed  portion less the lender's  servicing fee.  Federal  regulations
prohibit the lender from  repurchasing  USDA-guaranteed  portions for  arbitrage
purposes.

     Lenders.  Any lender authorized by the USDA to obtain a USDA guarantee on a
loan may be a seller in the Farmer Mac II  program.  As of  December  31,  2004,
there were 133 active sellers in the Farmer Mac II program, consisting mostly of
community and regional  banks,  compared to 150 sellers as of December 31, 2003,
for a decrease of 17 active  lenders.  In the  aggregate,  more than 360 sellers
were actively  participating either directly or indirectly in one or both of the
Farmer Mac I or Farmer Mac II programs during 2004.

     Loan  Servicing.  The  lender  on  each  guaranteed  loan  is  required  by
regulation to retain the unguaranteed portion of the guaranteed loan, to service
the entire underlying  guaranteed loan,  including the USDA-guaranteed  portion,
and to remain  mortgagee  and/or  secured party of record.  The  USDA-guaranteed
portion and the unguaranteed portion of the underlying guaranteed loan are to be
secured  by the same  security  with equal lien  priority.  The  USDA-guaranteed
portion cannot be paid later than, or in any way be subordinated to, the related
unguaranteed portion.


      Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities

     Farmer Mac  guarantees  the timely  payment of  principal  and  interest on
Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities backed by USDA-guaranteed  portions.  Farmer
Mac does not guarantee the repayment of the USDA-guaranteed  portions,  only the
Farmer Mac II Guaranteed Securities that are backed by USDA-guaranteed portions.
In  addition  to  purchasing  USDA-guaranteed  portions  for  retention  in  its
portfolio,  Farmer Mac offers Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities to lenders in
swap transactions or to other investors for cash.

     During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, Farmer Mac issued $174.1

Financing

      Debt Issuance

     Section  8.6(e) of Farmer  Mac's  statutory  charter  (12  U.S.C.  sections
2279aa-6(e))  authorizes  Farmer  Mac to  issue  debt  obligations  to  purchase
eligible  mortgage  loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and to maintain
reasonable amounts for business operations, including adequate liquidity. Farmer
Mac  funds  its  program  purchases   primarily  by  issuing  debt  obligations,
consisting of discount notes and medium-term notes of various maturities, in the
public capital  markets.  Farmer Mac also issues  discount notes and medium-term
notes  to  obtain  funds to  finance  its  investments,  transaction  costs  and
guarantee and LTSPC payments.

     The  Corporation's  discount notes and medium-term notes are obligations of
Farmer Mac only,  are not rated by a nationally  recognized  statistical  rating
organization  ("NRSRO").  The interest and principal  thereon are not guaranteed
by, and do not constitute  debts or obligations  of, FCA or the United States or
any agency or instrumentality of the United States other than Farmer Mac. Farmer
Mac is an  institution  of the FCS, but is not liable for any debt or obligation
of any other  institution  of the FCS.  Likewise,  neither the FCS nor any other
individual institution of the FCS is liable for any debt or obligation of Farmer
Mac.  Income to the purchaser of a Farmer Mac discount note or medium-term  note
is not exempt under federal law from federal, state or local taxation.

     Farmer Mac's board of directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion outstanding of discount notes and medium-term notes, subject to periodic
review  of the  adequacy  of that  level  relative  to  Farmer  Mac's  borrowing
requirements. Farmer Mac invests the proceeds of such issuances in loans, Farmer
Mac Guaranteed  Securities and non-program  investment assets in accordance with
policies  established by its board of directors.  The current policies authorize
non-program investments in:

     o    U.S. Treasury obligations;
     o    agency and instrumentality obligations;
     o    repurchase agreements;
     o    commercial paper;
     o    guaranteed investment contracts;
     o    certificates of deposit;
     o    federal funds and bankers acceptances;
     o    securities and debt obligations of corporate and municipal issuers;
     o    auction rate securities;
     o    mortgage-backed securities;
     o    asset-backed securities;
     o    corporate money market funds; and
     o    preferred stock of government-sponsored enterprises ("GSEs").


For  more   information   about  Farmer  Mac's   outstanding   investments   and
indebtedness, see Note 4 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

      Equity Issuance


     The Act  authorizes  Farmer Mac to issue voting  common  stock,  non-voting
common  stock and  non-voting  preferred  stock.  Only  banks,  other  financial
entities,   insurance   companies  and  institutions  of  the  FCS  eligible  to
participate  in one or more of the Farmer Mac  programs  may hold voting  common
stock.  No holder of Class A voting common stock may directly or indirectly be a
beneficial  owner of more than 33 percent of the  outstanding  shares of Class A
voting common stock. There are no ownership  restrictions  applicable to Class C
non-voting common stock or preferred stock.

     The Class C  non-voting  common  stock and the  preferred  stock are freely
transferable.  Upon  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up of the business of
Farmer Mac, after payment and provision for payment of  outstanding  debt of the
Corporation,  the holders of shares of preferred  stock would be paid in full at
par value,  plus all accrued  dividends,  before the holders of shares of common
stock  received any payment.  The  dividend  rights of all three  classes of the
Corporation's  common stock are the same,  and  dividends  may be paid on common
stock only when,  as, and if declared by Farmer  Mac's board of directors in its
sole  discretion,  subject to the payment of dividends on outstanding  preferred
stock.


     As of December 31, 2004,  1,030,780  shares of Class A voting common stock,
500,301  shares of Class B voting  common  stock,  10,291,041  shares of Class C
non-voting common stock and 700,000 shares of 6.40 percent non-voting cumulative
preferred stock,  Series A were  outstanding.  Farmer Mac may obtain  additional
capital  from  future  issuances  of  voting  and  non-voting  common  stock and
non-voting  preferred  stock.  Farmer Mac has no present  intention to issue any
additional  shares  of  common  stock,  except  pursuant  to  programs  in which
employees, members of management or the board of directors may be granted or may
purchase Class C non-voting  common stock, or exercise options to purchase Class
C non-voting common stock granted as part of their compensation arrangements.

     Farmer  Mac's  ability to declare and pay common stock  dividends  could be
restricted  if  it  were  to  fail  to  comply  with  its   regulatory   capital
requirements.   See  Note  9  to  the  consolidated   financial  statements  and
"--Government      Regulation      of      Farmer       Mac--Regulation--Capital
Standards--Enforcement levels."


     The  cumulative  preferred  stock,  Series  A has a  redemption  price  and
liquidation  preference of $50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
The preferred  stock does not have a maturity date.  Beginning on June 30, 2012,
Farmer Mac has the option to redeem the preferred stock at any time, in whole or
in part, at the  redemption  price of $50.00 per share,  plus accrued and unpaid
dividends  through and including the  redemption  date. The costs of issuing the
preferred  stock were charged to  additional  paid-in  capital.  Farmer Mac pays
cumulative  dividends on the preferred stock  quarterly in arrears,  when and if
declared by the board of  directors.  Farmer Mac's  ability to declare and pay a

     On August 4, 2004,  Farmer Mac established a program to repurchase up to 10
percent of the  Corporation's  outstanding  Class C non-voting common stock. The
authority for this stock repurchase program expires in August 2006. During 2004,
Farmer Mac repurchased  299,248 shares of its Class C non-voting common stock at
an  average  price of $20.82  per  share.  All of the  repurchased  shares  were
purchased in open market  transactions and were retired to become authorized but
unissued shares available for future issuance.

             FARMER MAC'S AUTHORITY TO BORROW FROM THE U.S. TREASURY

     Farmer Mac may, in extreme  circumstances,  issue  obligations  to the U.S.
Treasury in a cumulative amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. The proceeds of such
obligations  may be used  solely for the  purpose  of  fulfilling  Farmer  Mac's
guarantee commitments under the Farmer Mac I and Farmer Mac II programs. The Act
provides  that the U.S.  Treasury is required to purchase  such  obligations  of
Farmer Mac if Farmer Mac certifies that:

     o    a portion of the  guarantee  fees  assessed by Farmer Mac has been set
          aside  as a  reserve  against  losses  arising  out  of  Farmer  Mac's
          guarantee  activities in an amount determined by Farmer Mac's board of
          directors to be necessary and such reserve has been exhausted; and
     o    the proceeds of such  obligations  are needed to fulfill  Farmer Mac's
          guarantee obligations.

Such obligations would bear interest at a rate determined by the U.S.  Treasury,
taking into consideration the average rate on outstanding marketable obligations
of the United States as of the last day of the last calendar month ending before
the date of the  purchase  of the  obligations  from  Farmer  Mac,  and would be
required  to be  repurchased  from the U.S.  Treasury  by  Farmer  Mac  within a
"reasonable time."

     The United States government does not guarantee  payments due on Farmer Mac
Guaranteed Securities, funds invested in the equity or debt securities of Farmer
Mac, any dividend payments on shares of Farmer Mac stock or the profitability of
Farmer Mac.


                       GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF FARMER MAC

General

     Public  offerings of Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  must be registered
with the SEC under the federal  securities laws.  Farmer Mac also is required to
file reports with the SEC pursuant to the SEC's periodic reporting requirements.

Regulation

      Office of Secondary Market Oversight

     As an  institution  of the FCS,  Farmer Mac is  subject  to the  regulatory
authority of FCA. FCA, acting through its Office of Secondary Market  Oversight,
has general regulatory and enforcement  authority over Farmer Mac, including the
authority to promulgate rules and regulations governing the activities of Farmer
Mac  and to  apply  its  general  enforcement  powers  to  Farmer  Mac  and  its
activities.  The Director of the Office of Secondary  Market  Oversight,  who is
selected by and reports to the FCA board,  is responsible for the examination of
Farmer Mac and the  general  supervision  of the safe and sound  performance  by
Farmer Mac of the powers and duties vested in it by the Act. The Act requires an
annual  examination of the financial  transactions  of Farmer Mac and authorizes
FCA to assess Farmer Mac for the cost of its  regulatory  activities,  including
the cost of any examination. Farmer Mac is required to file quarterly reports of
condition with FCA.


      Department of the Treasury

     In  connection  with the passage of the 1996 Act, the Chairmen of the House
and Senate  Agriculture  Committees  requested FCA, in a cooperative effort with
the  Department  of the  Treasury,  to "monitor  and review the  operations  and
financial  condition  of Farmer Mac and to report in writing to the  appropriate
subcommittees of the House Agriculture  Committee,  the House Financial Services
Committee  and the Senate  Agriculture,  Nutrition  and  Forestry  Committee  at
six-month   intervals  during  the  capital  deferral  period  and  beyond,   if
necessary."  The  "capital  deferral  period"  expired on  January 1, 1999,  the
risk-based capital rule went into effect on May 23, 2002 and the FCA reports and
monitoring continue.


      Capital Standards

      General. The Act, as amended by the 1996 Act, establishes three capital
standards for Farmer Mac:

     o    Minimum  capital - Farmer Mac's minimum  capital level is an amount of
          core  capital  equal  to the  sum of  2.75  percent  of  Farmer  Mac's
          aggregate  on-balance  sheet  assets,  as  calculated  for  regulatory
          purposes,  plus 0.75  percent of Farmer  Mac's  aggregate  off-balance
          sheet obligations, specifically including:
          o    the unpaid principal balance of outstanding Farmer Mac Guaranteed
               Securities;
          o    instruments   issued  or   guaranteed  by  Farmer  Mac  that  are
               substantially  equivalent  to Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,
               including LTSPCs; and
          o    other off-balance sheet obligations of Farmer Mac.
     o    Critical capital - Farmer Mac's critical capital level is an amount of
          core  capital  equal  to 50  percent  of  the  total  minimum  capital
          requirement at that time.
     o    Risk-based  capital - The Act  directs FCA to  establish a  risk-based
          capital  stress  test for  Farmer  Mac,  using  specified  stress-test
          parameters.  While  the Act does not  specify  the  required  level of
          risk-based  capital,  that level is permitted to exceed the  statutory
          minimum capital requirement  applicable to Farmer Mac, if so indicated
          by the risk-based capital stress test.

Farmer  Mac is  required  to  comply  with the  higher  of the  minimum  capital
requirement or the risk-based capital requirement.

     FCA issued its final risk-based  capital regulation for Farmer Mac on April
12,  2001  and the  Corporation  was  required  to meet the  risk-based  capital
standards  beginning  on May  23,  2002.  The  risk-based  capital  stress  test
promulgated  by FCA is intended to determine  the amount of  regulatory  capital
(core  capital  plus the  allowance  for losses,  but  excluding  the  valuation
allowance for real estate owned) that Farmer Mac would need to maintain positive
capital  during a ten-year  period in which:

     o    annual  losses  occur at a rate of default  and  severity  "reasonably
          related" to the rates of the highest sequential two-years in a limited
          U.S. geographic area; and
     o    interest  rates  increase  to a level equal to the lesser of 600 basis
          points or 50 percent of the ten-year U.S.  Treasury rate, and interest
          rates remain at such level for the remainder of the period.

The  risk-based  capital  stress test then adds an  additional 30 percent to the
resulting  capital  requirement  for  management and  operational  risk. FCA has
published its intent to review the  risk-based  capital  regulation.  Farmer Mac
does not know  what  action,  if any,  the  Agency  will take as a result of its
review of the risk-based  capital  requirement,  although any action taken would
likely increase the requirement,  nor when any changes to the requirement  would
become effective.

     As of  December  31,  2004,  Farmer  Mac's  minimum  and  critical  capital
requirements were $128.9 million and $64.5 million, respectively, and its actual
core capital level was $237.7 million,  $108.8 million above the minimum capital
requirement and $173.2 million above the critical capital requirement.  Based on
the risk-based capital stress test, Farmer Mac's risk-based capital  requirement
as of December 31, 2004 was $37.1 million and Farmer Mac's regulatory capital of
$254.8  million  exceeded  that  amount by  approximately  $217.7  million.  See
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations--Liquidity  and  Capital   Resources--Capital   Requirements"  for  a
presentation of Farmer Mac's current regulatory capital position.

     Enforcement  levels.  The Act directs FCA to classify Farmer Mac within one
of four enforcement  levels for purposes of determining  compliance with capital
standards.  As of December 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac was  classified as within level
I--the highest compliance level.

     Failure to comply with the  applicable  required  capital  level in the Act
would  result  in Farmer  Mac being  classified  as within  level II (below  the
applicable risk-based capital level, but above the minimum capital level), level
III (below the minimum capital level,  but above the critical  capital level) or
level IV (below the critical  capital level).  In the event that Farmer Mac were
classified  as within  level II, III or IV, the Act requires the Director of the
Office of Secondary Market  Oversight to take a number of mandatory  supervisory
measures and provides the Director with discretionary  authority to take various
optional  supervisory  measures  depending  on the level in which  Farmer Mac is
classified. The mandatory measures applicable to level II include:

     o    requiring  Farmer Mac to submit and comply with a capital  restoration
          plan;
     o    prohibiting  the payment of dividends if such payment  would result in
          Farmer Mac being reclassified as within level III or IV, and requiring
          the  pre-approval  of any dividend  payment even if such payment would
          not result in reclassification as within level IV; and
     o    reclassifying  Farmer Mac as within  level III if it does not submit a
          capital  restoration  plan that is  approved by the  Director,  or the
          Director determines that Farmer Mac has failed to make, in good faith,
          reasonable efforts to comply with such a plan and fulfill the schedule
          for the plan approved by the Director.

The mandatory measures applicable to level III include:

     o    requiring Farmer Mac to submit (and comply with) a capital restoration
          plan;
     o    prohibiting  the payment of dividends if such payment  would result in
          Farmer Mac being  reclassified  as within level IV and  requiring  the
          pre-approval  of any dividend  payment even if such payment  would not
          result in reclassification as within level IV; and
     o    reclassifying Farmer Mac as within a lower level if it does not submit
          a capital  restoration  plan that is approved  by the  Director or the
          Director determines that Farmer Mac has failed to make, in good faith,
          reasonable efforts to comply with such a plan and fulfill the schedule
          for the plan approved by the Director.

     If Farmer Mac were classified as within level III, then, in addition to the
foregoing  mandatory  supervisory  measures,  the  Director  of  the  Office  of
Secondary  Market  Oversight  could  take  any  of the  following  discretionary
supervisory measures:

     o    imposing  limits on any increase in, or ordering the reduction of, any
          obligations of Farmer Mac, including off-balance sheet obligations;
     o    limiting or  prohibiting  asset growth or requiring  the  reduction of
          assets;
     o    requiring the  acquisition  of new capital in an amount  sufficient to
          provide for reclassification as within a higher level;
     o    terminating,   reducing  or   modifying   any  activity  the  Director
          determines creates excessive risk to Farmer Mac; or
     o    appointing a conservator or a receiver for Farmer Mac.

The  Act  does  not  specify  any  supervisory  measures,  either  mandatory  or
discretionary,  to be  taken  by the  Director  in the  event  Farmer  Mac  were
classified as within level IV.

     The  Director  of  the  Office  of  Secondary   Market  Oversight  has  the
discretionary  authority to  reclassify  Farmer Mac to a level that is one level
below its then  current  level  (for  example,  from level I to level II) if the
Director  determines  that Farmer Mac is engaging in any action not  approved by
the Director  that could  result in a rapid  depletion of core capital or if the
value of property subject to mortgages backing Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities
has decreased significantly.

Item 2. Properties

     Farmer Mac currently occupies its principal  offices,  which are located at
1133 Twenty-First  Street,  N.W., Suite 600,  Washington,  D.C. 20036, under the

     (a) Farmer Mac has three classes of common stock outstanding.  Ownership of
Class A voting  common stock is  restricted  to banks,  insurance  companies and
other financial  institutions or similar  entities that are not  institutions of
the FCS.  Ownership of Class B voting common stock is restricted to institutions
of the FCS. There are no ownership restrictions on the Class C non-voting common
stock.  Under the terms of the original public offering of the Class A and Class
B voting  common  stock,  the  Corporation  reserved the right to redeem at book
value any shares of either class held by an ineligible holder.


     The Class A and Class C common stocks trade on the New York Stock  Exchange
under the symbols AGMA and AGM,  respectively.  The Class B voting common stock,
which has a limited market and trades  infrequently,  is not listed or quoted on
any  exchange  or other  medium,  and  Farmer  Mac is  unaware  of any  publicly
available quotations or prices for that class.

     The information  below represents the high and low closing sales prices for
the Class A and Class C common  stocks for the periods  indicated as reported by

     As of March 1, 2005,  it was  estimated  that  there were 1,381  registered
owners of the Class A voting common stock, 100 registered  owners of the Class B
voting common stock and 1,305 registered owners of the Class C non-voting common
stock.

     The dividend rights of all three classes of the Corporation's  common stock
are the same,  and  dividends  may be paid on common stock only when,  as and if
declared by Farmer Mac's board of directors  in its sole  discretion.  In August
2004,  Farmer  Mac's  board of  directors  adopted a policy  to pay a  quarterly
dividend of $0.10 per share on all  classes of the  Corporation's  common  stock
beginning in fourth  quarter 2004. On October 7, 2004, for the first time Farmer
Mac's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the
Corporation's  three  classes of common  stock,  which was paid on December  31,
2004. Prior to that dividend  payment,  Farmer Mac had not paid any dividends on
its common  stock.  On  February  10,  2005,  the Farmer Mac board of  directors
declared a  quarterly  dividend of $0.10 per share on the  Corporation's  common
stock  payable  on March  31,  2005.  Farmer  Mac  expects  to  continue  to pay
comparable  quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future,  subject to the
outlook and indicated  capital needs of the Corporation and the determination of
the board of directors.  Farmer Mac's ability to declare and pay dividends could
be restricted if it were to fail to comply with regulatory capital requirements.
See   "Business--Government   Regulation   of  Farmer   Mac--Regulation--Capital
Standards--Enforcement  levels."  Farmer Mac's  ability to pay  dividends on its
common  stock is also  subject to the payment of  dividends  on its  outstanding
preferred stock.

     Information  about  securities  authorized  for issuance under Farmer Mac's
equity  compensation plans appears under "Equity  Compensation  Plans" in Farmer
Mac's Proxy  Statement to be filed on or about April 28,  2005.  That portion of
the Proxy Statement is incorporated by reference into this report.

     Farmer Mac is a federally  chartered  instrumentality  of the United States
and its common stock is exempt from registration  pursuant to Section 3(a)(2) of
the Securities Act of 1933. On October 4, 2004,  pursuant to Farmer Mac's policy
that  permits  directors  of Farmer  Mac to elect to  receive  shares of Class C
non-voting  common  stock in lieu of their  annual  cash  retainers,  Farmer Mac
issued an aggregate of 670 shares of its Class C non-voting  common stock, at an
issue price of $22.19 per share,  to the eight  directors who elected to receive
such stock in lieu of their cash retainers.

     (b) Not applicable.

     (c) As shown in the table below,  Farmer Mac repurchased  228,297 shares of
its Class C non-voting  common stock  during  fourth  quarter 2004 at an average
price of $21.10 per share. All of the repurchased  shares were purchased in open
market  transactions  and were retired to become  authorized but unissued shares
available for future issuance.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

     Financial  information  as of and for each of the years ended  December 31,
2004,  2003 and 2002 is  consolidated  to include the accounts of Farmer Mac and
its wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities  Corporation.  The
following  discussion  should be read  together  with Farmer Mac's  consolidated
financial statements and is not necessarily indicative of future results.

Forward-Looking Statements


     There are  statements  made in this  Form  10-K  that are  "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act
of 1995  pertaining  to  management's  current  expectations  as to Farmer Mac's
future  financial  results,   business  prospects  and  business   developments.
Forward-looking  statements  include any statement  that may predict,  forecast,
indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and typically are
accompanied by, and identified  with, such terms as  "anticipates,"  "believes,"
"expects," "intends," "should" and similar phrases. The following discussion and
analysis includes forward-looking statements addressing Farmer Mac's:

     o    prospects for earnings;
     o    prospects for growth in loan purchase,  guarantee,  securitization and
          LTSPC volume;
     o    trends in net interest income;
     o    trends in provisions for losses;
     o    trends in expenses;
     o    changes in capital position; and
     o    other business and financial matters.

Management's  expectations for Farmer Mac's future necessarily  involve a number
of  assumptions  and  estimates and the  evaluation of risks and  uncertainties.
Various  factors  could cause Farmer  Mac's  actual  results or events to differ
materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements, including uncertainties regarding:

     o    the rate and  direction of  development  of the  secondary  market for
          agricultural mortgage loans;
     o    the possible  establishment  of  additional  statutory  or  regulatory
          restrictions or constraints on Farmer Mac that could hamper its growth
          or diminish its profitability;
     o    increases  in general  and  administrative  expenses  attributable  to
          growth of the business and the regulatory  environment,  including the
          hiring of additional personnel with expertise in key functional areas;
     o    legislative or regulatory  developments or  interpretations  of Farmer
          Mac's statutory  charter that could  adversely  affect Farmer Mac, the
          ability  of  Farmer  Mac to  offer  new  products  or the  ability  or
          motivation of certain  lenders to  participate  in its programs or the
          terms of any such  participation,  or increase the cost of  regulation
          and related corporate activities;
     o    possible  reaction in the financial  markets to events  involving GSEs
          other than Farmer Mac;
     o    Farmer Mac's access to the debt markets at favorable rates and terms;
     o    the  possible  effect of the  risk-based  capital  requirement,  which
          could,  under  certain  circumstances,  be in excess of the  statutory
          minimum capital requirement;
     o    the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness;
     o    lender  interest  in Farmer  Mac  credit  products  and the Farmer Mac
          secondary market;
     o    borrower    preferences   for   fixed-rate    agricultural    mortgage
          indebtedness;
     o    competitive  pressures in the purchase of agricultural  mortgage loans
          and the  sale of  agricultural  mortgage-backed  securities  and  debt
          securities;
     o    substantial  changes in  interest  rates,  agricultural  land  values,
          commodity prices,  export demand for U.S. agricultural  products,  the
          general economy and other factors that may affect  delinquency  levels
          and credit losses;
     o    protracted  adverse  weather,  market  or other  conditions  affecting
          particular geographic regions or particular  agricultural  commodities
          or products related to agricultural  mortgage loans backing Farmer Mac
          I Guaranteed Securities or under LTSPCs;
     o    the willingness of investors to invest in agricultural mortgage-backed
          securities; or
     o    the effects on the  agricultural  economy or the value of agricultural
          real estate of any changes in federal assistance for agriculture.

The  foregoing  factors are not  exhaustive.  Other  sections of this report may
include additional factors that could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and
its financial  performance.  Furthermore,  new risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor
assess the  effects of such  factors on Farmer  Mac's  business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially  from the  expectations  expressed or implied by the  forward-looking
statements.  In light of  these  potential  risks  and  uncertainties,  no undue
reliance should be placed on any  forward-looking  statements  expressed in this
report. Furthermore, Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the
results  of  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  that may be made to
reflect any future events or circumstances,  except as otherwise mandated by the
SEC.


Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates

     The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting  principals  generally accepted in the United States requires the use
of  estimates  and  assumptions   that  affect  the  amounts   reported  in  the
consolidated  financial  statements and related notes for the periods presented.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policy
that is both important to the portrayal of Farmer Mac's financial  condition and
results  of  operations  and  requires  complex,  subjective  judgments  is  the
accounting  policy for the  allowance  for losses.  Farmer Mac's  allowance  for
losses is presented in four components on its consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned, net of valuation allowance";
     o    a  "Contingent  obligation  for probable  losses" on loans  underlying
          post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  entered
          into or modified  after  January 1, 2003,  for which  inherent  losses
          existed  at the  time of the  guarantee  or  commitment  and  could be
          reasonably estimated, is included in the balance sheet as a portion of
          the amount reported as "Guarantee and commitment obligation"; and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance
          sheet under "Reserve for losses."

     The provision for losses is presented in two components on the consolidated
statement of operations:

     o    a "Provision for loan losses," which represents losses on Farmer Mac's
          loans held for investment; and
     o    a "Provision for losses," which represents  losses on loans underlying
          post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs and real
          estate owned.

     The purpose of the allowance for losses is to provide for estimated  losses
that are  probable to have  occurred as of the  balance  sheet date,  and not to
predict or  account  for  future  potential  losses.  The  determination  of the
allowance for losses requires management to make significant  estimates based on
information  available as of the balance  sheet date,  including the amounts and
timing of losses and current market and economic conditions. These estimates are
subject to change in future reporting periods if such conditions and information
change.  For example,  a decline in the national or  agricultural  economy could
result in an  increase  in  delinquencies  or  foreclosures,  which may  require
additional allowances for losses in future periods.

     Farmer Mac  maintains an allowance for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on loans held for  investment,  real  estate  owned and loans  underlying
post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs.  Farmer  Mac
estimates   probable  losses  using  a  systematic   process  that  begins  with
management's  evaluation of the results of its proprietary  loan pool simulation
and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon  historical
information  from a data set of  agricultural  mortgage  loans  recorded  over a
longer  period of time than Farmer  Mac's own  experience  to date,  screened to
include only those loans with credit  characteristics  similar to those on which
Farmer Mac has  assumed  credit  risk.  The results  generated  by the Model are
modified by the  application  of  management's  judgment as required to take key
factors  into  account,  including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural commodity/product concentrations in Farmer
          Mac's portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.


     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
charged to operating  expenses and reduced by charge-offs for actual losses, net
of recoveries.  Negative provisions for loan losses or provisions for losses are
recorded in the event that the  estimate  of probable  losses as of the end of a
period is lower than the estimate at the  beginning  of the period.  Charge-offs
represent losses on the outstanding  principal  balance,  any interest  payments
previously   accrued  or  advanced  and  expected  costs  of  liquidation.   The
establishment  of and periodic  adjustments to the valuation  allowance for real
estate owned are charged against income as a portion of the provision for losses
charged to operating expense.  Gains and losses on the sale of real estate owned
are recorded in income based on the difference  between the recorded  investment
at the time of sale and liquidation proceeds.


     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States.  As of December 31, 2004, Farmer
Mac had experienced no credit losses on any pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.

     Further  information  regarding  the  allowance  for losses is  included in
"--Risk Management--Credit Risk - Loans."

Results of Operations

     Overview.  Net income  available  to common  stockholders  for 2004 rose to
$28.2 million or $2.32 per diluted  common  share,  compared to $25.0 million or
$2.08 per diluted  common  share in 2003 and $21.3  million or $1.77 per diluted
common share in 2002.

     Farmer Mac's business volume declined in 2004, with  outstanding  guarantee
and LTSPC volume as of December 31, 2004 that was $345.7  million  lower than as
of December 31, 2003. During 2004, Farmer Mac:

     o    added $392.6 million of Farmer Mac I eligible loans under LTSPCs;
     o    purchased  $104.4  million of newly  originated  Farmer Mac I eligible
          loans; and
     o    purchased $174.1 million of Farmer Mac II USDA-guaranteed  portions of
          loans.

     As of December 31, 2004, the percentage of 90-day delinquencies (Farmer Mac
I loans  purchased or placed under Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or LTSPCs
after  changes to Farmer  Mac's  statutory  charter in 1996 that were 90 days or
more past due, in foreclosure, restructured after delinquency, or in bankruptcy,
excluding  loans  performing  under  either  their  original  loan  terms  or  a
court-approved  bankruptcy  plan)  decreased  to 0.55  percent of the  principal
balance  of all loans  held and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs,  compared to 0.60 percent at the end of 2003
and 1.21 percent at the end of 2002.

     After careful  evaluation of the overall  improved credit quality of Farmer
Mac's portfolio,  the strong U.S.  agricultural economy, the recent upward trend
in agricultural land values and the $345.7 million  year-over-year  reduction in
Farmer Mac's outstanding guarantees and commitments,  Farmer Mac determined that
the appropriate  level of allowance for losses as of December 31, 2004 was $17.1
million,  compared to $22.1 million as of December 31, 2003 and $20.0 million as
of December 31, 2002. As a result of this  determination,  Farmer Mac released a
net $0.4  million  from its  allowance  for  losses in 2004,  compared  to total
provisions  for  losses of $7.3  million in 2003 and $8.2  million in 2002.  For
further  discussion  of the change in the allowance for losses and provision for
losses, see "--Risk Management--Credit Risk - Loans."


     As of December 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac had $3.8 million of real estate owned,
compared  to $15.5  million  as of  December  31,  2003 and $5.0  million  as of
December 31, 2002. Prior to acquisition of property  securing a loan, Farmer Mac
develops a  liquidation  strategy  that results in either an  immediate  sale or
retention pending later sale. Farmer Mac evaluates these and other  alternatives
based upon the economics of the  transactions and the requirements of local law.
The  decrease in real estate  owned in 2004 was the result of the lower  default
rate in Farmer Mac's portfolio and the completion of the liquidation  process of
previously  held real estate owned.  Farmer Mac's portfolio also has developed a
core of  loans  that,  though  the  borrowers  on those  loans  have  filed  for
bankruptcy  protection,  are current under the original terms of the loans or as
modified under a court-approved bankruptcy plan.

     The following  table presents  Farmer Mac's  non-performing  assets,  which
aggregates 90-day delinquencies,  loans performing in bankruptcy and real estate
owned.

     Farmer Mac  experienced  $4.5  million in net losses  charged  against  the
allowance for losses in 2004,  compared with $5.2 million in net losses for 2003
and $4.1 million in 2002.  Farmer Mac recorded  gains on the sale of real estate
owned of $0.5  million,  $0.2 million and $0.1  million in 2004,  2003 and 2002,
respectively.  During 2004, Farmer Mac recovered approximately $2.8 million from
three sellers (one of which was a related party) for breaches of representations
and warranties  associated  with prior sales of  agricultural  mortgage loans to
Farmer Mac, which amount Farmer Mac had previously  charged off as losses on the
associated  loans,  consistent  with its  policy on  accounting  for  claims for
breaches of representations and warranties.  As these payments are received from
sellers rather than borrowers, these recoveries are reported as other income and
are not reflected as recoveries in the net losses charged  against the allowance
for losses discussed above.

     As of December 31, 2004,  approximately $1.4 billion (31 percent) of Farmer
Mac's portfolio of post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I loans and loans underlying  LTSPCs
and  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed   Securities  were  in  their  peak  default  years
(approximately  years three  through five after  origination),  compared to $1.7
billion (34 percent) as of December 31, 2003 and $1.8 billion (38 percent) as of
December 31, 2002.  Notwithstanding  the recent  positive  trends in delinquency
rates and the overall  agricultural  economy,  during 2005,  the level of 90-day
delinquencies could increase and higher charge-offs could follow.

     Outlook for 2005.  USDA's most recent  publications (as available on USDA's
website as of March 15, 2005) forecast:

     o    2005  net cash  farm  income  to be 78.1  billion,  exceeding  the two
          successive  record years of $77.8 billion in 2004 and $68.6 billion in
          2003;
     o    2005 net farm income to be $64.4 billion,  which is a decrease of $9.2
          billion from the record  $73.6  billion  estimated  for 2004 but still
          $13.3 million higher than the 10-year average net farm income;
     o    Total  direct  government  payments  to be $24.1  billion in 2005,  an
          increase  from the 2004 estimate of $14.5  billion.  Market prices for
          crops affect direct government payment rates for government  programs;
          USDA anticipates program crop prices to be lower in 2005, due to large
          inventories from 2003 and 2004 bumper crops;
     o    The value of U.S.  farm real estate to increase 4.5 percent in 2005 to
          $1.232  trillion,  a smaller increase as compared to the 2004 increase
          of 5.4  percent.  USDA  is  anticipating  improvement  in the  general
          economy to support further growth in farmland values, though at a rate
          slower than the average annual gain of 5.85 percent since 1999; and
     o    The amount of farm real estate debt to increase by 5.2 percent in 2005
          to $119.5 billion, up from $113.6 billion in 2004.


     The USDA forecast  components  referenced above relate to U.S.  agriculture
generally, but should be favorable for Farmer Mac's financial condition relative
to its exposure to  outstanding  guarantees  and  commitments,  as they indicate
strong  borrower cash flows,  and generally  increased  values in U.S. farm real
estate.

      Factors that  significantly  lowered Farmer Mac's 2004 new business volume
compared to previous years included:

     o    reduced growth rates in the agricultural  mortgage market, due largely
          to the increased liquidity of agricultural borrowers;
     o    increased available capital and liquidity of agricultural lenders;
     o    new  alternative   sources  of  funding  and  credit  enhancement  for
          agricultural lenders;
     o    increased competition in the secondary market for purchases of quality
          agricultural mortgage loans;
     o    adverse publicity about and increased regulatory pressure on GSEs; and
     o    uncertainty   created  by  the  proposed  FCA  regulation   concerning
          risk-weighting of assets held by FCS institutions which, if adopted in
          its current  form,  could  decrease the value of LTSPCs and Farmer Mac
          swaps to those institutions (See "- Regulatory Matters").

These  factors  are  likely to  continue  to  constrain  Farmer  Mac's  business
opportunities and growth through at least 2005.

     As a matter  of  historical  practice,  many  financial  institutions  have
preferred to retain agricultural  mortgage loans in their portfolios rather than
sell  the  loans  into  the   secondary   market.   That   preference   persists
notwithstanding  the  corporate  finance and  capital  planning  benefits  these
institutions  might  otherwise  realize  through  participation  in Farmer Mac's
programs, such as greater liquidity,  greater lending capacity, increased return
on equity, and decreased capital  requirements.  In recent years, the preference
to retain  loans has been  reinforced  by the  stronger  capital  and  liquidity
positions of  agricultural  lenders,  combined with their  willingness to accept
greater asset and liability  mismatch in light of the  significant  differential
between lower,  short-term  interest rates and higher,  long-term  rates.  Those
stronger capital and liquidity positions, in turn, have increased competition in
the origination,  funding and acquisition (for investment) of the limited supply
of new agricultural real estate mortgage lending  opportunities.  Limited supply
and increased demand by FCS institutions,  insurance companies, commercial banks
and other financial  institutions for agricultural  mortgage loans have narrowed
the  investment  returns on those  loans,  as has the  ability  of some  lending
institutions to subsidize,  in effect,  their  agricultural  mortgage loan rates
through  low-return use of equity.  These  conditions  have limited the need for
many  agricultural  lenders to obtain the  benefits  of Farmer  Mac's  programs.
Farmer Mac  expects  these  conditions  to continue  through at least 2005.  See
"--Business Volume."

     Farmer Mac faces  significant  challenges in its efforts to regain its past
business  volume  levels.  Unless the  Corporation  is successful in its current
efforts  to  expand  beyond  its  current  business  with  the FCS and  with the
commercial banks, its business prospects will continue to be constrained.

     To succeed in realizing its business  development and  profitability  goals
over the longer  term,  Farmer Mac must  successfully  market  existing  and new
programs and products to agricultural mortgage lenders. Farmer Mac's outstanding
program  volume as of December 31, 2004 was $5.5 billion,  which  represented 12
percent  of  management's  estimate  of  a  $45.4  billion  market  of  eligible
agricultural  mortgage  loans. As part of its efforts to capture a greater share
of the market,  Farmer Mac is proceeding  with a new  strategic  alliance with a
related party FCS institution and sees additional longer-term opportunities that
could lead to renewed growth in business volume as a result of the Corporation's
marketing  efforts.  Further,  Farmer Mac  believes  that  prospects  for larger
portfolio  transactions  similar to those that have  accounted for a significant
portion of growth in prior  years  continue  to exist,  but,  in light of market
conditions, no assurance can be given at this time as to the certainty or timing
of such  transactions.  While  Farmer Mac will  continue to market  actively its
existing secondary market products,  it also must address the constraints of the
existing  business  environment,  consistent  with  its  charter  and  purposes.
Therefore,  Farmer Mac is  actively  evaluating  new loan  programs  intended to
provide for new, diversified business  opportunities.  In that regard, the Board
and management are carrying out initiatives that include  agribusiness;  federal
and  state  agricultural   finance  programs;   new  arrangements  to  encourage
agricultural  mortgage sales by banks;  and rural  development  associated  with
agriculture.  Some of the  agribusiness and rural  development  initiatives will
require  Farmer Mac to  consider  credit  risks that  expand upon or differ from
those the Corporation has accepted previously.  Farmer Mac will use underwriting
standards  appropriate to those credit risks,  and likely will draw upon outside
expertise  to analyze  and  evaluate  the credit  and  funding  aspects of loans
submitted pursuant to those initiatives. While Farmer Mac is seeking actively to
expand its mix of loan  types  within  the scope of its  Congressional  charter,
investors  are  cautioned  that it is too early to  assess  the  probability  of
success of these efforts.

     During 2004 and 2005 to date,  Farmer Mac has  continued  to  validate  and
enhance  its  risk  management  practices,  internal  controls,  accounting  and
financial reporting,  as a result of ongoing corporate diligence and a number of
regulatory  considerations,  including  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and FCA
requirements, as well as the general regulatory environment for GSEs.

     A detailed  presentation  of Farmer Mac's  financial  results for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 follows.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income,  which does not include guarantee
fees for loans purchased prior to April 1, 2001 (the effective date of Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  140,  Accounting  for  Transfers  and
Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishments of Liabilities ("SFAS 140")),
was $33.2  million for 2004,  $37.3 million for 2003 and $39.1 million for 2002.
The net interest yield was 86 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2004,
compared to 93 basis  points for the year ended  December 31, 2003 and 104 basis
points for the year ended  December 31, 2002. The effect of the adoption of SFAS
140 was a  reclassification  of approximately  $4.1 million (10 basis points) of
guarantee  fee income as interest  income for the year ended  December 31, 2004,
compared to $4.4 million (11 basis points) for the year ended  December 31, 2003
and $2.7 million (7 basis points) for the year ended December 31, 2002.

     In  2003,  the  Chief  Accountant  at  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission  provided  additional  guidance  to  all  registrants  regarding  the
classification  on the  statement  of  operations  of realized  gains and losses
resulting  from  financial  derivatives  that are not in fair value or cash flow
hedge relationships. All registrants were requested to comply with this guidance
in  future  filings  and to  reclassify  this  activity  for all  prior  periods
presented.  As a result of the application of this additional guidance,  the net
interest income and expense  realized on financial  derivatives  that are not in
fair  value or cash flow hedge  relationships  have been  reclassified  from net
interest  income  into gains and losses on  financial  derivatives  and  trading
assets.   For  the  years  ended  December  31,  2004,   2003  and  2002,   this
reclassification  resulted  in a decrease of the net  interest  yield of 5 basis
points, one basis point, and 11 basis points, respectively.

     The net interest  yields for the years ended  December  31, 2004,  2003 and
2002 included the benefits of yield  maintenance  payments  received of 13 basis
points,  12 basis points and 8 basis  points,  respectively.  Yield  maintenance
payments  represent the present value of expected future interest income streams
and  accelerate  the  recognition  of interest  income  from the related  loans.
Because the timing and size of these  payments vary greatly,  variations  should
not be  considered  indicative  of positive or negative  trends to gauge  future
financial  results.  For the years ended  December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002, the
after-tax  effects of yield  maintenance  payments  on net  income  and  diluted
earnings per share were $3.4 million or $0.28 per diluted share, $3.0 million or
$0.25  per  diluted  share  and  $2.1  million  or  $0.17  per  diluted   share,
respectively.  In light of current  expectations  that interest  rates will rise
during 2005,  it should be expected that  prepayments  will be down in the year,
which would result in lower  levels of yield  maintenance  payments  received by
Farmer Mac.

     The following table provides information regarding  interest-earning assets
and funding for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The balance of
non-accruing loans is included in the average balance of interest-earning  loans
presented, though no related income is included in the income figures presented.
Therefore, as the balance of non-accruing loans increases or decreases,  the net
interest yield will increase or decrease  accordingly.  Net interest  income and
the yield will also  fluctuate due to the  uncertainty of the timing and size of
yield  maintenance  payments.  The low  average  rate  earned  on cash  and cash
equivalents  reflects the relatively  low level of short-term  interest rates in
2004 and 2003,  compared to 2002, and an increase in short-term  market rates in
2004 compared to 2003. The decrease in the average rate for investments reflects
the narrower spreads between U.S. Treasury securities and corresponding floating
rate investments acquired and outstanding during 2004, compared to wider spreads
on investments  acquired and  outstanding  during the prior  periods.  The lower
average rate on loans and Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities  reflects the normal
amortization  and  prepayment  of principal  balances of older,  higher-yielding
fixed rate loans.  The  fluctuations  in the average  rate on Farmer Mac's notes
payable  due  within  one year are  consistent  with  general  trends in average
short-term rates during the periods presented. The downward trend in the average
rate on notes  payable  due after one year  reflects  the  retirement  of older,
higher  rate debt,  as well as the  issuance  of new debt at lower rates and the
relative stability of long-term interest rates during 2004.

     The  following  table sets forth  information  regarding the changes in the
components of Farmer Mac's net interest  income for the periods  indicated.  For
each  category,  information is provided on changes  attributable  to changes in
volume (change in volume  multiplied by old rate) and changes in rate (change in
rate  multiplied  by old  volume).  Combined  rate/volume  variances,  the third
element of the  calculation,  are allocated  based on their  relative  size. The
increases due to rate reflect the  short-term or  adjustable-rate  nature of the
assets or  liabilities  and the general  increases  in short term market  rates,
while the  decrease due to rate for loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
reflects the normal  amortization and prepayment of principal  balances of older
higher-yielding fixed rate loans, as described above.

     Guarantee and Commitment Fees.  Guarantee and commitment fee income,  which
compensate  Farmer Mac for assuming the credit risk on loans  underlying  Farmer
Mac Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs,  was $21.0 million for 2004,  compared to
$20.7 million for 2003 and $19.3 million for 2002. The increase in guarantee and
commitment fee income reflects an increase in the average balance of outstanding
guarantees and LTSPCs.  For 2004, the effect of SFAS 140 classified $4.1 million
of guarantee fees received as interest  income,  although  management  considers
that amount to have been earned in  consideration  for the  assumption of credit
risk.  That  portion of the  difference  or "spread"  between the cost of Farmer
Mac's  debt  funding  for loans  and the yield on  post-1996  Act  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed Securities held on its books compensates for credit and interest rate
risk.  When a post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Security is sold to a third
party,  Farmer Mac  continues  to receive the  guarantee  fee  component of that
spread,  which  continues to compensate  Farmer Mac for its assumption of credit
risk.  The portion of the spread that  compensates  for interest rate risk would
not  typically  continue  to be  received  by Farmer Mac if the asset were sold,
except to the extent attributable to any retained interest-only strip.

     Gains and Losses on Financial Derivatives and Trading Assets.  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities  ("SFAS 133")  requires the change in the fair values of
financial  derivatives  to be reflected in a company's net income or accumulated
other comprehensive  income. The net effect of financial derivatives that do not
qualify  for hedge  accounting  under SFAS 133 and  trading  assets  recorded in
Farmer  Mac's  consolidated  statements  of  operations  was a net  gain of $2.8
million  for 2004,  a net gain of $2.4  million  for 2003 and a net loss of $8.4
million for 2002. On a net  after-tax  basis,  those gains and losses,  combined
with the cumulative  effect of the change in accounting  principles and benefits
received from the elimination of the  amortization  of certain premium  payments
that  resulted  from  SFAS  133,   increased  net  income  available  to  common
stockholders by $0.8 million in 2004,  increased net income  available to common
stockholders by $2.0 million for 2003 and reduced net income available to common
stockholders by $1.6 million for 2002.

     Gains on the Sale of Real  Estate  Owned.  Gains on the sale of real estate
owned were $0.5  million,  $0.2  million and $0.1  million for each of the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     Representation  and  Warranty  Claims  Income.   During  2004,  Farmer  Mac
recovered  approximately  $2.8  million  from three  sellers (one of which was a
related party) for breaches of  representations  and warranties  associated with
prior sales of agricultural  mortgage loans to Farmer Mac. During 2003 and 2002,
Farmer Mac had no representation and warranty claims income.

     Other  Income.  Other  income was $1.5  million for 2004,  compared to $0.8
million for 2003 and $1.3 million for 2002.

     Expenses.  During 2003 and 2004,  and into 2005,  Farmer Mac undertook (and
expects to  continue)  several  initiatives  to  validate  and  enhance its risk
management practices, internal controls, and accounting and financial reporting.
These initiatives are the result of ongoing corporate  diligence and a number of
regulatory  considerations,  including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 and FCA  requirements,  as well as the  heightened  focus on the regulatory
environment for GSEs generally.  The general  increases in both compensation and
employee  benefits  and general and  administrative  expenses  from 2002 to 2004
reflect the costs of those initiatives, particularly staffing increases relative
to the internal controls function.  Compensation and employee benefits were $7.0
million,  $6.1 million and $5.1 million for 2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively.
General and  administrative  expenses,  including  consultants'  fees, were $8.8
million,  $6.0 million and $5.5 million for 2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively.
Farmer Mac expects all of the  above-mentioned  expenses to continue at or above
current levels through 2005.

     Regulatory fees were $2.1 million,  $2.0 million and $1.2 million for 2004,
2003 and 2002,  respectively.  FCA has  advised  Farmer  Mac that its  estimated
assessment  for 2005 is $2.3 million.  The regulatory  assessments  from FCA for
each of the examination  periods  corresponding  approximately  with each of the
years ended  December  31, 2004,  2003 and 2002  include  both their  originally
estimated assessments and revisions to those estimates that reflect actual costs
incurred.  These  revisions  have resulted in both  additional  assessments  and
refunds in the past.

     Real estate owned net operating  expenses were $0.3 million for each of the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.  These net costs were negligible for the
year ended December 31, 2002.

     After careful  evaluation of the overall  improved credit quality of Farmer
Mac's portfolio,  the strong U.S.  agricultural economy, the recent upward trend
in agricultural land values and the $345.7 million  year-over-year  reduction in
Farmer Mac's outstanding guarantees and commitments,  Farmer Mac determined that
the appropriate  level of allowance for losses as of December 31, 2004 was $17.1
million,  compared to $22.1 million as of December 31, 2003 and $20.0 million as
of December 31, 2002. As a result of this  determination,  Farmer Mac released a
net $0.4  million  from its  allowance  for  losses in 2004,  compared  to total
provisions  for the  allowance  for losses in 2003 and 2002 of $7.3  million and
$8.2 million, respectively. For 2004, the release of the allowance for losses of
$0.4 million was the net effect of a release of $2.0 million from the  provision
for  losses,  which  is a  component  of  operating  expenses,  and a  partially
offsetting provision for loan losses of $1.6 million,  which was charged against
net interest  income.  The $2.0 million release from the provision for losses in
2004 compares to provisions for losses of $0.8 million and $6.9 million for 2003
and 2002,  respectively.  For  additional  information  regarding  Farmer  Mac's
provisions for losses and  allowances  for losses in the aggregate,  see "--Risk
Management--Credit Risk - Loans."

     Income Tax  Expense.  Income tax  expense  totaled  $14.0  million in 2004,
compared  to $12.3  million  in 2003  and $9.8  million  in 2002.  Farmer  Mac's
effective  tax rates for 2004,  2003 and 2002 were  approximately  31.4 percent,
31.1 percent and 30.1 percent,  respectively.  For more information about income
taxes, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

     Gains and Losses on the  Repurchase of Debt.  During 2004 and 2003,  Farmer
Mac did not  repurchase any of its  outstanding  debt.  During 2002,  Farmer Mac
recognized  $1.4 million of net gains on the repurchase of $103.7 million of its
outstanding  debt. All of the repurchases were from outstanding  Farmer Mac debt
that  had a  maturity  date of  October  14,  2011 and an  interest  rate of 5.4
percent.  Those debt securities were replaced with new fixed-rate funding to the
same maturity dates at more attractive  interest rates,  which preserved  Farmer
Mac's asset-liability match and reduced future interest expense.

     Non-GAAP Performance Measures.  Farmer Mac reports its financial results in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America  ("GAAP").  In addition to GAAP  measures,  Farmer Mac presents  certain
non-GAAP  performance  measures.  Farmer Mac uses the latter measures to develop
financial   plans,  to  gauge   corporate   performance  and  to  set  incentive
compensation   because,   in  management's  view,  the  non-GAAP  measures  more
accurately represent Farmer Mac's economic  performance,  transaction  economics
and  business  trends.  Investors  and the  investment  analyst  community  have
previously  relied upon similar measures to evaluate Farmer Mac's historical and
future performance. Farmer Mac's disclosure of non-GAAP measures is not intended
to replace GAAP information but, rather, to supplement it.

     Farmer Mac developed  non-GAAP core earnings to present net income less the
after-tax effects of SFAS 133 and less the after-tax net gains and losses on the
repurchase  of  debt  that,   prior  to  January  1,  2003,   were  reported  as
extraordinary  items.  Core earnings for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 were $27.4 million, $23.0 million and $22.9 million,  respectively. The
reconciliation  of GAAP net  income  available  to common  stockholders  to core
earnings is presented in the following table:

     Effects of SFAS 133 on Accounting for Callable Interest Rate Swaps.  Farmer
Mac enters into financial  derivative  transactions to protect against risk from
the effects of market price or interest  rate  movements on the value of assets,
future cash flows and debt issuance,  not for trading or  speculative  purposes.
Farmer  Mac  enters   into   interest   rate  swap   contracts   to  adjust  the
characteristics  of its short-term  debt to match more closely the cash flow and
duration  characteristics of its longer-term mortgage and other assets, and also
to adjust the  characteristics  of its long-term  debt to match more closely the
cash  flow  and  duration  characteristics  of its  short-term  assets,  thereby
reducing  interest  rate  risk and also to  derive an  overall  lower  effective
fixed-rate  cost of borrowing than would otherwise be available to Farmer Mac in
the  conventional  debt  market.  Specifically,   interest  rate  swaps  convert
economically  the  variable  cash flows  related to the  forecasted  issuance of
short-term debt to effectively  fixed-rate  medium-term and long-term notes that
match the anticipated  duration,  repricing and interest rate characteristics of
the corresponding  assets. Since this strategy provides Farmer Mac with the same
cash flows as those that are  inherent  in the  issuance of  medium-term  notes,
Farmer  Mac uses  either  the bond  market or the swap  market  based upon their
relative pricing efficiencies.

     Farmer  Mac uses  callable  interest  rate swaps (in  conjunction  with the
issuance of short-term  debt) as an  alternative to callable  medium-term  notes
with equivalently  structured  maturities and call options.  The call options on
the swaps  are  designed  to match  the  implicit  prepayment  options  on those
mortgage  assets without  prepayment  protection.  The blended  durations of the
swaps are also  designed  to match the  duration  of the  mortgages  over  their
estimated  lives.  If the  mortgages  prepay,  the swaps  can be called  and the
short-term  debt  repaid;  if the  mortgages  do not  prepay,  the swaps  remain
outstanding  and the  short-term  debt is  rolled  over,  effectively  providing
fixed-rate callable funding over the lives of the mortgages. Thus, the economics
of the assets are closely matched to the economics of the interest rate swap and
funding combination.

     The callable interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on Farmer Mac's
balance  sheet  with  the  related  changes  in  fair  value  recognized  in the
consolidated  statement of  operations.  Although  Farmer Mac believes that this
strategy  achieves its economic and risk  management  objectives,  the Financial
Accounting  Standards Board has adopted a mixed attribute  accounting  model for
callable swaps that does not reflect the economics of the transactions. Pursuant
to that model, while the issuance of a callable  medium-term note is recorded at
historical  cost, the economic  equivalent (the issuance of short term-debt with
the forecasted rollover of that debt and the simultaneous issuance of a callable
interest rate swap) is recorded  differently (the discount notes are recorded at
historical  cost and the interest rate swap is recorded at fair value).  Despite
the closely  matched  economics and optionality of the assets and the associated
interest rate swap and funding  combination,  the callable  swaps do not qualify
for hedge  accounting  under SFAS 133 because  the test for hedge  effectiveness
under SFAS 133 is based on the linkage between the forecasted short-term funding
and the callable  interest rate swap and ignores the prepayable  characteristics
of the associated assets being funded.

     Business Volume.  Loans are brought into the Farmer Mac I and Farmer Mac II
programs as follows:

     o    Farmer Mac purchases  eligible loans and guarantees timely payments of
          principal and interest of securities  backed by those loans as part of
          the Farmer Mac I program.  Farmer Mac may retain  some or all of those
          securities  in its  portfolio or sell them to third parties in capital
          markets transactions.
     o    Farmer Mac purchases  USDA-guaranteed portions of loans and guarantees
          timely  payments of  principal  and interest of  securities  backed by
          those guaranteed portions as part of the Farmer Mac II program. Farmer
          Mac may retain some or all of those  securities  in its  portfolio  or
          sell them to third parties in capital markets transactions.
     o    Farmer Mac  enters  into  LTSPCs  for  eligible  loans.  Farmer  Mac's
          commitments through LTSPCs include either newly originated or seasoned
          eligible loans, and are part of the Farmer Mac I program.
     o    Farmer Mac exchanges  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  for eligible
          loans or  USDA-guaranteed  portions  of loans.  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
          Securities exchanged for USDA-guaranteed portions of loans are part of
          the Farmer Mac II program;  Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities exchanged
          for any other eligible loans are part of the Farmer Mac I program.

     During  2004,  the volume of loans  purchased  or placed  under  Farmer Mac
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  totaled $0.7  billion,  a decrease from 2003
volume of $1.2 billion.  That decrease was  attributable  to a decrease of $88.2
million in Farmer Mac I Loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  volume,  a
decrease of $370.8  million in LTSPC volume,  and a decrease of $97.2 million in
Farmer Mac II volume in 2004. See  "Business--Farmer  Mac  Programs--Farmer  Mac
I--Off-Balance Sheet Guarantees and Commitments" and Note 12 to the consolidated
financial statements for a description of LTSPCs. The following table sets forth
information  regarding the volume of loans  purchased or placed under Farmer Mac
Guaranteed Securities or LTSPCs for the periods indicated:

     The purchase  price of newly  originated  and seasoned  eligible  loans and
portfolios,  none of which are  delinquent at the time of purchase,  is the fair
value based on current market  interest rates and Farmer Mac's target net yield,
which  includes  an amount to  compensate  Farmer  Mac for  credit  risk that is
similar to the guarantee or commitment fee it receives for accepting credit risk
on loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.
The purchase price for loans purchased from all related parties is determined in
the same manner as for loans acquired from any other third party.  See Note 3 to
the  consolidated  financial  statements  for a  description  of  related  party
transactions.

     As part of fulfilling its guarantee obligations for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities and commitments to purchase eligible loans underlying LTSPCs,  Farmer
Mac purchases  defaulted  loans, all of which are at least 90 days delinquent at
the time of purchase,  out of those securities and pools. The purchase price for
defaulted  loans  purchased  out of Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  is the
current  outstanding  principal  balance  of the loan plus  accrued  and  unpaid
interest. The purchase price for defaulted loans purchased under an LTSPC is the
then-current  outstanding principal balance of the loan, with accrued and unpaid
interest on the  defaulted  loans  payable  out of any future  loan  payments or
liquidation proceeds as received.  The purchase price of a defaulted loan is not
an  indicator  of the  expected  loss on that loan;  many other  factors  affect
expected  loss,  if any, on loans so purchased.  See "--Risk  Management--Credit
Risk - Loans."


     The following table presents Farmer Mac's purchases of newly originated and
current seasoned loans and purchases of defaulted loans underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

</TABLE>

     The decrease in newly  originated  and current  seasoned loan purchases was
attributable to a decrease in program  volume.  The purchases of defaulted loans
from Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs are pursuant to Farmer Mac's
obligations as guarantor and under its  contractual  commitments,  respectively.
Farmer  Mac  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  repurchase  the  defaulted  loans
underlying  Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities and is obligated to purchase those
underlying an LTSPC. With respect to the transfer of loans from on-balance sheet
Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities to loans, when particular  criteria are met,
such as the default of the borrower, Farmer Mac becomes entitled to purchase the
defaulted loans underlying Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities (commonly referred
to as  "removal-of-account"  provisions).  Farmer Mac records all such defaulted
loans at their value during the period in which  Farmer Mac becomes  entitled to
repurchase  the  loans  and  therefore   regains   effective  control  over  the
transferred  loans.  Fair  value is  determined  by  appraisal  or  management's
estimate of discounted collateral value. Farmer Mac records, at acquisition, the
difference between each loan's acquisition cost and its fair value, if any, as a
charge to the reserve for losses.

     The  weighted-average  age of the Farmer Mac I newly originated and current
seasoned  loans  purchased  during both 2004 and 2003 was less than one year. Of
the combined total of Farmer Mac I newly originated and seasoned loans that were
purchased  (excluding  purchases of defaulted  loans)  during 2004 and 2003,  64
percent and 74 percent,  respectively, had principal amortization periods longer
than the  maturity  date,  resulting  in balloon  payments at  maturity,  with a
weighted-average   remaining   term  to   maturity   of  17.5  and  15.2  years,
respectively.  The  weighted-average  age of delinquent  loans  purchased out of
securitized  pools and LTSPCs  during 2004 and 2003 was 6.1 years and 4.7 years,
respectively.

     The outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying LTSPCs
and on- and  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities  decreased six
percent to $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2004 from $5.8 billion as of December
31, 2003. The following table sets forth information regarding those outstanding
balances as of the dates indicated:

</TABLE>

     Based  on  market  conditions,  Farmer  Mac  either  retains  the  loans it
purchases or  securitizes  them and issues  Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities
backed by those loans.  During 2004 and 2003,  Farmer Mac  securitized  and sold
$91.4 million and $78.3 million,  respectively ($64.5 million and $75.8 million,
respectively,  of such  securities  were sold to a related  party,  Zions  First
National Bank), of the loans purchased, and during 2003 issued $722.3 million in
the form of a swap  transaction  with a related party  participant,  Farm Credit
West,  ACA.  This  transaction  resulted  from the  participant's  exercise of a
conversion feature incorporated in all existing LTSPCs. Farmer Mac's decision to
retain the remainder of the loans it purchased was based on favorable underlying
funding costs that resulted in attractive net interest  income over the lives of
the loans and Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities it holds.

     LTSPCs typically involve seasoned loans,  while cash purchase  transactions
usually  represent  acquisitions of newly originated  loans. The decreased LTSPC
activity  in 2004 was a  result  of  reduced  growth  rates in the  agricultural
mortgage  market,  which  have  tended to be a  function  of the  interest  rate
environment and other factors  described two paragraphs  below.  With particular
regard to FCS  institutions,  some business  prospects have been  constrained by
increased FCSIC insurance premiums assessed on loans held by those institutions,
including loans under LTSPCs. In addition, FCSIC has recently indicated to those
institutions  that they should be cautious about the risk of doing business with
GSEs,  including  Farmer  Mac,  as  counterparties.  Moreover,  FCSIC has raised
objections to FCS institutions'  use of Farmer Mac swaps,  which generate Farmer
Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  that are not subject to the  previously  mentioned
insurance premiums.  Notwithstanding  this,  management expects that LTSPCs will
continue  to  constitute  a  significant  portion  of new  Farmer  Mac I program
activity during 2005.

     Indicators of future loan purchase and guarantee volume  (excluding  LTSPC,
swap or  portfolio  purchase  volume) in the  immediately  succeeding  reporting
period  include  outstanding  commitments  to purchase  loans  (other than under
LTSPCs) and the total  balance of loans  submitted  for approval or approved but
not yet  purchased.  Many  purchase  commitments  entered into by Farmer Mac are
mandatory delivery  commitments.  If a seller obtains a mandatory commitment and
is unable to deliver the loans required, Farmer Mac requires the seller to pay a
fee to  modify,  extend or cancel  the  commitment.  As of  December  31,  2004,
outstanding  commitments  to  purchase  Farmer  Mac I loans  and  Farmer  Mac II
guaranteed  portions  totaled  $13.0  million,  compared to $11.2  million as of
December 31, 2003. All of those  commitments were mandatory  commitments.  Loans
submitted  for  approval or approved but not yet  committed to purchase  totaled
$19.2 million as of December 31, 2004,  compared to $26.6 million as of December
31,  2003.  Not all of such loans are  purchased,  as some are denied for credit
reasons or withdrawn by the seller.

     New business volume  decreased  during 2004 compared to 2003.  Factors that
significantly lowered Farmer Mac's 2004 new business volume compared to previous
years included:

     o    reduced growth rates in the agricultural  mortgage market, due largely
          to the increased liquidity of agricultural borrowers;
     o    increased available capital and liquidity of agricultural lenders;
     o    new  alternative   sources  of  funding  and  credit  enhancement  for
          agricultural lenders;
     o    increased competition in the secondary market for purchases of quality
          agricultural mortgage loans;
     o    adverse publicity about and increased regulatory pressure on GSEs; and
     o    uncertainty   created  by  the  proposed  FCA  regulation   concerning
          risk-weighting of assets held by FCS institutions which, if adopted in
          its current  form,  could  decrease the value of LTSPCs and Farmer Mac
          swaps to those institutions (See "- Regulatory Matters").

     During  2004,  Farmer Mac was not able to  replicate  recent  prior  years'
volume growth in Farmer Mac I and II individual loan purchases, nor in additions
to existing  LTSPC  arrangements.  However,  Farmer Mac believes  its  marketing
initiatives  are  generating   business   opportunities  for  2005  and  beyond.
Initiatives currently underway include:

     o    new  and  expanded  business  relationships,   including  a  strategic
          alliance with a related party Farm Credit System institution that will
          serve a  cross-section  of  agricultural  lenders in many areas of the
          nation;
     o    product enhancements,  such as new open prepayment loan structures;
     o    agribusiness and rural  development loans associated with agriculture,
          in fulfillment of its Congressional mission;
     o    federal and state agricultural finance programs; and
     o    new loan securitization structures.

     Some of the  agribusiness  and rural  development  initiatives will require
Farmer Mac to  consider  credit  risks that expand upon or differ from those the
Corporation has accepted previously.  Farmer Mac will use underwriting standards
appropriate to those credit risks,  and likely will draw upon outside  expertise
to  analyze  and  evaluate  the credit and  funding  aspects of loans  submitted
pursuant to those  initiatives.  While Farmer Mac is seeking  actively to expand
its mix of loan types within the scope of its Congressional  charter,  investors
are cautioned that it is too early to assess the probability of success of these
efforts.  Farmer Mac believes that prospects for larger  portfolio  transactions
similar  to those that have  accounted  for a  significant  portion of growth in
prior years continue to exist, but, in light of market conditions,  no assurance
can be given at this time as to the certainty or timing of such transactions.

programs,   see  "Business--Farmer  Mac  Programs--Farmer  Mac  I--Sellers"  and
"--Farmer Mac  II--United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  Guaranteed  Loan
Programs."

     Related Party Transactions. In 2004 and 2003, Farmer Mac conducted business
with entities that are related  parties as a result of either a member of Farmer
Mac's board of directors  being  affiliated  with the entity in some capacity or
the entity  being the holder of at least 10 percent of a class of voting  common
stock.  These  transactions  were conducted in the ordinary  course of business,
with terms and  conditions  comparable  to those  available  to any other  third
party. For more information about related party transactions,  see Note 3 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Balance Sheet Review

     Assets. As of December 31, 2004, total assets were $3.8 billion compared to
$4.3 billion as of December 31, 2003.  On-balance  sheet program  assets (Farmer
Mac Guaranteed Securities and loans),  decreased $232.0 million during 2004 to a
total of $2.2 billion, while non-program assets decreased $220.8 million to $1.6
billion as of December 31,  2004.  The  following  table  presents  Farmer Mac's

</TABLE>

     Liabilities. Total liabilities decreased to $3.6 billion as of December 31,
2004 from $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2003. The decrease in liabilities  was
due  primarily  to a  reduction  in notes  payable,  which  corresponded  to the
reduction of on-balance sheet assets.  For more  information  about Farmer Mac's
funding and interest rate risk practices and how financial derivatives are used,
see "--Risk  Management--Interest  Rate Risk." For more information about Farmer
Mac's reserve for losses, see "--Risk Management--Credit Risk - Loans."

     Capital.  As of December  31, 2004,  stockholders'  equity  totaled  $236.9
million,  compared to $213.3  million as of December 31, 2003.  The increase was
primarily due to net income  available to common  stockholders  of $28.2 million
earned  during  2004.  Additionally,  there was a $1.4  million net  increase in
accumulated other comprehensive  income/(loss)  resulting from a net increase of
$11.1 million in the market values of financial  derivatives  classified as cash
flow hedges and a decrease of $9.7 million in net unrealized gains on investment
securities  and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  classified  as available for
sale.  Farmer Mac's return on average  common  equity was 14.9 percent for 2004,
compared to 15.3 percent for 2003 and 15.0 percent for 2002.  Accumulated  other
comprehensive  income  is not a  component  of  Farmer  Mac's  core  capital  or
regulatory capital.

     Farmer Mac is  required  to hold  capital  at the  higher of its  statutory
minimum  capital  requirement or the amount  required by its risk-based  capital
stress test. As of December 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac's core capital  totaled $237.7
million and exceeded its statutory minimum capital requirement of $128.9 million
by $108.8  million.  As of December  31, 2004 Farmer  Mac's  risk-based  capital
stress test generated a regulatory capital requirement of $37.1 million.  Farmer
Mac's regulatory capital of $254.8 million exceeded that amount by approximately
$217.7  million.   For  further   information,   see  "--Liquidity  and  Capital
Resources--Capital Requirements."

     Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs.  Farmer Mac
offers  approved   agricultural  and  rural  residential  mortgage  lenders  two
alternatives to increase their liquidity or lending capacity while retaining the
cash flow benefits of their loans: (1) Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities,  which
are  available  through  either  the  Farmer  Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II
program,  and (2)  LTSPCs,  which are  available  only  through the Farmer Mac I
program. Both of these alternatives result in off-balance sheet transactions for
Farmer Mac.

     To be eligible for the Farmer Mac I program,  a loan must meet Farmer Mac's
credit underwriting,  appraisal and documentation standards. Accordingly, Farmer
Mac  believes  the credit risk it assumes for Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
backed by loans that are eligible for the Farmer Mac I program and for LTSPCs is
the same and considers the effects of all on- and off-balance  sheet  activities
on its overall portfolio  diversification and credit risk. See Note 12 to Farmer
Mac's  consolidated  financial  statements for more detail on the  Corporation's
off-balance sheet program activities.

     As  of  December  31,  2004,  outstanding   off-balance  sheet  Farmer  Mac
Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs totaled $3.2 billion,  compared to $3.4 billion
as of December 31, 2003. The following table presents the balance of outstanding
LTSPCs and off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities as of December 31,

Risk Management

     Interest  Rate Risk.  Farmer Mac is  subject to  interest  rate risk on all
assets held for investment  because of possible  timing  differences in the cash
flows of the assets and related  liabilities.  This risk is primarily related to
loans held and on-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities because of the
ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled  maturities,
thereby  increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow  mismatches.  Cash
flow mismatches in a changing  interest rate environment can reduce the earnings
of the  Corporation  if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash
flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments when Farmer Mac's funding
costs  cannot be  correspondingly  reduced,  or if assets repay more slowly than
expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher-cost debt.


     Yield maintenance  provisions and other prepayment  penalties  contained in
many agricultural mortgage loans reduce, but do not eliminate,  prepayment risk,
particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield  maintenance may not be
collected. Those provisions require borrowers to make an additional payment when
they prepay their loans so that,  when  reinvested  with the prepaid  principal,
yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows that would
have  been  generated  had the  loan  not  prepaid.  Those  provisions  create a
disincentive  to prepayment and compensate the Corporation for its interest rate
risks to a large degree.  As of December 31, 2004, 58 percent of the outstanding
balance of all loans held and loans  underlying  on-balance  sheet  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  (including  94 percent of all loans with fixed  interest
rates)  were  covered  by yield  maintenance  provisions  and  other  prepayment
penalties.  As of December 31, 2004, 52 percent of the total outstanding balance
of retained Farmer Mac I loans and Guaranteed  Securities had yield  maintenance
provisions and 6 percent had other forms of prepayment protection. Of the Farmer
Mac I new and current loans  purchased in 2004, 8 percent had yield  maintenance
or another form of prepayment protection (including 25 percent of all loans with
fixed  interest  rates).  As of December 31, 2004,  none of the  USDA-guaranteed
portions  underlying  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities had yield maintenance
provisions;   however,  13  percent  contained  prepayment  penalties.   Of  the
USDA-guaranteed  portions  purchased in 2004,  25 percent  contained  prepayment
penalties.

     Taking  into  consideration  the  prepayment  provisions  and  the  default
probabilities  associated with its mortgage  assets,  Farmer Mac uses prepayment
models to project and value cash flows  associated  with these  assets.  Because
borrowers'  behavior in various interest rate environments may change over time,
Farmer Mac periodically  evaluates the effectiveness of these models compared to
actual prepayment  experience and adjusts and refines the models as necessary to
improve the precision of subsequent  prepayment forecasts.  In addition,  Farmer
Mac consults with independent prepayment experts as part of the model evaluation
process.

     The goal of interest  rate risk  management  at Farmer Mac is to create and
maintain a portfolio that generates  stable  earnings and value across a variety
of interest  rate  environments.  Farmer  Mac's  primary  strategy  for managing
interest rate risk is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar
durations  so that they will  perform  similarly as interest  rates  change.  To
achieve  this match,  Farmer Mac issues  discount  notes and both  callable  and
non-callable  medium-term  notes  across a spectrum  of  maturities.  Farmer Mac
issues callable debt to offset the prepayment risk associated with some mortgage
assets.  By  using a blend of  liabilities  that  includes  callable  debt,  the
interest rate  sensitivities  of the liabilities tend to increase or decrease as
interest  rates  change in a manner  similar  to changes  in the  interest  rate
sensitivities of the assets. Farmer Mac also uses financial derivatives to alter
the  duration of its assets and  liabilities  to better  match their  durations,
thereby reducing overall interest rate sensitivity.

     Farmer Mac's $430.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31,
2004 matures within three months and is match-funded  with discount notes having
similar maturities.  As of December 31, 2004, $823.4 million of the $1.1 billion
of investment securities (78.0 percent) were floating rate securities with rates
that adjust within one year. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements
for more information on investment  securities.  These floating rate investments
are funded using:

     o    a series of discount note issuances in which each successive  discount
          note is issued  and  matures on or about the  corresponding  repricing
          date of the related investment;
     o    floating-rate  notes  having  similar  rate  reset  provisions  as the
          related investment; or
     o    fixed-rate  notes  swapped to  floating  rates  having  similar  reset
          provisions as the related investment.

     Farmer Mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans,  including loans
that Farmer Mac has committed to acquire (other than through LTSPCs) but has not
yet purchased.  When Farmer Mac commits to purchase such loans, it is exposed to
interest  rate risk  between the time it commits to  purchase  the loans and the
time it either:

     o    sells Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities backed by the loans; or
     o    issues  debt to retain the loans in its  portfolio  (although  issuing
          debt to fund  the  loans  as  investments  does  not  fully  eliminate
          interest rate risk due to the possible timing  differences in the cash
          flows of the assets and related liabilities, as discussed above).

Farmer Mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans, and any related
Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities or debt  issuance,  through the use of forward
sale  contracts  on the debt and  mortgage-backed  securities  of other GSEs and
futures contracts  involving U.S. Treasury  securities.  Farmer Mac uses forward
sale contracts on GSE securities to reduce its interest rate exposure to changes
in both  Treasury  rates  and  spreads  on  Farmer  Mac  debt and  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed Securities.


     Recognizing  that interest rate  sensitivity may change with the passage of
time and as  interest  rates  change,  Farmer Mac  assesses  this  exposure on a
regular  basis  and,  if  necessary,  readjusts  its  portfolio  of  assets  and
liabilities by:

     o    purchasing mortgage assets in the ordinary course of business;
     o    refunding existing liabilities; or
     o    using derivatives to alter the  characteristics  of existing assets or
          liabilities.

     The most  comprehensive  stress test of Farmer Mac's  exposure to long-term
interest rate risk is the  measurement of the sensitivity of its Market Value of
Equity  ("MVE") to yield curve shocks.  MVE  represents the present value of all
future  cash  flows  from on- and  off-balance  sheet  assets,  liabilities  and
financial  derivatives,  discounted at current  interest rates and spreads.  The
following  schedule  summarizes  the  results  of Farmer  Mac's MVE  sensitivity
analysis  as of December  31, 2004 and  December  31, 2003 to an  immediate  and
instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve.

</TABLE>

As  measured  by  this  MVE  analysis,  Farmer  Mac's  long-term  interest  rate
sensitivity  increased  somewhat  during 2004,  but remained at  relatively  low
levels  despite  the  significant  change in the slope of the yield  curve  that
occurred  during the year.  Farmer  Mac's  effective  duration  gap was plus 0.4
months as of December 31, 2004,  compared to minus 0.1 months as of December 31,
2003.

     As of December  31,  2004,  a uniform or  "parallel"  increase of 100 basis
points would have increased net interest income ("NII") by 9.2 percent,  while a
parallel  decrease of 100 basis points would have  decreased NII by 7.7 percent.
Farmer Mac also  measures  the  sensitivity  of both MVE and NII to a variety of
non-parallel  interest rate shocks,  including  flattening and steepening  yield
curve  scenarios.  As of  December  31,  2004,  both MVE and NII showed  similar
sensitivity to non-parallel shocks as to the parallel shocks. The sensitivity of
Farmer Mac's MVE and NII to both parallel and non-parallel interest rate shocks,
and its duration gap,  indicate the  effectiveness  of Farmer Mac's  approach to
managing its interest rate risk exposures.


     The economic  effects of financial  derivatives,  including  interest  rate
swaps,  are  included in the MVE,  NII and  duration  gap  analyses.  Farmer Mac
generally  enters into various  interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk
as follows:

     o    "floating-to-fixed  interest  rate swaps" in which it pays fixed rates
          of  interest  to,  and  receives  floating  rates  of  interest  from,
          counterparties;  these swaps adjust the  characteristics of short-term
          debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics
          of longer-term reset and fixed-rate mortgages and other assets and may
          provide  an  overall  lower  effective  cost of  borrowing  than would
          otherwise be available in the conventional debt market;
     o    "fixed-to-floating  interest  rate swaps" in which it  receives  fixed
          rates of  interest  from,  and pays  floating  rates of  interest  to,
          counterparties;  these  transactions  adjust  the  characteristics  of
          long-term  debt to  match  more  closely  the cash  flow and  duration
          characteristics of short-term or floating-rate assets; and
     o    "basis swaps" in which it pays variable rates of interest based on one
          index to, and  receives  variable  rates of interest  based on another
          index from, counterparties; these swaps alter interest rate indices of
          liabilities to match those of assets, and vice versa.

As of December 31, 2004, Farmer Mac had $1.5 billion combined notional amount of
interest  rate swaps,  with terms  ranging from one to fifteen  years,  of which
$639.5 million were  floating-to-fixed  interest rate swaps, $651.7 million were
basis swaps and $205.0 million were fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps.

     Farmer Mac uses financial  derivatives as an end-user for hedging purposes,
not for trading or speculative  purposes.  When financial  derivatives  meet the
specific  hedge  criteria  under SFAS 133, they are accounted for as either fair
value  hedges or cash flow  hedges.  Financial  derivatives  that do not satisfy
those hedge  criteria  are not  accounted  for as hedges and changes in the fair
value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial
derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statement of operations.  All
of Farmer Mac's financial  derivative  transactions are conducted under standard
collateralized  agreements that limit Farmer Mac's potential  credit exposure to
any counterparty.  As of December 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac had no  uncollateralized
net exposure to any counterparty.

     Credit Risk - Loans.  Farmer Mac's  primary  exposure to credit risk is the
risk of loss resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their  mortgages
in conjunction with a deficiency in the value of the collateral  relative to the
amount  outstanding on the mortgage and the cost of  liquidation.  Farmer Mac is
exposed  to credit  risk on:

     o    loans it holds;
     o    loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities; and
     o    loans underlying LTSPCs.

Loans held or loans underlying Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities or LTSPCs can be
divided into four groups:

     o    loans held for investment;
     o    loans underlying pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities;
     o    loans underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities or
          LTSPCs; and
     o    USDA-guaranteed   portions   underlying   Farmer  Mac  II   Guaranteed
          Securities.

     For loans underlying pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities,  ten
percent  first-loss  subordinated  interests  mitigate  Farmer Mac's credit risk
exposure.  Before  Farmer Mac incurs a credit loss,  full recourse must first be
taken  against  the   subordinated   interest.   The  1996  Act  eliminated  the
subordinated interest requirement. As a result, Farmer Mac generally assumes 100
percent of the credit  risk on loans held for  investment  and loans  underlying
post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs. Farmer Mac's credit
exposure on USDA-guaranteed  portions is covered by the full faith and credit of
the United States.  Farmer Mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure
to loans underlying  pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities because of
the subordinated interests,  or to USDA-guaranteed  portions because of the USDA
guarantee.  The outstanding  principal  balance of loans held, real estate owned
and loans  underlying  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  (including  AgVantage
bonds) or LTSPCs is summarized in the following table.

     Farmer Mac conducts  guarantee  fee adequacy  analyses,  using  stress-test
models developed  internally and with the assistance of outside  experts.  These
analyses have taken into account the diverse and dissimilar  characteristics  of
the various asset  categories  for which Farmer Mac manages its risk  exposures,
and have evolved as the mix and character of assets under management has shifted
with growth in the business and the addition of new asset  categories.  Based on
current  information,  Farmer Mac believes  that its  guarantee  fee is adequate
compensation for the credit risk that it assumes.

     Farmer  Mac  has  established  underwriting,  appraisal  and  documentation
standards  for  agricultural  mortgage  loans to mitigate  the risk of loss from
borrower   defaults  and  to  provide   guidance   concerning  the   management,
administration  and conduct of underwriting and appraisals to all  participating
sellers and potential sellers in its programs. These standards were developed on
the basis of industry norms for agricultural  mortgage loans and are designed to
assess  the  creditworthiness  of the  borrower,  as  well as the  value  of the
collateral   securing   the  loan.   Farmer   Mac   requires   sellers  to  make
representations  and warranties  regarding the  conformity of eligible  mortgage
loans to these  standards,  the accuracy of loan data provided to Farmer Mac and
other requirements  related to the loans.  Sellers are responsible to Farmer Mac
for breaches of those  representations  and  warranties  that result in economic
losses  to the  Corporation.  Pursuant  to  contracts  with  Farmer  Mac  and in
consideration for underwriting and servicing fees, Farmer  Mac-approved  central
servicers  underwrite  mortgage  loans for Farmer Mac in  accordance  with those
standards and other  requirements,  and service  those loans in accordance  with
Farmer Mac  requirements.  Central  servicers are  responsible to Farmer Mac for
serious  errors in the  underwriting  and  servicing  of those  mortgage  loans.
Detailed information regarding Farmer Mac's underwriting and appraisal standards
and seller  eligibility  requirements  are  presented in  "Business--Farmer  Mac
Programs--Farmer    Mac   I--Underwriting    and   Appraisal    Standards"   and
"Business--Farmer Mac Programs--Farmer Mac I--Sellers."

     Farmer Mac  maintains an allowance for losses to cover  estimated  probable
losses on loans held for  investment,  real  estate  owned and loans  underlying
post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs in accordance  with
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies
("SFAS 5") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 114, Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended ("SFAS 114"). The methodology for
determining  the allowance for losses is the same for loans held for  investment
and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs
because Farmer Mac believes the ultimate credit risk is substantially  the same,
i.e.,  the  underlying  agricultural  mortgage  loans  all meet the same  credit
underwriting  and  appraisal  standards.  For accepting the credit risk on loans
underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs,  Farmer
Mac receives guarantee fees and commitment fees,  respectively.  For loans held,
Farmer Mac receives interest income that includes a component that correlates to
its guarantee fee, which Farmer Mac views as compensation  for accepting  credit
risk.

     No  allowance  for losses has been made for loans  underlying  Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first-loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States.  As of December 31, 2004, Farmer
Mac had experienced no credit losses on any pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.


     Farmer Mac's  allowance  for losses is presented in four  components on its
consolidated balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned, net of valuation allowance";
     o    a  "Contingent  obligation  for probable  losses" on loans  underlying
          post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  entered
          into or modified  after  January 1, 2003,  for which  inherent  losses
          existed  at the  time of the  guarantee  or  commitment  and  could be
          reasonably estimated, is included in the balance sheet as a portion of
          the amount reported as "Guarantee and commitment obligation"; and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance
          sheet under "Reserve for losses."

     Farmer Mac's  provision  for losses is presented in two  components  on its
consolidated statement of operations:

     o    a "Provision for loan losses," which represents losses on Farmer Mac's
          loans held for investment; and
     o    a "Provision for losses," which represents  losses on loans underlying
          post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs and real
          estate owned.

     Farmer Mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins
with  management's  evaluation  of the  results  of its  proprietary  loan  pool
simulation  and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon
historical  information from a data set of agricultural  mortgage loans recorded
over a longer period of time than Farmer Mac's own experience to date,  screened
to include  only those  loans with  credit  characteristics  similar to those on
which Farmer Mac has assumed credit risk. The results generated by the Model are
modified by the  application of management's  judgment,  as required to take key
factors into account, including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural commodity/product concentrations in Farmer
          Mac's portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

     Management  believes that its use of this  methodology  produces a reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's portfolio,  including loans held, real estate owned and
loans  underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs.
Farmer Mac's  methodology  for determining its allowance for losses will migrate
over time away from the Model,  to become based on Farmer  Mac's own  historical
portfolio loss experience.  Until that time, Farmer Mac will continue to use the
results from the Model,  augmented by the application of management's  judgment,
to determine its allowance for losses.

     In  addition,   Farmer  Mac   specifically   analyzes   its   portfolio  of
non-performing  assets  (loans  90  days  or  more  past  due,  in  foreclosure,
restructured,  in  bankruptcy,  including  loans  performing  under either their
original loan terms or a court-approved  bankruptcy plan, and real estate owned)
on a loan-by-loan  basis.  This analysis  measures  impairment based on the fair
value of the  underlying  collateral  for each  individual  loan relative to the
total recorded investment, including principal, interest and advances under SFAS
114.  In the event  that the  updated  appraisal  or  management's  estimate  of
discounted  collateral value does not support the total  investment,  Farmer Mac
specifically  allocates an allowance for the loan for the difference between the
recorded  investment and its fair value,  less estimated  costs to liquidate the
collateral.

     For this  analysis and the  allocation of specific  allowances,  Farmer Mac
reviews:

     o    non-performing assets (loans 90 days or more past due, in foreclosure,
          restructured,  in bankruptcy - including loans performing under either
          their original loan terms or a  court-approved  bankruptcy  plan - and
          real estate owned);
     o    loans for which  Farmer  Mac had  adjusted  the  timing of  borrowers'
          payment  schedules,  but still  expects to collect all amounts due and
          has not made economic concessions; and
     o    additional  performing  loans that have  previously been delinquent or
          are secured by real estate that produces  agricultural  commodities or
          products currently under stress.


     Management  believes that the general  allowance,  which is the  difference
between the total allowance for losses (generated  through use of the Model) and
the specific  allowances,  adequately covers any probable losses inherent in the
portfolio of performing loans under SFAS 5.

     Farmer  Mac  believes  that the  methodology  described  above  produces  a
reliable  estimate  of the  total  probable  losses  inherent  in  Farmer  Mac's
portfolio. The Model:

     o    uses  historical   agricultural   real  estate  loan  origination  and
          servicing  data that reflect  varied  economic  conditions  and stress
          levels in the agricultural sector;
     o    contains  features that allow variations for changes in loan portfolio
          characteristics  to make the data set more  representative  of  Farmer
          Mac's portfolio and credit underwriting standards; and
     o    considers  the effects of the ageing of the loan  portfolio  along the
          expected loss curves  associated  with individual  origination  years,
          including  the segments  that are entering into or coming out of their
          peak default years.

     Farmer Mac  analyzes  various  iterations  of the Model data and  considers
various  configurations of loan types,  terms,  economic conditions and borrower
eligibility  criteria to generate a distribution of loss exposures over time for
all loans in the  portfolio,  all to evaluate its overall  allowance for losses,
and back tests the results to validate  the Model.  Such tests use prior  period
data  to  project  losses  expected  in  a  current  period  and  compare  those
projections to actual losses incurred during the current period.

     The allowance for losses is increased through periodic  provisions for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
charged to operating  expense and reduced by charge-offs for actual losses,  net
of recoveries.  Negative provisions for loan losses or provisions for losses are
recorded in the event that the  estimate  of probable  losses as of the end of a
period is lower than the estimate at the  beginning  of the period.  Charge-offs
represent losses on the outstanding  principal  balance,  any interest  payments
previously   accrued  or  advanced  and  expected  costs  of  liquidation.   The
establishment  of and periodic  adjustments to the valuation  allowance for real
estate owned are charged against income as a portion of the provision for losses
charged to operating expense.  Gains and losses on the sale of real estate owned
are recorded in income based on the difference  between the recorded  investment
at the time of sale and liquidation proceeds.


     The  following  table  summarizes  the changes in the  components of Farmer
Mac's allowance for losses for each year in the three-year period ended December

</TABLE>

     Farmer Mac released $0.4 million from the allowance for losses during 2004,
compared to provisions for losses of $7.3 million in 2003.  During 2004,  Farmer
Mac recorded net charge-offs of $4.5 million in losses against the allowance for
losses, compared to net charge-offs of $5.2 million in 2003. The net charge-offs
for 2004 did not include any amounts  related to previously  accrued or advanced
interest  on loans or  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities,  compared  to $0.1
million for 2003.  Additionally,  Farmer Mac recorded  gains on the sale of real
estate owned in 2004 and 2003 of $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively.


     As of December 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac's  allowance for losses  totaled $17.1
million,  or 37 basis points of the outstanding  principal balance of loans held
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs, compared to $22.1 million (44 basis points) as of December 31, 2003. The
year-to-year  decrease in this ratio is a result of the overall  improved credit
quality of the Farmer Mac portfolio,  the strong U.S.  agricultural economy, the
recent  upward  trend  in  agricultural  land  values  and  the  $345.7  million
year-over-year reduction in Farmer Mac's outstanding guarantees and commitments.

     As of December 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac's 90-day  delinquencies  totaled $25.3
million and represented 0.55 percent of the principal  balance of all loans held
and loans  underlying  post-1996  Act Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and
LTSPCs,  compared to $30.1 million (0.60 percent) as of December 31, 2003.  From
quarter  to  quarter,  Farmer Mac  anticipates  the  90-day  delinquencies  will
fluctuate,  both in dollars and as a percentage  of the  outstanding  portfolio,
with  higher  levels  likely at the end of the first and third  quarters of each
year  corresponding  to the  semi-annual  (January  1st and  July  1st)  payment
characteristics  of most Farmer Mac I loans. As of December 31, 2004, loans held
and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs
that  were  90 days  or  more  past  due,  in  foreclosure,  restructured  after
delinquency,  in  bankruptcy  (including  loans  performing  under  either their
original loan terms or a  court-approved  bankruptcy plan) and real estate owned
("post-1996 Act  non-performing  assets")  totaled $50.6 million and represented
1.09  percent of the  principal  balance of all loans held and loans  underlying
post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs,  compared to $70.0
million  (1.39  percent)  as  of  December  31,  2003.   Loans  that  have  been
restructured  after  delinquency were  insignificant and are included within the
reported 90-day delinquency and non-performing asset disclosures.

</TABLE>

     The dollar level of 90-day delinquencies and period-over-period charge-offs
correlates to the proportion of Farmer Mac's portfolio of loans,  guarantees and
commitments  entering their peak  delinquency  and default years  (approximately
years  three  through  five  after  origination).   As  of  December  31,  2004,
approximately  $1.4 billion (31 percent) of Farmer Mac's  outstanding loans held
and loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs
were in their peak  delinquency and default years,  compared to $1.7 billion (34
percent) of such loans as of December  31, 2003.  The Model takes the  portfolio
age distribution and maturation into  consideration.  Accordingly,  those trends
did not cause management to alter the Model's  projection for the provisions for
losses.

     As of December 31, 2004, Farmer Mac analyzed the following three categories
of assets for impairment, based on the fair value of the underlying collateral:

     o    $50.6 million of non-performing assets;
     o    $32.3 million of loans for which Farmer Mac has adjusted the timing of
          borrowers'  payment  schedules  within the past three years, but still
          expects  to  collect  all  amounts  due  and  has  not  made  economic
          concessions; and
     o    $56.6 million of performing loans that have been previously delinquent
          or are secured by real estate that produces  agricultural  commodities
          or products currently under stress.


Those  individual  assessments  covered  a total of  $139.5  million  of  assets
measured  for  impairment  against  updated  appraised  values,   other  updated
collateral  valuations or  discounted  values.  Of the $139.5  million of assets
analyzed,  $126.7 million were adequately  collateralized.  For assets that were
not adequately  collateralized,  individual  collateral  shortfalls totaled $1.4
million.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac allocated specific allowances of $1.4 million
to those under-collateralized assets as of December 31, 2004. As of December 31,
2004, after the allocation of specific allowances to under-collateralized loans,
Farmer Mac had additional  non-specific or general  allowances of $15.7 million,
bringing the total  allowance for losses to $17.1 million.  The following  table
summarizes  Farmer Mac's assets  specifically  reviewed for  impairment  and its
specific allowance for losses:

</TABLE>

Based on Farmer Mac's  loan-by-loan  analyses,  loan  collection  experience and
continuing  provisions  for the allowance  for losses,  Farmer Mac believes that
ongoing losses will be covered adequately by the allowance for losses.

     Original  loan-to-value  ratios  (calculated by dividing the loan principal
balance at the time of guarantee,  purchase or commitment by the appraised value
at the date of loan origination or, when available,  updated  appraised value at
the time of guarantee,  purchase or  commitment)  are one of many factors Farmer
Mac considers in evaluating loss severity.  Other factors  include,  but are not
limited to, other  underwriting  standards,  commodity and farming forecasts and
regional economic and agricultural conditions. Loans in the Farmer Mac I program
are all first mortgage agricultural real estate loans. Accordingly, Farmer Mac's
exposure on a loan is limited to the difference between the total of the accrued
interest,  advances  and the  principal  balance  of a loan and the value of the
property.  Measurement  of that excess or  shortfall is the best  predictor  and
determinant of loss compared to other measures that evaluate the efficiency of a
particular farm operator.

     Loan-to-value  ratios  depend upon the market value of a property  with due
regard for its income-producing  potential in the hands of a competent operator.
As required by Farmer  Mac's  collateral  valuation  standards,  an appraisal of
agricultural   real  estate  must  include  analysis  of  the  income  producing
capability  of the  property  and  address  the  income  estimate  in the market
analysis. Debt service ratios depend upon farm operator efficiency and leverage,
which  can vary  widely  within  a  geographic  region,  commodity  type,  or an
operator's business and farming skills.

     As of December 31, 2004, the weighted-average  original loan-to-value ratio
for  all  post-1996  Act  loans  and  loans  underlying  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  and  LTSPCs  was  50  percent,  and  the  weighted-average  original
loan-to-value ratio for all post-1996 Act non-performing assets was 55 percent.

     The following table summarizes the post-1996 Act  non-performing  assets by
original loan-to-value ratio:

</TABLE>

     An analysis  of Farmer  Mac's  historical  losses and  identified  specific
collateral  deficiencies  within the portfolio (by  origination  year) indicates
that  Farmer Mac has  experienced  peak loss  years as loans  have aged  between
approximately their third and fifth years subsequent to origination,  regardless
of the year the loans were added to Farmer Mac's portfolio.  As a consequence of
the combination of principal  amortization  and collateral  value  appreciation,
there  are few  loans  in the  portfolio  originated  prior to 1996  with  known
collateral deficiencies.  While Farmer Mac expects that there will be loans that
have aged  past  their  fifth  year that will  become  delinquent  and  possibly
default, Farmer Mac does not anticipate significant losses on such loans.

     Analysis of portfolio performance by commodity  distribution indicates that
losses and  collateral  deficiencies  have been and are  expected to remain less
prevalent in the loans secured by real estate producing agricultural commodities
that receive significant government support (such as cotton, soybeans, wheat and
corn)  and more  prevalent  in those  that do not  receive  such  support.  This
analysis is consistent with corresponding  commodity  analysis,  which indicates
that Farmer Mac has experienced  higher loss and collateral  deficiency rates in
its loans  classified as permanent  plantings.  Most of the loans  classified as
permanent  plantings  do not  receive  significant  government  support  and are
therefore  more  susceptible  to  adverse  commodity-specific  economic  trends.
Further, as adverse economic conditions persist for a particular  commodity that
requires a long-term  improvement on the land, such as permanent plantings,  the
prospective  sale value of the land is likely to decrease and the related  loans
may  become  under-collateralized.  Farmer  Mac  anticipates  that  one or  more
particular  commodity groups will be under economic pressure at any one time and
actively manages its portfolio to mitigate  concentration risks while preserving
Farmer Mac's ability to meet the financing needs of all commodity groups.

     Analysis of portfolio  performance  by  geographic  distribution  indicates
that, while commodities are the primary  determinant of exposure to loss, within
most commodity groups certain  geographic areas allow greater economies of scale
or proximity to markets than others and, consequently, result in more successful
farms within the  commodity  group.  Likewise,  certain  geographic  areas offer
better  growing  conditions  than  others  and,  consequently,  result  in  more
versatile and more  successful  farms within a given  commodity  group - and the
ability to switch crops among commodity groups.

     Farmer Mac's  methodologies  for pricing its guarantee and commitment fees,
managing credit risks and providing adequate  allowances for losses consider all
of the foregoing factors and information.

      Credit Risk - Institutional. Farmer Mac is also exposed to credit risk
arising from its business relationships with other institutions including:

     o    issuers of AgVantage bonds and other investments held by Farmer Mac;
     o    sellers and servicers; and
     o    interest rate contract counterparties.

AgVantage bonds are general obligations of the AgVantage Issuers and are secured
by collateral  in an amount  ranging from 120 percent to 150 percent of the bond
amount.  In addition to requiring  collateral,  Farmer Mac mitigates credit risk
related to AgVantage bonds by evaluating and monitoring the financial  condition
of the issuers of the AgVantage bonds. Outstanding AgVantage bonds totaled $24.3
million as of December 31, 2004, and $25.2 million as of December 31, 2003.

     Farmer Mac  manages  institutional  credit  risk  related  to  sellers  and
servicers by requiring  those  institutions  to meet Farmer Mac's  standards for
creditworthiness.   Farmer  Mac  monitors  the  financial   condition  of  those
institutions  by evaluating  financial  statements and bank credit rating agency
reports and confirms that they maintain  adequate  fidelity bonds and errors and
omissions  insurance.  For more information on Farmer Mac's approval of sellers,
see  "Business--Farmer Mac Programs--Farmer Mac I--Sellers." Credit risk related
to interest  rate  contracts is discussed in "--Risk  Management--Interest  Rate
Risk" and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

     Credit  Risk -  Other  Investments.  The  credit  risk  inherent  in  other
investments  held by  Farmer  Mac is  mitigated  by  Farmer  Mac's  policies  of
investing in highly-rated  instruments and  establishing  concentration  limits,
which reduce exposure to any one  counterparty.  Farmer Mac's policies limit the
Corporation's total credit exposure,  including uncollateralized credit exposure
resulting from financial derivatives,  to a single entity by limiting the dollar
amount of investments  with each individual  entity to the greater of 25 percent
of Farmer Mac's regulatory core capital or $25 million. That limitation excludes
exposure to agencies of the U.S. government, GSEs and money market funds. Farmer
Mac policy also requires each individual  entity to be rated in one of the three
highest  rating  categories  of at least one NRSRO for  investments  with  terms
greater  than 270  days  and in one of the two  highest  rating  categories  for
investments with terms of 270 days or less.

     As of December 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac had  investments in commercial  paper,
corporate debt securities,  asset-backed securities,  auction rate certificates,
and  preferred  stock issued by thirty-six  entities  totaling  $959.0  million.
Farmer Mac's  investments in eighteen of these entities each exceeded 10 percent
of Farmer Mac's core  capital (the  cumulative  balance of  investments  in such
entities totaled $475.0 million),  and investments in two of these entities each
exceeded 15 percent of core  capital.  In  addition,  as of December  31,  2004,
Farmer Mac held $237.0  million of securities  issued by GSEs or agencies of the
U.S.  government and $290.4 million in three money market  investment  accounts.
The maximum amount held in any one money market fund investment fund at any time
during 2004 was  approximately  $609.5  million.  As of December 31, 2004,  36.2
percent  of  Farmer  Mac's  investment  portfolio,   excluding  GSE  and  agency
investments, consisted of short-term highly liquid investments.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Farmer Mac has  sufficient  liquidity and capital  resources to support its
operations  for the next twelve  months and has a  contingency  funding  plan to
handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to the capital markets.

     Debt Issuance.  Section 8.6(e) of Farmer Mac's statutory charter (12 U.S.C.
section 2279aa-6(e)) authorizes Farmer Mac to issue debt obligations to purchase
eligible  mortgage  loans and Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities and to maintain
reasonable amounts for business operations, including adequate liquidity. Farmer
Mac  funds  its  program  purchases   primarily  by  issuing  debt  obligations,
consisting of discount notes and medium-term notes of various maturities, in the
public capital  markets.  Farmer Mac also issues  discount notes and medium-term
notes  to  obtain  funds to  finance  its  investments,  transaction  costs  and
guarantee and LTSPC payments.

     The  Corporation's  discount notes and medium-term notes are obligations of
Farmer Mac only,  are not rated by a nationally  recognized  statistical  rating
organization  and the interest and principal  thereon are not guaranteed by, and
do not  constitute  debts or  obligations  of, FCA or the  United  States or any
agency or instrumentality of the United States other than Farmer Mac. Farmer Mac
is an  institution  of the FCS, but is not liable for any debt or  obligation of
any  other  institution  of the FCS.  Likewise,  neither  the FCS nor any  other
individual institution of the FCS is liable for any debt or obligation of Farmer
Mac.  Income to the purchaser of a Farmer Mac discount note or medium-term  note
is not exempt under federal law from federal, state or local taxation.


     Farmer Mac's board of directors has  authorized  the issuance of up to $5.0
billion of  discount  notes and  medium-term  notes (of which $3.5  billion  was
outstanding as of December 31, 2004), subject to periodic review of the adequacy
of that  level  relative  to Farmer  Mac's  borrowing  requirements.  Farmer Mac
invests  the  proceeds  of  such  issuances  in  loans,  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  and  non-program  investment  assets  in  accordance  with  policies
established by its board of directors.

     Liquidity.  The  funding  and  liquidity  needs of  Farmer  Mac's  business
programs  are  driven by the  purchase  and  retention  of loans and  Farmer Mac
Guaranteed  Securities,  the  maturities  of  Farmer  Mac's  discount  notes and
medium-term notes and payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities. Farmer Mac's primary sources of funds to meet these needs are:

     o    principal and interest  payments and ongoing  guarantee and commitment
          fees received on loans, Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs;
     o    principal and interest payments  received from investment  securities;
          and
     o    the issuance of new discount notes and medium-term notes.

     Farmer Mac  projects  its  expected  cash flows from loans and  securities,
other earnings and the sale of assets and matches those with its  obligations to
retire  debt and pay  other  liabilities  as they come due.  Farmer  Mac  issues
discount  notes  and  medium-term  notes to meet the needs  associated  with its
business operations,  including liquidity,  and also to increase its presence in
the capital markets in order to enhance the liquidity and pricing  efficiency of
its discount notes and  medium-term  notes and Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities
transactions  and so improve the mortgage rates  available to farmers,  ranchers
and rural homeowners.

     Though Farmer Mac's mortgage  purchases do not currently  necessitate daily
debt issuance,  the Corporation  continued its strategy of using its non-program
investment  portfolio  (referred  to as Farmer  Mac's  liquidity  portfolio)  to
facilitate  increasing its ongoing  presence in the capital markets during 2004.
To meet investor  demand for daily presence in the capital  markets,  Farmer Mac
issues  discount  notes  in  maturities  principally  ranging  from  one  day to
approximately  ninety days and invests the proceeds not needed for program asset
purchases in highly-rated  securities.  Investments are predominantly short-term
money market  securities  with  maturities  closely matched to the discount note
maturities and  floating-rate  securities with reset terms of less than one year
and closely matched to the maturity of the discount  notes.  The positive spread
earned from these investments enhances the net interest income Farmer Mac earns,
thereby improving the net yields at which Farmer Mac can purchase mortgages from
lenders who may pass that  benefit to  farmers,  ranchers  and rural  homeowners
through the Farmer Mac programs.  Subject to dollar amount, issuer concentration
and  credit  quality  limitations,  the  Corporation's  board of  directors  has
authorized non-program investments in:

     o    U.S. Treasury obligations;
     o    agency and instrumentality obligations;
     o    repurchase agreements;
     o    commercial paper;
     o    guaranteed investment contracts;
     o    certificates of deposit;
     o    federal funds and bankers acceptances;
     o    securities and debt obligations of corporate and municipal issuers;
     o    auction rate securities;
     o    mortgage-backed securities;
     o    asset-backed securities;
     o    corporate money market funds; and
     o    preferred stock of GSEs.

As of  December  31,  2004,  Farmer Mac was in  compliance  with the  investment
authorizations set forth in its investment guidelines.

December 31, 2004:

</TABLE>

     As a result  of  Farmer  Mac's  regular  issuance  of  discount  notes  and
medium-term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the
United  States,  Farmer  Mac has been  able to access  the  capital  markets  at
favorable rates. Farmer Mac has also used floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps,
combined with discount note issuances,  as a source of fixed-rate funding. While
the swap market may provide  favorable  fixed rates,  swap  transactions  expose
Farmer Mac to the risk of future  widening of its own  issuance  spreads  versus
corresponding  LIBOR rates. If the spreads on the Farmer Mac discount notes were
to  increase  relative to LIBOR,  Farmer Mac would be exposed to a  commensurate
reduction   on  its  net  interest   yield  on  the   notional   amount  of  its
floating-to-fixed  interest  rate  swaps and  other  LIBOR-based  floating  rate
assets.  Farmer Mac  compensates for this risk by pricing the required net yield
on program  asset  purchases to reflect the cost of  medium-term  notes  without
regard to the savings that may be achievable in the interest rate swap market.

     Farmer Mac  maintains a  liquidity  investment  portfolio  of cash and cash
equivalents  (including  commercial  paper and  other  short-term  money  market
instruments)  and  investment  securities  consisting  mostly of  floating  rate
securities  with rates that adjust within one year,  which can be drawn upon for
liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2004, Farmer Mac's cash and cash equivalents
and investment securities totaled $430.5 million and $1.1 billion, respectively,
a combined 38.7 percent of total assets and 42.7 percent of total notes payable.
In addition, as of December 31, 2004, Farmer Mac held a $712.7 million portfolio
of Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities backed by USDA-guaranteed  portions that
carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. As of December 31, 2004,
the  aggregate  of the Farmer Mac II  Guaranteed  Securities  and the  liquidity
investment  portfolio  represented 29.7 percent of total assets and 32.8 percent
of total notes payable.  During 2004, exclusive of daily overnight discount note
issuances the proceeds of which were invested  overnight,  the average  discount
note issuance term and re-funding frequency was approximately 58 days.

     The  principal  sources of funding for Farmer Mac's  obligations  under its
guarantees and LTSPCs are:

     o    the ongoing fees received on its guarantees and commitments:
     o    net interest income received on loans and Guaranteed Securities; and
     o    the proceeds of debt issuance.

Farmer Mac  satisfies  its  guarantee  and purchase  commitment  obligations  by
purchasing  defaulted loans out of LTSPCs and from the related trusts for Farmer
Mac Guaranteed  Securities.  Farmer Mac typically recovers a significant portion
of the value of defaulted loans purchased either through borrower payments, loan
payoffs,  payments  by third  parties or  foreclosure  and sale of the  property
securing the loans. Farmer Mac's liquidity position and ready access to the debt
markets also provide additional  flexibility to meet liquidity needs that result
from the  uncertainty  regarding the timing and amount of required  purchases of
loans  underlying  either Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  or LTSPCs,  should
significantly more loans be required to be purchased than in prior periods.


     Capital  Requirements.  The Act,  as amended  by the 1996 Act,  establishes
three capital standards for Farmer  Mac--minimum,  critical and risk-based.  The
minimum  capital  requirement  is expressed as a percentage of on-balance  sheet
assets and off-balance sheet obligations,  with the critical capital requirement
equal to one-half of the minimum  capital  amount.  Higher  minimum and critical
capital  requirements  were phased in over a transition  period,  which ended on
January 1, 1999,  when the highest level of minimum  capital became  applicable.
The Act does not specify the required  level of risk-based  capital.  It directs
FCA to  establish a  risk-based  capital  test for Farmer Mac,  using  specified
stress-test   parameters.   For  a  discussion   of  risk-based   capital,   see
"Business--Government     Regulation    of    Farmer    Mac--Regulation--Capital
Standards--General."

     Certain  enforcement  powers are given to FCA  depending  upon Farmer Mac's
compliance with the capital standards. See  "Business--Government  Regulation of
Farmer  Mac--Regulation--Capital  Standards--Enforcement levels." As of December
31, 2004 and 2003,  Farmer Mac was  classified  as within "level I" (the highest
compliance  level).  The following table sets forth Farmer Mac's minimum capital
requirement  as of  December  31,  2004 and 2003  based on the  fully  phased-in
requirements.

</TABLE>

     Based on the statutory minimum capital  requirements,  Farmer Mac's current
capital  surplus would support  additional  guarantee  growth in amounts ranging
from $3.9 billion of on-balance  sheet  guarantees to more than $14.5 billion of
off-balance sheet guarantees and commitments. Furthermore, Farmer Mac could sell
$1.5 billion of on-balance sheet  non-program  assets (cash and cash equivalents
and investment  securities) and $2.3 billion of on-balance  sheet program assets
in order to support  further  increases  of on- and  off-balance  sheet  program
guarantees and commitments.  Any transactions  would be evaluated for compliance
with  risk-based  capital  requirements  and to optimize  Farmer Mac's return on
equity and capital flexibility.

     Based on the  risk-based  capital  stress  test,  Farmer  Mac's  risk-based
capital  requirement  as of December 31, 2004 was $37.1 million and Farmer Mac's
regulatory  capital of $254.8  million  exceeded  that  amount by  approximately
$217.7 million.

     Accordingly,  in the  opinion  of  management,  Farmer  Mac has  sufficient
capital and liquidity for the next twelve months.

Arrangements. The following table presents the amount and timing of Farmer Mac's

     internal  audit  services,  consulting  services,   information  technology
     support,  equipment  maintenance,   and  financial  analysis  software  and
     services.  The amounts  actually paid under these agreements will likely be
     higher due to the variable  components  of some of these  agreements  under
     which the ultimate  obligation  owed is  determined  by reference to actual
     usage or hours  worked.  The  table  does not  include  amounts  due  under
     agreements  that are cancelable  without  penalty or further  payment as of
     December 31, 2004 and  therefore do not represent  enforceable  and legally
     binding obligations.  The table also does not include amounts due under the
     terms of employment agreements with members of senior management;  nor does
     it include  payments  that are based on a varying  outstanding  loan volume
     (such as  servicing  fees),  as those  payments  are not  known  fixed  and
     determinable contractual obligations.
</FN>
</TABLE>

See the  tables  below  in this  section  for  information  about  Farmer  Mac's
commitments  to purchase  loans and Farmer Mac's  contingent  obligations  under
outstanding Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

     Farmer Mac enters into financial derivative contracts under which it either
receives cash from counterparties, or is required to pay cash to them, depending
on  changes  in  interest  rates.  Financial  derivatives  are  carried  on  the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value,  representing the net present value of
expected  future cash payments or receipts based on market  interest rates as of
the balance sheet date. The fair values of the contracts  change daily as market
interest rates change.  Because the financial derivative liabilities recorded on
the  consolidated  balance  sheet as of December 31, 2004 do not  represent  the
amounts that may  ultimately be paid under the financial  derivative  contracts,
those  liabilities  are not  included  in the table of  contractual  obligations
presented above. Further information regarding financial derivatives is included
in Note 2(h) and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

     In  conducting  its  loan  purchase  activities,  Farmer  Mac  enters  into
mandatory and optional delivery  commitments to purchase  agricultural  mortgage
loans and  corresponding  optional  commitments to deliver Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities.  As of  December  31,  2004 and  2003,  Farmer  Mac had no  optional
delivery  commitments  to  purchase  loans  or  deliver  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  outstanding.  In conducting its LTSPC activities,  Farmer Mac enters
into  arrangements  whereby it commits to buy agricultural  mortgage loans at an
undetermined  future  date.  The  following  table  presents  these  significant
commitments.

Further  information  regarding  commitments  to purchase and sell  agricultural
mortgage loans is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

     Farmer  Mac  also may have  liabilities  that  arise  from its  Farmer  Mac
Guaranteed  Securities.  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  are issued  through
trusts and, when sold to third-party investors, accordingly, are not included in
the consolidated balance sheets. In performing its obligations related to LTSPCs
and Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities, Farmer Mac would have the right to enforce
the  underlying  agricultural  mortgage  loans,  and in the event of the default
under the terms of those loans, would have access to the underlying collateral.

Regulatory Matters

     Regulatory  actions continue to affect Farmer Mac's business outlook.  Both
FCA and FCSIC have  cautioned FCS  institutions  about doing business with GSEs,
including  Farmer  Mac,  and  FCSIC  has  raised  technical  objections  to  FCS
institutions' use of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities swaps.

     During second quarter 2004, FCA published a proposed regulation relating to
Farmer Mac's investments and liquidity.  Farmer Mac expects to be able to comply
with the  regulation  if it is  adopted in its  current  form,  though  analysis
indicates it could limit future increases in Farmer Mac's non-program investment
portfolio and the related net interest  income.  The Corporation  disagrees with
certain  aspects  of the  proposed  regulation  and  submitted  comments  on the
proposal to FCA accordingly.

     On August 6, 2004, FCA published a proposed  regulation that, if adopted as
proposed,  could  adversely  affect Farmer Mac's business by  establishing a new
risk-weight allocation of capital applicable to Farmer Mac transactions with FCS
institutions,  a major  segment of Farmer  Mac's  customer  base.  The  proposed
regulation would require FCS  institutions to risk-weight  assets on their books
that are guaranteed by a GSE based on the financial  strength rating of the GSE,
as determined  by an NRSRO.  Under the proposed  regulation:  (a) the 20 percent
risk-weight would apply to such assets only if the GSE guarantor had a AAA or AA
rating from an NRSRO; (b) an A rating would result in a 50 percent  risk-weight;
and (c) a lower rating (or no rating) would result in a 100 percent risk-weight.
Farmer Mac is  currently  unrated.  Currently,  all banking  regulators  and FCA
accord a 20 percent  risk-weight  to assets backed by guarantees of GSEs such as
Fannie Mae,  Freddie Mac or Farmer Mac. The proposed  regulation is subject to a
90-day  public  comment  period and, as drafted,  would have an  effective  date
eighteen months after the final regulation is published.

     If the proposed  regulation  is adopted as a final rule in its current form
and  Farmer  Mac does not  receive  a rating of at least AA  within  the  period
provided for in the proposed  regulation,  the benefit to an FCS  institution of
doing  business  with Farmer Mac would be  diminished  after the adoption of the
regulation, and a significant portion of the current $2.9 billion of outstanding
Farmer Mac I guarantees and commitments currently in place with FCS institutions
might be  subject  to early  termination.  There  can be no  assurance  that the
regulation  will not be  adopted as a final rule in its  current  form,  or in a
modified form with substantially the same effect. Likewise, Farmer Mac currently
is not rated,  and there can be no assurance that Farmer Mac would receive a AAA
or AA  rating  from an  NRSRO.  As set forth in prior  disclosures,  Farmer  Mac
disagrees with the proposed  regulation as it would affect the Corporation,  and
has submitted a comment letter to FCA setting forth its position.


Other Matters

     New  Accounting  Standards.  On  January 1, 2003,  Farmer Mac  adopted  the
liability  recognition  provisions of the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board
Interpretation  No. 45, Guarantor's  Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements for
Guarantees,  Including Indirect  Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ("FIN 45")
which  requires  Farmer Mac to  recognize,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a
liability  for the fair value of its  obligation to stand ready to perform under
the terms of each  guarantee  agreement  and an asset  that is equal to the fair
value of the  fees  that  will be  received  over  the  life of each  guarantee.
Subsequently,  both the asset and the  liability  are  measured  and recorded at
their fair value. In December of 2003, the SEC provided  additional  guidance on
the "day two"  accounting for these  financial  instruments.  In accordance with
this  guidance,  Farmer Mac has  adopted  the  amortized  cost model for day two
accounting.   This  guidance  was  applied   prospectively  for  guarantees  and
commitments  recorded at December 31, 2003 and all  guarantees  and  commitments
issued or modified on or after January 1, 2004.

     In December 2003, the American  Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants
issued  Statement  of  Position  03-3,  Accounting  for  Certain  Loans  or Debt
Securities  Acquired in a Transfer ("SOP 03-3").  SOP 03-3 addresses  accounting
for  differences  between  contractual  cash flows and cash flows expected to be
collected  from an investor's  initial  investment  in loans or debt  securities
acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable,  at least in part,
to credit quality.  Specifically, SOP 03-3 limits the yield that may be accreted
and prohibits the  "carry-over" of a valuation  allowance for all impaired loans
that are within the scope of SOP 03-3.  SOP 03-3 is effective for loans acquired
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004.  Farmer Mac is evaluating the
impact of SOP 03-3, and will adopt it when effective.

     In March 2004, the Emerging  Issues Task Force ("EITF")  amended EITF 03-1,
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary  Impairment, to introduce a three-step model
to: (1) determine  whether an investment is impaired;  (2) evaluate  whether the
impairment  is  other-than-temporary;  and (3) account for  other-than-temporary
impairments. In part, this amendment requires companies to apply qualitative and
quantitative  measures  to  determine  whether a decline  in the fair value of a
security is  other-than-temporary.  The guidance in EITF 03-1 is  effective  for
reporting  periods  beginning after June 15, 2004, with the exception of certain
sections,  which have been deferred.  Farmer Mac is evaluating the impact of the
amendment and will adopt it when it is effective in full. In the interim, Farmer
Mac  continues to apply earlier  authoritative  accounting  guidance,  primarily
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 115,  Accounting  for Certain
Investments  in Debt and  Equity  Securities  and  EITF  99-20,  Recognition  of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in
Securitized   Financial   Assets,   for  the   measurement  and  recognition  of
other-than-temporary impairment of its debt and equity securities.

     In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based  Payment ("SFAS 123(R)").  SFAS 123(R) is a
revision  of  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  Statement  No.  123,
Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation ("SFAS 123") and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees  ("APB 25"),  and its related
implementation  guidance.  SFAS 123(R)  requires a public  entity to measure the
cost  of  employee  services  received  in  exchange  for  an  award  of  equity
instruments  based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  That cost will be
recognized  over the period  during  which an  employee  is  required to provide
service in exchange for the award.  The grant-date  fair value of employee share
options and similar  instruments will be estimated using  option-pricing  models
adjusted  for the  unique  characteristics  of those  instruments.  SFAS  123(R)
eliminates the  alternative to use APB 25's intrinsic value method of accounting
that was provided in SFAS 123 as originally issued.  Currently,  as discussed in
Note 2(m), Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans
using the  intrinsic  value  method of  accounting  for employee  stock  options
pursuant to APB 25 and has adopted the  disclosure-only  provisions of SFAS 123.
The guidance in SFAS 123(R) is effective for reporting  periods  beginning after
June 15, 2005.  Farmer Mac is  evaluating  the impact of SFAS  123(R),  and will
adopt it when effective.



Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

     Farmer Mac is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. Farmer
Mac manages this market risk by entering  into various  financial  transactions,
including  financial  derivatives,  and by monitoring its exposure to changes in
interest rates. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and  Results  of  Operations--Risk  Management--Interest  Rate  Risk"  for  more
information  about Farmer Mac's exposure to interest rate risk and strategies to
manage such risk. For information  regarding  Farmer Mac's use of and accounting
policies for financial derivatives, see Note 2(h) and Note 6 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Item 8. Financial Statements



MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

     The  management  of  Farmer  Mac  is  responsible  for   establishing   and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
over financial  reporting is a process  designed under the supervision of Farmer
Mac's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide  reasonable
assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation
of the  Corporation's  financial  statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

     Farmer Mac's  internal  control over  financial  reporting  includes  those
policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable   detail,   accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the   transactions  and
dispositions of the assets of the Corporation;  (2) provide reasonable assurance
that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and  expenditures  of the Corporation are being made only in accordance
with  authorizations  of management  and directors of the  Corporation;  and (3)
provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of
unauthorized  acquisition,  use or disposition of the Corporation's  assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

     Because  of its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of  effectiveness  to future  periods are subject to the risk that  controls may
become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     With the  participation of the  Corporation's  Chief Executive  Officer and
Chief Financial Officer,  Farmer Mac's management  assessed the effectiveness of
the Corporation's  internal control over financial  reporting as of December 31,
2004. In making this assessment,  the Corporation's management used the criteria
set  forth  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway
Commission  (COSO)  in  Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework.  Based  on its
assessment,  management  has  concluded  that,  as of  December  31,  2004,  the
Corporation's  internal  control over financial  reporting is effective based on
those criteria.

     Farmer Mac's  independent  registered  public  accounting firm,  Deloitte &
Touche LLP, has audited  management's  assessment  of the  effectiveness  of the
Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
as stated in their report, appearing below, which expresses unqualified opinions
on  management's  assessment  and on  the  effectiveness  of  the  Corporation's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED  PUBLIC  ACCOUNTING  FIRM  REGARDING  INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Washington, DC

We  have  audited   management's   assessment,   included  in  the  accompanying
Management's  Report on Internal  Control  Over  Financial  Reporting,  that the
Federal   Agricultural   Mortgage  Corporation  and  subsidiary  ("Farmer  Mac")
maintained  effective  internal control over financial  reporting as of December
31,  2004,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal   Control--Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway
Commission.  Farmer Mac's  management is responsible for  maintaining  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its  assessment  of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial  reporting.  Our responsibility
is to  express  an  opinion  on  management's  assessment  and an opinion on the
effectiveness of Farmer Mac's internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.

We conducted  our audit in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting,  evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other  procedures as we considered  necessary in the  circumstances.  We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial  reporting is a process designed by,
or under the  supervision  of, the company's  principal  executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company's  board of  directors,  management,  and  other  personnel  to  provide
reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the
preparation  of financial  statements for external  purposes in accordance  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A company's  internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the assets of the company;  (2)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because  of  the  inherent   limitations  of  internal  control  over  financial
reporting,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management
override of controls,  material  misstatements  due to error or fraud may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also,  projections of any evaluation of
the  effectiveness  of the internal  control over financial  reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate  because
of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,  management's  assessment  that Farmer Mac maintained  effective
internal  control over  financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004,  is fairly
stated, in all material  respects,  based on the framework in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, Farmer Mac maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004,  based  on  the  criteria  established  in  Internal   Control--Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the Treadway
Commission.

We have also  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting   Oversight  Board  (United  States),   the  consolidated   financial
statements as of and for the year ended  December 31, 2004 of Farmer Mac and our
report dated March 14, 2005 expressed an unqualified  opinion on those financial
statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Washington, DC


We have  audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of the Federal
Agricultural  Mortgage  Corporation and subsidiary ("Farmer Mac") as of December
31,  2004 and 2003,  and the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,
changes in stockholders'  equity,  and cash flows for each of the three years in
the  period  ended  December  31,  2004.  These  financial  statements  are  the
responsibility of Farmer Mac's management.  Our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material respects,  the financial position of the Federal Agricultural  Mortgage
Corporation  and  subsidiary  at December 31, 2004 and 2003,  and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  December 31, 2004, in conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have also  audited,  in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting  Oversight Board (United States),  the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the
criteria  established in Internal  Control--Integrated  Framework  issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated March 14, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment
of the  effectiveness of Farmer Mac's internal control over financial  reporting
and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Farmer Mac's internal control
over financial reporting.

            FEDERAL AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002


1. ORGANIZATION

     The  Federal  Agricultural   Mortgage  Corporation  ("Farmer  Mac"  or  the
"Corporation") was chartered by the U.S. Congress in the Agricultural Credit Act
of 1987 (12 U.S.C.  sections 2279aa et seq.),  which amended the Farm Credit Act
of 1971 (collectively, as amended, the "Act"). Farmer Mac is a stockholder-owned
instrumentality  of the United  States that was created to establish a secondary
market for  agricultural  real estate and rural  housing  mortgage  loans and to
increase  the  availability  of  long-term  credit at stable  interest  rates to
American farmers, ranchers and rural homeowners. The Farmer Mac secondary market
for agricultural mortgage loans accomplishes that mission by providing liquidity
and lending capacity to agricultural mortgage lenders by:

     o    purchasing  newly originated and  pre-existing  ("seasoned")  eligible
          mortgage loans directly from lenders;
     o    exchanging  newly  issued  agricultural   mortgage-backed   securities
          guaranteed  by Farmer Mac ("Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed  Securities")  for
          newly originated and seasoned  eligible mortgage loans that back those
          securities in "swap" transactions;
     o    issuing  long-term standby purchase  commitments  ("LTSPCs") for newly
          originated and seasoned eligible mortgage loans; and
     o    purchasing and guaranteeing  mortgage-backed bonds secured by eligible
          mortgage loans, which are referred to as AgVantage bonds.

Farmer Mac conducts  these  activities  through two  programs--Farmer  Mac I and
Farmer Mac II. Under the Farmer Mac I program, Farmer Mac:

     o    purchases eligible mortgage loans;
     o    securitizes  eligible  mortgage  loans  purchased and  guarantees  the
          timely   payment  of  principal  and  interest  on  the   agricultural
          mortgage-backed securities backed by such loans; and
     o    commits to purchase  eligible  mortgage  loans  under  LTSPCs for such
          loans.

To be  eligible  for the  Farmer Mac I program,  loans  must meet  Farmer  Mac's
underwriting,  appraisal, documentation and other specified standards. Under the
Farmer Mac II program,  Farmer Mac  purchases the  guaranteed  portions of loans
guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture (the  "USDA-guaranteed
portions") pursuant to the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C.
sections 1921 et seq.) and guarantees securities backed by those USDA-guaranteed
portions purchased by Farmer Mac.

As of December  31,  2004,  outstanding  loans held by Farmer Mac and loans that
either back Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities or are subject to LTSPCs  totaled
$5.5  billion.  Farmer Mac may retain  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities in its
portfolio or sell them to third parties.

Farmer Mac's two principal sources of revenue are:

     o    fees received in connection  with  outstanding  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
          Securities and LTSPCs; and
     o    net interest  income earned on its portfolio of Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
          Securities, mortgage loans and investments.

Farmer Mac funds its program purchases  primarily by issuing debt obligations of
various  maturities.  As of December 31, 2004,  Farmer Mac had outstanding  $1.8
billion of discount  notes and $1.7 billion of medium-term  notes.  During 2004,
the Corporation continued its strategy of regularly issuing debt to increase its
presence  in the  capital  markets  in order to reduce  the rates it pays on its
debt,  which  allows  Farmer Mac to accept  lower rates on mortgages to farmers,
ranchers and rural homeowners that it purchases from lenders.  To the extent the
proceeds of the debt issuances  exceed Farmer Mac's need to fund program assets,
those proceeds are invested in high quality non-program liquid assets.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The  accounting  and  reporting  policies of Farmer Mac conform with  accounting
principles  generally  accepted  in the  United  States of  America  ("generally
accepted  accounting  principles").  The preparation of  consolidated  financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires
management to make certain  estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts of assets and  liabilities  and  disclosures  of  contingent  assets and
liabilities  (including,  but not limited  to, the  allowance  for loan  losses,
reserve for losses, and valuation of Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities) as of the
date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following are the significant accounting policies that Farmer Mac
follows in preparing and presenting its consolidated financial statements:

(a)   Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Farmer Mac and its
wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Farmer Mac Securities  Corporation,  whose  principal
activities  are to facilitate the purchase and issuance of Farmer Mac Guaranteed
Securities and to act as a registrant under  registration  statements filed with
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.   All  inter-company   balances  and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)   Cash and Cash Equivalents

Farmer  Mac  considers  highly  liquid  investment   securities  with  remaining
maturities  of  three  months  or  less  at the  time  of  purchase  to be  cash
equivalents. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents are reported in
the  consolidated  statements  of cash  flows.  The  following  table sets forth
information regarding certain cash and non-cash transactions for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

</TABLE>

(c)   Investments and Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

Farmer Mac  classifies  investments  and Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities  that
Farmer  Mac has  the  positive  intent  and  ability  to  hold  to  maturity  as
held-to-maturity.  Such securities are carried at cost, adjusted for unamortized
premiums and unearned  discounts.  Securities for which Farmer Mac does not have
the positive intent to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale and
are  carried  at  estimated   fair  value.   Unrealized   gains  and  losses  on
available-for-sale  securities are reported as accumulated  other  comprehensive
income/(loss)  in  stockholders'   equity.   Securities  classified  as  trading
securities are reported at their fair value,  with  unrealized  gains and losses
included in  earnings.  Gains and losses on the sale of  available-for-sale  and
trading securities are determined using the specific identification cost method.

Farmer Mac determines the fair value of Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities  based
on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows. In estimating
the present value of the expected  future cash flows,  management is required to
make estimates and assumptions. The key estimates and assumptions include future
discount rates and collateral  repayment  rates.  Premiums,  discounts and other
deferred  costs are amortized to interest  income over the estimated life of the
security using the effective interest method. Interest income on investments and
Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  is recorded on an accrual  basis  unless the
collection of interest is considered doubtful.

Farmer Mac generally receives  compensation  (yield  maintenance  payments) when
loans  with  yield  maintenance  provisions  underlying  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities prepay. These payments mitigate Farmer Mac's exposure to reinvestment
risk and are calculated such that,  when reinvested with the prepaid  principal,
they  should  generate  substantially  the same cash  flows that would have been
generated had the loans not prepaid.  Yield maintenance  payments are recognized
as interest income in the consolidated statements of operations upon receipt.

(d)   Loans

Loans for which Farmer Mac has the  positive  intent and ability to hold for the
foreseeable  future are  classified as held for investment and reported at their
unpaid principal balance net of unamortized purchase discounts or premiums.  The
net  unamortized  purchase  premiums as of December  31, 2004 and 2003 were $9.4
million and $13.3 million,  respectively.  Loans that Farmer Mac does not intend
to hold for the foreseeable  future are classified as held for sale and reported
at the lower of cost or market using the aggregate method.

(e)   Securitization of Loans

Asset securitization involves the transfer of financial assets to another entity
in exchange  for cash and/or  beneficial  interests  in the assets  transferred.
Farmer Mac transfers  agricultural  mortgage  loans into trusts that are used as
vehicles  for the  securitization  of the  transferred  loans.  The trusts issue
Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities that are beneficial interests in the assets of
the trusts, to either Farmer Mac or third party investors. Farmer Mac may either
retain the securities  issued by the trusts or sell the securities issued by the
trusts to third party investors.

Farmer Mac  guarantees  the timely  payment of  principal  and  interest  on the
securities issued by the trusts and receives  guarantee fees as compensation for
its guarantee. Farmer Mac recognizes guarantee fees on an accrual basis over the
terms of the Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities,  which coincide with the terms of
the underlying  loans. As such, no guarantee fees are unearned at the end of any
reporting  period. If Farmer Mac purchases a delinquent loan underlying a Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Security,  Farmer Mac stops accruing the guarantee fee upon the
loan purchase.

Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial  Assets and  Extinguishments  of  Liabilities  ("SFAS
140"),  which became effective for transfers of financial assets after March 31,
2001,  expanded the requirements for "qualifying special purposes entities." The
trust vehicles used in loan securitization transactions after March 31, 2001, in
which Farmer Mac retains all the Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities issued by the
trust, do not meet the "qualifying special purpose entity"  requirements of SFAS
140.  Accordingly,  Farmer Mac accounts for the Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities
it retains in these transactions as loans in its consolidated balance sheets and
the guarantee fees earned on those assets are recorded as interest income in the
consolidated  statements of  operations.  The Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities
securitized prior to April 1, 2001 that Farmer Mac retained,  have been recorded
in Farmer  Mac's  consolidated  financial  statements  as Farmer Mac  Guaranteed
Securities and are classified and accounted for in accordance  with Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 115,  Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities ("SFAS 115").

Transfers  of  agricultural  mortgage  loans  into  trusts in which  Farmer  Mac
surrenders  control over the financial  assets and receives  compensation  other
than  beneficial  interests in the underlying  loans are recorded as sales under
SFAS 140.  The  carrying  amount of the  assets  that are  transferred  in these
transactions is allocated between the assets sold and the interests retained, if
any,  based on the relative fair values of each at the date of the  transfer.  A
gain or loss is included  in income for the  difference  between  the  allocated
carrying  amount of the asset sold and the net cash proceeds  received.  In 2004
Farmer Mac realized  $0.4 million gain on sale of loans  accounted  for as sales
under SFAS 140. In 2003 and 2002, Farmer Mac did not realize any gains or losses
upon the sale of loans accounted for as sales under SFAS 140.

When  particular  criteria are met, such as the default of the borrower,  Farmer
Mac has the option to  repurchase  the  defaulted  loans  underlying  Farmer Mac
Guaranteed   Securities   (these   options   are   commonly   referred   to   as
"removal-of-account"   provisions).  Farmer  Mac  records  these  loans  in  the
consolidated  financial statements during the period in which Farmer Mac has the
option to repurchase the loans and therefore  regains effective control over the
transferred loans.

(f)   Nonaccrual Loans

Nonaccrual  loans are loans for which it is  probable  that  Farmer  Mac will be
unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement and include all loans 90 days or more past due. When a loan becomes 90
days  past  due,  interest  accrual  on the loan is  discontinued  and  interest
previously  accrued is reversed  against  interest income in the current period.
The  interest  on such loans is  accounted  for on the cash  basis  until a loan
qualifies  for return to accrual  status.  Loans are returned to accrual  status
when all the principal and interest payments contractually due are collected and
loans meet certain performance criteria.

(g)   Real Estate Owned

Real estate owned consists of real estate  acquired  through  foreclosure and is
recorded at fair value less estimated  selling costs at acquisition.  Fair value
is  determined  by  appraisal  or other  appropriate  valuation  method.  Losses
estimated  at the time of  acquisition  are  charged to the  allowance  for loan
losses. Subsequent to the acquisition,  management continues to perform periodic
valuations and establishes a valuation allowance for real estate owned through a
charge to income in the provision for losses if the carrying value of a property
exceeds its estimated fair value less estimated selling costs.

Farmer Mac contracts with third parties to operate or preserve real estate owned
and   offered  for  sale  when   appropriate   to   maintain   property   value.
Non-recoverable  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  and  those  related  to the
production  of saleable  goods or crops are  capitalized  to the extent they are
realizable.  As revenues from the sale of goods or crops are received,  they are
applied  first  to any  capitalized  costs  and any  remaining  revenues  offset
non-recoverable expenses incurred.

(h)   Financial Derivatives

Farmer Mac enters into financial derivative transactions  principally to protect
against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate  movements on the
value of certain assets and future cash flows or debt issuance,  not for trading
or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters into interest rate swap  contracts
principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to match more
closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics of its longer-term  mortgage
and other assets,  and also to adjust the  characteristics of its long-term debt
to  match  more  closely  the  cash  flow and  duration  characteristics  of its
short-term assets,  thereby reducing interest rate risk. These transactions also
may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than would otherwise be
available in the conventional debt market.

Farmer Mac  recognizes  contracts and  commitments  as financial  derivatives in
accordance with Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended ("SFAS 133").

All financial  derivatives  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as a
freestanding asset or liability.  Financial derivatives in hedging relationships
that  mitigate  exposure  to changes in the fair value of assets are  considered
fair value hedges.  Financial derivatives in hedging relationships that mitigate
the  exposure  to the  variability  in  expected  future  cash  flows  or  other
forecasted  transactions are considered cash flow hedges.  Financial derivatives
that do not satisfy the hedging  criteria of SFAS 133 are not  accounted  for as
hedges  and  changes  in the fair  values  of those  financial  derivatives  are
reported as gains or losses on financial  derivatives  and trading assets in the
consolidated statements of operations.

Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the financial
derivative  and the change in fair value of the asset  attributable  to the risk
being hedged on the consolidated balance sheets with the net difference reported
as  ineffectiveness  in the  consolidated  statements of operations as a gain or
loss on financial derivatives. The adjustment to the hedged asset is included in
the reported  amount of the hedged item.  Cash  payments or receipts and related
amounts  accrued  during the reporting  period on financial  derivatives in fair
value hedging relationships are recorded as an adjustment to the interest income
on  the  hedged  asset.  If a  financial  derivative  in a  fair  value  hedging
relationship  is  no  longer  effective,   is  de-designated  from  its  hedging
relationship,  or is  terminated,  Farmer  Mac  discontinues  fair  value  hedge
accounting for the financial  derivative and the hedged item.  Accordingly,  the
hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in its fair value  attributable to
the risk being hedged. The accumulated  adjustment of the carrying amount of the
hedged asset is recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest  income over
the  expected  remaining  life of the asset using the  effective  interest  rate
method.

Cash flow hedges are  accounted for by recording the fair value of the financial
derivative as either a  freestanding  asset or a  freestanding  liability on the
consolidated  balance sheets,  with the effective  portion of the change in fair
value of the financial  derivative  recorded in accumulated other  comprehensive
income/(loss) within stockholders'  equity, net of tax. Amounts are reclassified
from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) to interest income or expense
in  the  consolidated   statements  of  operations  in  the  period  the  hedged
transaction  affects  earnings.  Any  ineffective  portion of the change in fair
value of the  financial  derivative  is reported as a gain or loss on  financial
derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statements of operations.  If
it becomes  probable that a hedged  forecasted  transaction  will not occur, any
amounts  included  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  related to the
specific  hedging   relationship  are   reclassified   from  accumulated   other
comprehensive  income/(loss)  to the  consolidated  statements of operations and
reported as gains or losses on financial derivatives and trading assets.

Gains and losses on financial  derivatives  not considered  highly  effective in
hedging  the change in fair value or expected  cash flows of the related  hedged
item are  recognized  in the  consolidated  statement of operations as a gain or
loss on financial  derivatives and trading assets,  as these  derivatives do not
qualify for hedge accounting  under SFAS 133. If a financial  derivative has not
been or will not continue to be highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is
discontinued prospectively and the financial derivative continues to be recorded
at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a gain or loss on financial
derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statement of operations.

(i)   Notes Payable

Notes payable are  classified as due within one year or due after one year based
on their contractual maturities.  Debt issuance costs are deferred and amortized
to  interest  income or expense  using the  effective  interest  method over the
estimated life of the related debt.

(j)   Allowance for Losses

Farmer Mac maintains an allowance and contingent  obligation for probable losses
("allowance  for losses") to cover  estimated  probable losses on loans held for
investment,  real estate owned and loans  underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs in  accordance  with  Statement  of Financial
Accounting  Standard  No.  5,  Accounting  for  Contingencies  ("SFAS  5"),  and
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standard No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan, as amended ("SFAS 114").  The  methodology for determining
the  allowance  for losses is the same for loans held for  investment  and loans
underlying  post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities and LTSPCs because
Farmer Mac believes the ultimate credit risk is  substantially  the same,  i.e.,
the underlying agricultural mortgage loans all meet the same credit underwriting
and appraisal standards.

The  allowance  for losses is increased  through  periodic  provisions  for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
that are charged to operating  expense and is reduced by charge-offs  for actual
losses, net of recoveries. Negative provisions for loan losses or provisions for
losses are recorded in the event that the estimate of probable  losses as of the
end of a period is lower  than the  estimate  at the  beginning  of the  period.
Charge-offs  represent losses on the outstanding principal balance, any interest
payments previously accrued or advanced and expected costs of liquidation.


Farmer Mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins with
management's  evaluation of the results of its proprietary  loan pool simulation
and  guarantee  fee  model  (the  "Model").  The  Model  draws  upon  historical
information  from a data set of  agricultural  mortgage  loans  recorded  over a
longer  period of time than Farmer  Mac's own  experience  to date,  screened to
include only those loans with credit  characteristics  similar to those on which
Farmer Mac has  assumed  credit  risk.  The results  generated  by the Model are
modified by the  application of management's  judgment,  as required to take key
factors into account, including:

     o    economic conditions;
     o    geographic and agricultural commodity/product concentrations in Farmer
          Mac's portfolio;
     o    the credit profile of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    delinquency trends of Farmer Mac's portfolio;
     o    Farmer  Mac's  experience  in the  management  and sale of real estate
          owned; and
     o    historical   charge-off  and  recovery   activities  of  Farmer  Mac's
          portfolio.

Management  believes  that  its  use of this  methodology  produces  a  reliable
estimate of total probable  losses,  as of the balance sheet date, for all loans
included in Farmer Mac's portfolio,  including loans held, real estate owned and
loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs.

Farmer  Mac also  specifically  analyzes  certain  assets in its  portfolio  for
impairment.  This analysis  measures  impairment  based on the fair value of the
underlying  collateral for each  individual  loan relative to the total recorded
investment,  including  principal,  interest and advances under SFAS 114. In the
event  that  the  updated  appraisal  or  management's  estimate  of  discounted
collateral  value does not support  the total  recorded  investment,  Farmer Mac
specifically  allocates an allowance for the loan for the difference between the
recorded  investment and its fair value,  less estimated  costs to liquidate the
collateral.

For this analysis and the allocation of specific allowances, Farmer Mac reviews:


     o    non-performing assets (loans 90 days or more past due, in foreclosure,
          restructured,  in bankruptcy - including loans performing under either
          their original loan terms or a  court-approved  bankruptcy  plan - and
          real estate owned);
     o    loans for which  Farmer  Mac had  adjusted  the  timing of  borrowers'
          payment  schedules,  but still  expects to collect all amounts due and
          has not made economic concessions; and
     o    additional  performing  loans that have  previously been delinquent or
          are secured by real estate that produces  agricultural  commodities or
          products currently under stress.

Management believes that the general allowance,  which is the difference between
the total  allowance  for losses  (generated  through  use of the Model) and the
specific  allowances,  adequately  covers any  probable  losses  inherent in the
portfolio of performing loans under SFAS 5.

Farmer Mac believes that the  methodology  described  above  produces a reliable
estimate of the total probable  losses inherent in Farmer Mac's  portfolio.  The
Model:

     o    uses  historical   agricultural   real  estate  loan  origination  and
          servicing  data that reflect  varied  economic  conditions  and stress
          levels in the agricultural sector;
     o    contains  features that allow variations for changes in loan portfolio
          characteristics  to make the data set more  representative  of  Farmer
          Mac's portfolio and credit underwriting standards; and
     o    considers  the effects of the ageing of the loan  portfolio  along the
          expected loss curves  associated  with individual  origination  years,
          including  the segments  that are entering into or coming out of their
          peak default years.

When certain  criteria are met, such as the default of the borrower,  Farmer Mac
may, in its sole discretion,  repurchase the defaulted loans  underlying  Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  and is obligated to purchase  those  underlying  an
LTSPC. These purchases are recorded in the consolidated  financial statements at
their fair value. Fair value is determined by appraisal or management's estimate
of discounted collateral value.

No  allowance  for  losses  has been  made for  loans  underlying  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed  Securities  issued prior to the 1996 Act or Farmer Mac II Guaranteed
Securities.  Farmer Mac I Guaranteed Securities issued prior to the 1996 Act are
supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests,  which are expected
to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans.  USDA-guaranteed  portions
collateralizing  Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities are obligations  backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States.  As of December 31, 2004, Farmer
Mac had experienced no credit losses on any pre-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities or on any Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities and does not expect to
incur any such losses in the future.


(k)   Earnings Per Common Share

Basic  earnings  per common  share are based on the  weighted-average  number of
common  shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings per common share is based on the
weighted-average  number of common  shares  outstanding  adjusted to include all
potentially  dilutive common stock options.  The following  schedule  reconciles
basic and diluted earnings per common share ("EPS") for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

(l)   Income Taxes

Deferred federal income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary
differences  between  financial  and taxable  income and are measured  using the
current  enacted  statutory tax rate.  Income tax expense is equal to the income
taxes  payable in the current year plus the net change in the deferred tax asset
or liability balance.

(m)   Stock-Based Compensation

Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans, which are
described  more fully in Note 9, using the intrinsic  value method of accounting
for employee stock options  pursuant to Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No.
25,   Accounting   for  Stock   Issued  to   Employees,   and  has  adopted  the
disclosure-only  provisions of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
123,  Accounting  for  Stock-Based   Compensation,   as  amended  ("SFAS  123").
Accordingly,  no compensation  expense was recognized in 2004, 2003 and 2002 for
employee stock option plans. Had Farmer Mac elected to use the fair value method
of  accounting  for  employee  stock  options,  net income  available  to common
stockholders  and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002  would  have been  reduced to the pro forma  amounts  indicated  in the
following table:

(n) Comprehensive Income/(Loss)

Comprehensive  income/(loss)  represents  all  changes in  stockholders'  equity
except those resulting from investments by or distributions to stockholders, and
is comprised of net income  available to common  stockholders,  unrealized gains
and losses on securities  available-for-sale  and the  effective  portion of the
unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  financial  derivatives  in cash  flow  hedge
relationships,   net  of   reclassification   adjustments   and  related  taxes.
Comprehensive  income is reported in the  consolidated  statements of changes in
stockholders'  equity.  The following  table presents  Farmer Mac's  accumulated
other comprehensive income/(loss) as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

</TABLE>

(o) Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments ("LTSPCs")

Farmer Mac accounts for its LTSPC  commitment fees in accordance with provisions
of FIN 45,  Guarantor's  Accounting and Disclosure  Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect  Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. In accordance with FIN
45,  commitment fee income  represents a reduction of the commitment  obligation
based on amortization  using the actual prepayment  experience on the underlying
loans,  which Farmer Mac refers to as the  Declining  Unpaid  Principal  Balance
Method. See Note 2(j) for Farmer Mac's policy for estimating probable losses for
LTSPCs.


(p)   New Accounting Standards

On January 1, 2003, Farmer Mac adopted the liability  recognition  provisions of
the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board  Interpretation  No. 45,  Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of  Indebtedness  of Others ("FIN 45"),  which requires Farmer Mac to
recognize,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a liability for the fair value of
its  obligation  to stand  ready to  perform  under the terms of each  guarantee
agreement  and an asset that is equal to the fair value of the fees that will be
received over the life of each  guarantee.  In December  2003,  the SEC provided
additional guidance on the "day two" accounting for these financial instruments.
In accordance  with this  guidance,  Farmer Mac has adopted the  amortized  cost
model for day two accounting effective January 1, 2004.

In December 2003, the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
Statement of Position  03-3,  Accounting  for Certain  Loans or Debt  Securities
Acquired  in  a  Transfer  ("SOP  03-3").  SOP  03-3  addresses  accounting  for
differences  between  contractual  cash  flows  and cash  flows  expected  to be
collected  from an investor's  initial  investment  in loans or debt  securities
acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable,  at least in part,
to credit quality.  Specifically, SOP 03-3 limits the yield that may be accreted
and prohibits the  "carry-over" of a valuation  allowance for all impaired loans
that are within the scope of SOP 03-3.  SOP 03-3 is effective for loans acquired
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004.  Farmer Mac is evaluating the
impact of SOP 03-3, and will adopt it when effective.

In March 2004, the Emerging  Issues Task Force  ("EITF")  amended EITF 03-1, The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary  Impairment, to introduce a three-step model to:
(1)  determine  whether an  investment  is impaired;  (2)  evaluate  whether the
impairment  is  other-than-temporary;  and (3) account for  other-than-temporary
impairments. In part, this amendment requires companies to apply qualitative and
quantitative  measures  to  determine  whether a decline  in the fair value of a
security is  other-than-temporary.  The guidance in EITF 03-1 is  effective  for
reporting  periods  beginning after June 15, 2004, with the exception of certain
sections,  which have been deferred.  Farmer Mac is evaluating the impact of the
amendment and will adopt it when it is effective in full. In the interim, Farmer
Mac continues to apply earlier authoritative accounting guidance, primarily SFAS
115 and EITF 99-20,  Recognition of Interest  Income and Impairment on Purchased
and Retained  Beneficial  Interests in  Securitized  Financial  Assets,  for the
measurement and recognition of  other-than-temporary  impairment of its debt and
equity securities.

In December 2004, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
123  (revised  2004),  Share-Based  Payment  ("SFAS  123(R)").  SFAS 123(R) is a
revision  of  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  Statement  No.  123,
Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation ("SFAS 123") and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees  ("APB 25"),  and its related
implementation  guidance.  SFAS 123(R)  requires a public  entity to measure the
cost  of  employee  services  received  in  exchange  for  an  award  of  equity
instruments  based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  That cost will be
recognized  over the period  during  which an  employee  is  required to provide
service in exchange for the award.  The grant-date  fair value of employee share
options and similar  instruments will be estimated using  option-pricing  models
adjusted  for the  unique  characteristics  of those  instruments.  SFAS  123(R)
eliminates the  alternative to use APB 25's intrinsic value method of accounting
that was provided in SFAS 123 as originally issued.  Currently,  as discussed in
Note 2(m), Farmer Mac accounts for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans
using the  intrinsic  value  method of  accounting  for employee  stock  options
pursuant to APB 25 and has adopted the  disclosure-only  provisions of SFAS 123.
The guidance in SFAS 123(R) is effective for reporting  periods  beginning after
June 15, 2005.  Farmer Mac is  evaluating  the impact of SFAS  123(R),  and will
adopt it when effective.


(q)   Reclassifications

Certain  reclassifications of prior year information were made to conform to the
2004 presentation.

3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

As provided by Farmer Mac's statutory charter,  only banks,  insurance companies
and other financial institutions or similar entities may hold Farmer Mac's Class
A voting common stock and only  institutions  of the Farm Credit System may hold
Farmer Mac's Class B voting common stock.  Farmer Mac's  statutory  charter also
provides that Class A stockholders  elect five members of Farmer Mac's 15-member
board of directors and that Class B stockholders elect five members of the board
of directors. Additionally, in order to participate in the Farmer Mac I program,
a financial  institution  must own a  requisite  amount of Farmer Mac Class A or
Class B voting common  stock,  based on the size and type of  institution.  As a
result of these requirements,  Farmer Mac conducts business with related parties
in the normal course of Farmer Mac's business.

During 2004, Farmer Mac purchased newly originated and current seasoned eligible
loans from 37 entities (the top ten  institutions  generated 82.5 percent of the
purchase  volume),  placed  loans under  LTSPCs with 18 entities  and  conducted
Farmer Mac II  transactions  with 133 entities  operating  throughout the United
States.  During 2003, Farmer Mac purchased newly originated and current seasoned
eligible loans from 48 entities (the top ten institutions generated 80.8 percent
of the  purchase  volume),  placed  loans  under  LTSPCs  with 11  entities  and
conducted Farmer Mac II transactions with 150 entities operating  throughout the
United States.

All related party transactions were conducted in the ordinary course of
business, with terms and conditions comparable to those available to any other
third party.

Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments with Related Parties:

For all of the LTSPC  transactions  discussed  below,  Farmer  Mac has a related
party  relationship  with each entity  resulting  from a member of Farmer  Mac's
board of directors being affiliated with the entity in some capacity. Farmer Mac
2004 and 2003 LTSPC activity with related parties is presented below:

The temporary  unrealized  losses presented above are principally due to changes
in interest  rates from the date of  acquisition  to December 31, 2004 and 2003.
All investment securities in unrealized loss position are at least "A" rated and
have not  experienced  any decline in credit  rating  during  2004 or 2003.  The
unrealized  losses  were on 12 and 20  individual  investment  securities  as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

As of December 31, 2004, Farmer Mac owned one  held-to-maturity  investment that
matures in 2006, with an amortized cost of $10.6 million,  a fair value of $10.9
million,  and a yield of 6.15 percent. As of December 31, 2004, Farmer Mac owned
trading investment  securities that mature after 10 years with an amortized cost
of $9.7 million,  a fair value of $9.8 million,  and a weighted average yield of

</TABLE>

As of December 31, 2004, the securities in unrealized loss positions had been in
loss positions for less than 12 months.  These temporary  unrealized  losses are
principally  due to changes in interest  rates from the date of  acquisition  to
December 31, 2004.

Of the total Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities held by Farmer Mac as of December
31, 2004,  $999.5 million are fixed-rate or have floating rates that reset after
one year.

The table below presents a sensitivity analysis for Farmer Mac's retained Farmer
Mac Guaranteed Securities as of December 31, 2004.

    Effect on fair value of a 20% adverse change   $ (36,258)
</TABLE>

These  sensitivities  are  hypothetical.  Changes  in fair  value  based on a 10
percent  variation in individual  assumptions  generally  cannot be extrapolated
because  the  relationship  of the change in  assumptions  to the change in fair
value may not be linear.  Also,  in this table the  effect of a  variation  in a
particular  assumption on the fair value of the retained  interest is calculated
without changing any other assumption. In fact, changes in one factor may result
in changes in another  (for  example,  increases  in market  interest  rates may
result  in  lower   prepayments),   which  might  amplify  or   counteract   the
sensitivities.

Farmer Mac  securitizes  two types of assets:  agricultural  mortgage  loans and
USDA-guaranteed  portions. Farmer Mac manages the credit risk of its securitized
agricultural  mortgage loans, both on- and off-balance sheet,  together with its
on-balance sheet agricultural mortgage loans and the agricultural mortgage loans
underlying  its  off-balance  sheet  LTSPCs.  See  Note 8 for  more  information
regarding this credit risk. Due to the differing  interest rate and funding risk
characteristics  of on- and off-balance sheet asset classes,  Farmer Mac manages
its  on-balance   sheet   agricultural   mortgage  loans  held  and  securitized
differently from its off-balance sheet securitized  agricultural  mortgage loans
and off-balance sheet agricultural mortgage loans underlying LTSPCs.

Farmer Mac  separately  manages its  securitized  USDA-guaranteed  portions  and
manages  those  held on its  balance  sheet  differently  from  those  that  are
off-balance  sheet - also due to their differing  interest rate and funding risk
characteristics.

As part of  fulfilling  its  guarantee  obligations  for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Securities and commitments to purchase eligible loans underlying LTSPCs,  Farmer
Mac purchases  defaulted  loans, all of which are at least 90 days delinquent at
the time of  purchase,  out of those  securities  and  pools,  and  records  the
purchased loans as such on its balance sheet.

The  table  below   presents  the   outstanding   principal   balances,   90-day
delinquencies and net credit losses as of and for the periods indicated for each
managed asset class, both on- and off-balance sheet.

6. FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES

Farmer Mac enters into financial derivative transactions  principally to protect
against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate  movements on the
value of certain assets and future cash flows or debt issuance,  not for trading
or  speculative  purposes.  Farmer Mac enters into interest rate swap  contracts
principally to adjust the  characteristics  of its short-term debt to match more
closely the cash flow and duration  characteristics of its longer-term  mortgage
and other assets,  and also to adjust the  characteristics of its long-term debt
to  match  more  closely  the  cash  flow and  duration  characteristics  of its
short-term assets,  thereby reducing interest rate risk. These transactions also
may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than would otherwise be
available  in the  conventional  debt  market.  Farmer Mac is also  required  to
recognize   certain   contracts  and   commitments  as   derivatives   when  the
characteristics  of those  contracts and  commitments  meet the  definition of a
derivative as promulgated by SFAS 133.

Market Risk:

Market risk is the risk of an adverse effect  resulting from changes in interest
rates or  spreads on the value of a  financial  instrument.  Farmer Mac  manages
market risk associated with financial derivatives by establishing and monitoring
limits  as to  the  degree  of  risk  that  may  be  undertaken.  This  risk  is
periodically measured as part of Farmer Mac's overall risk monitoring processes,
which include market value of equity measurements,  net interest income modeling
and other measures.

Credit Risk:

Credit risk is the risk that a  counterparty  will fail to perform  according to
the terms of a financial  contract in which Farmer Mac has an  unrealized  gain.
Credit losses could occur in the event of  non-performance  by counterparties to
the  financial  derivative  contracts.  Farmer Mac mitigates  this  counterparty
credit risk by contracting only with  counterparties  that have investment grade
credit ratings (i.e., at least BBB),  establishing  and  maintaining  collateral
requirements  based upon credit  ratings and entering  into netting  agreements.
Netting  agreements  provide  for  the  calculation  of the  net  amount  of all
receivables and payables under all transactions covered by the netting agreement
between  Farmer Mac and a single  counterparty.  Farmer Mac's exposure to credit
risk related to its financial derivatives is represented by those counterparties
for which Farmer Mac has a net  receivable,  including the effect of any netting
arrangements.  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,  Farmer Mac's credit  exposure,
excluding netting arrangements, was $1.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively;
however,  including  netting  arrangements,  Farmer Mac had no net  receivables.
Conversely,  financial derivatives in a net payable position required Farmer Mac
to pledge  securities  as  collateral  of  approximately  $3.2 million and $16.9
million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk:

Farmer Mac uses financial  derivatives to provide a cost- and  capital-efficient
way to manage its  interest  rate risk  exposure by modifying  the  repricing or
maturity characteristics of certain assets and liabilities and by locking in the
rates for certain  forecasted  issuances of liabilities.  The primary  financial
derivatives  Farmer  Mac uses  include  interest  rate  swaps and  forward  sale
contracts.  Farmer Mac uses  interest-rate  swaps to assume fixed rate  interest
payments  in  exchange  for  variable  rate  interest  payments  and vice versa.
Depending on the hedging  relationship,  the effects of these agreements are (a)
the  conversion  of  variable  rate   liabilities  to  longer-term   fixed  rate
liabilities,  (b) the conversion of long-term  fixed rate assets to shorter-term
variable rate assets,  or (c) the reduction of the variability of future changes
in interest rates on forecasted  issuances of  liabilities.  The net payments of
these  agreements  are charged to either  interest  expense or interest  income,
depending  on whether  the  agreement  is  designated  to hedge an  existing  or
forecasted liability or asset.

Fair Value Hedges:

Farmer Mac uses interest  rate swaps  primarily to offset the change in value of
certain  fixed rate  investments  and  liabilities  caused by  movements  in the
benchmark  interest rate (LIBOR).  In calculating  the effective  portion of the
fair  value  hedges  under SFAS 133,  the change in fair value of the  financial
derivative is recognized currently in earnings, as is the change in the value of
the hedged items  attributable  to the risk being hedged.  Accordingly,  the net
difference  or hedge  ineffectiveness,  if any, is  recognized  currently in the
consolidated  statement of operations as a gain or loss on financial derivatives
and trading assets. Fair value hedge ineffectiveness for each of the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 was not significant.

derivatives in fair value hedge relationships as of December 31, 2004:

Cash Flow Hedges:

Interest  Rate  Swaps:  Farmer  Mac  uses  interest  rate  swaps  to  hedge  the
variability  of  future  cash  flows  associated  with  existing  variable  rate
liabilities  and  forecasted  issuances  of  liabilities.  With  respect  to the
variable  rate  liabilities   (discount  notes  or  medium-term  notes)  on  its
consolidated  balance  sheet,  Farmer Mac uses  interest rate swaps to hedge the
risk of changes in the benchmark  rate  (LIBOR).  With respect to the hedging of
the  forecasted  issuance of discount  notes or  medium-term  notes,  Farmer Mac
utilizes  interest  rate  swaps  with a  longer  maturity  than  the  underlying
liabilities. The use of interest rate swap contracts with longer maturities than
the underlying  liabilities  allows Farmer Mac to hedge both the risk of changes
in the benchmark  rate (LIBOR) on existing  liabilities  and the  replacement of
such liabilities upon maturity.  These cash flow hedge relationships are treated
as  effective  hedges as long as the  future  issuances  of  liabilities  remain
probable and the hedges  continue to meet the  requirements  of SFAS 133. Farmer
Mac expects to hedge the forecasted  issuance of liabilities  over a period that
ranges from a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 15 years.

Farmer Mac measures the  ineffectiveness  of cash flow hedges in accordance with
SFAS  133  and  reports  this  amount,  if any,  as a gain or loss on  financial
derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statement of operations.  The
ineffectiveness  for each of the years ended  December 31, 2004 and 2003 was not
significant.

Basis Swaps:
Farmer  Mac uses basis  swaps to create  comparable  asset-liability  positions.
Specifically,  Farmer Mac uses  basis  swaps to hedge  combined  asset-liability
positions  in which an asset and a  liability  with  variable  cash  flows  have
different interest rate bases. Basis swaps are used to convert the interest rate
index of the asset to the same  index as the  variable  rate  liability  or vice
versa. These swaps are treated as effective hedge  relationships if the index of
one leg of the swap is the same as the  index of the  identified  asset  and the
index of the other  leg of the swap is the same as the  index of the  identified
liability.  Farmer Mac measures  ineffectiveness  for basis swaps in  accordance
with SFAS 133 and reports this amount as a gain or loss on financial derivatives
and  trading  assets  in  the   consolidated   statement  of   operations.   The
ineffectiveness  for each of the years ended  December 31, 2004 and 2003 was not
significant.

A  significant  proportion  of Farmer Mac's  outstanding  basis swaps are with a
related  party.  See Note 3 for  additional  information  on these related party
transactions.

Forward Sale Agreements and Future Contracts:
Farmer Mac uses forward sale contracts involving government-sponsored enterprise
debt instruments and mortgage backed securities and futures contracts  involving
U.S. Treasury securities to reduce the variability of future changes in interest
rates  on   forecasted   issuances   of   liabilities.   Farmer   Mac   measures
ineffectiveness   in   accordance   with  the   provisions   of  SFAS  133.  The
ineffectiveness  for each of the years ended  December 31, 2004 and 2003 was not
significant.  The  effective  portion  of the  change  in fair  value  of  these
contracts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive  income/(loss),  net of
tax. The amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive  income/(loss) will
be recognized in the statements of operations as the hedged  transactions affect
earnings.

</TABLE>

As of December  31,  2004,  Farmer Mac had  approximately  $34.4  million of net
after-tax  unrealized  losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(loss). These amounts will be reclassified into earnings in
the same  period or  periods  during  which the hedged  forecasted  transactions
(either the payment of  interest  or issuance of discount  notes or  medium-term
notes) affect earnings or immediately when it becomes probable that the original
hedged forecasted transaction will not occur within two months of the originally
specified date.

During the next 12 months,  Farmer Mac expects to reclassify  approximately $6.7
million of the net after-tax  unrealized  losses  included in accumulated  other
comprehensive income/(loss) as of December 31, 2004.

Other Financial Derivatives:

Farmer  Mac  employs  certain  hedging  strategies  that do not meet  the  hedge
accounting criteria in SFAS 133. These financial derivatives are recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value and the related changes in fair value are recognized
in the  consolidated  statements  of  operations as gains or losses on financial
derivatives and trading assets.

</TABLE>

During 2004 and 2003,  Farmer Mac called  $125.0  million  and $83.7  million of
callable medium-term notes, respectively.

Authority to Borrow from the U.S. Treasury

Farmer  Mac's  statutory  charter  authorizes  Farmer Mac to borrow,  in extreme
circumstances,  up to $1.5  billion from the U.S.  Treasury,  if  necessary,  to
fulfill its obligations  under any guarantee.  The debt would bear interest at a
rate determined by the U.S.  Treasury based on the then current cost of funds to
the  United  States.  The  charter  requires  the  debt to be  repaid  within  a
reasonable  time.  As of December  31, 2004,  Farmer Mac had not  utilized  this
borrowing  authority and does not expect to utilize this borrowing  authority in
the near future.


Gains and Losses on the Repurchase of Outstanding Debt

During 2002,  Farmer Mac recognized $1.4 million of net gains on the repurchases
of $103.7 million of outstanding  Farmer Mac debt. All of the  repurchases  were
from  outstanding  Farmer Mac debt that had a maturity  date of October 14, 2011
and an interest rate of 5.4 percent.  Those debt  securities  were replaced with
new  fixed-rate  funding to the same maturity date at lower  effective  interest
rates.

8. ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Allowance for Losses

Farmer  Mac  maintains  an  allowance  for  losses to cover  probable  estimated
principal and interest losses on all loans held and loans  underlying  post-1996
Act Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs and real estate  owned.  No
allowance  for losses has been  provided for Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities
issued  prior to the 1996 Act or for Farmer Mac II  Guaranteed  Securities.  See
Note 2(e), Note 2(j), Note 5 and Note 12 for more  information  about Farmer Mac
Guaranteed  Securities.  Farmer Mac's  allowance for losses is presented in four
components on its  consolidated  balance sheet:

     o    an "Allowance for loan losses" on loans held for investment;
     o    a valuation  allowance on real estate owned,  which is included in the
          balance sheet under "Real estate owned, net of valuation allowance";
     o    a  "Contingent  obligation  for probable  losses" on loans  underlying
          post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs  entered
          into or modified  after  January 1, 2003,  for which  inherent  losses
          existed  at the  time of the  guarantee  or  commitment  and  could be
          reasonably estimated, is included in the balance sheet as a portion of
          the amount reported as "Guarantee and commitment obligation"; and
     o    an allowance for losses on loans underlying post-1996 Act Farmer Mac I
          Guaranteed  Securities  and  LTSPCs,  which is included in the balance
          sheet under "Reserve for losses."

The  allowance  for losses is increased  through  periodic  provisions  for loan
losses that are charged  against net interest  income and  provisions for losses
that are charged to operating  expense and is reduced by charge-offs  for actual
losses, net of recoveries. Negative provisions for loan losses or provisions for
losses are recorded in the event that the estimate of probable  losses as of the
end of a period is lower  than the  estimate  at the  beginning  of the  period.
Charge-offs  represent losses on the outstanding principal balance, any interest
payments previously accrued or advanced and expected costs of liquidation.


The  following is a summary of the changes in the  allowance for losses for each
year in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004:

All loans that  Farmer Mac  purchases,  issues  guarantees  with  respect to, or
commits to purchase under an LTSPC in the Farmer Mac I program are  underwritten
for conformance to Farmer Mac's underwriting and appraisal  standards and Farmer
Mac believes the ultimate credit risk is  substantially  the same.  Accordingly,
management establishes allowances for loans held and loans underlying LTSPCs and
Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities collectively.

The following  table presents  Farmer Mac's reserve for losses for all post-1996
Act  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs on a pro rata basis as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

When certain  criteria are met, such as the default of the borrower,  Farmer Mac
may, in its sole discretion,  repurchase the defaulted loans  underlying  Farmer
Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  and is obligated to purchase  those  underlying  an
LTSPC. These acquisitions are recorded in the consolidated  financial statements
at their fair value.  Fair value is determined by appraisal or other appropriate
valuation  method.  In  September  2002,  Farmer Mac  adopted  EITF 02-9,  which
requires  that Farmer Mac record at  acquisition  the  difference  between  each
loan's  acquisition  cost and its fair value, if any, as a charge to the reserve
for losses.  Prior to the adoption of EITF 02-9, any specific allowance that had
been established for the off-balance  sheet obligation would be transferred from
the reserve for losses to the  allowance  for loan losses  (referred  to as "net
allocation of the  allowance" in the summary of the changes in the allowance for
losses).  Upon the receipt of each loan's  updated  appraisal or  estimation  of
value,  the  difference  between the  acquisition  cost of the loan and its fair
value, if any, was recorded as a charge to the allowance for loan losses.

A portion of the  allowance  for losses is  specifically  allocated  to impaired
loans when the fair value of the collateral, less the estimated selling cost, is
less than the cost basis in the loan.  For this  analysis and the  allocation of
specific reserves as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, Farmer Mac reviewed:

     o    non-performing assets;
     o    loans for which  Farmer  Mac had  adjusted  the  timing of  borrowers'
          payment  schedules  within the past three years,  but still expects to
          collect all amounts due and has not made economic concessions; and
     o    additional  performing  loans that have  previously been delinquent or
          are secured by real estate that produces  agricultural  commodities or
          products currently under stress.


The balance of impaired loans,  both on- and off-balance  sheet, and the related
allowance specifically allocated to those impaired loans as of December 31, 2004
and 2003 are summarized in the following table:

acquires  all loans that  collateralize  Farmer Mac  Guarantee  Securities  that
become and remain 90 days or more past due on the next  subsequent  loan payment
date. In accordance with the terms of all LTSPCs, Farmer Mac acquires loans that
are 120 days  delinquent  upon the  request of the  counterparty.  During  2004,
Farmer Mac  purchased  30 defaulted  loans  having a principal  balance of $12.8
million  from pools  underlying  Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities  and LTSPCs.
During 2003, Farmer Mac made 81 such purchases for a total of $55.6 million. The

The original  loan-to-value  ratio is calculated by dividing the loan  principal
balance at the time of guarantee,  purchase or commitment by the appraised value
at the date of loan origination or, when available,  updated  appraised value at
the time of guarantee, purchase or commitment.  Current loan-to-value ratios may
be higher or lower than the original loan-to-value ratios.

9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Common Stock

Farmer Mac has three classes of common stock outstanding:

     o    Class  A  voting  common  stock,  which  may be held  only  by  banks,
          insurance  companies  and  other  financial  institutions  or  similar
          entities  that are not  institutions  of the Farm  Credit  System.  By
          Federal statute, no holder of Class A voting common stock may directly
          or  indirectly  be a  beneficial  owner of more than 33 percent of the
          outstanding shares of Class A voting common stock;
     o    Class B voting common stock, which may be held only by institutions of
          the Farm  Credit  System.  There are no  restrictions  on the  maximum
          holdings of Class B voting common stock; and
     o    Class C non-voting common stock, which has no ownership restrictions.



On  October  7, 2004,  Farmer  Mac's  board of  directors  declared a  quarterly
dividend on the  Corporation's  three  classes of common  stock.  The  quarterly
dividend  of $0.10 per  common  share was paid on  December  31,  2004 to common
stockholders of record as of December 15, 2004.  Farmer Mac's ability to declare
and pay a dividend  could be restricted  if it failed to comply with  regulatory
capital requirements.

On August 4, 2004,  Farmer Mac  established  a program  to  repurchase  up to 10
percent of the  Corporation's  outstanding  Class C non-voting common stock. The
authority for this stock repurchase program expires in August 2006. During 2004,
Farmer Mac repurchased  299,248 shares of its Class C non-voting common stock at
an  average  price of $20.82  per  share.  All of the  repurchased  shares  were
purchased in open market  transactions and were retired to become authorized but
unissued shares available for future issuance.

Preferred Stock

The  Corporation  has  outstanding  700,000  shares of 6.40  percent  cumulative
preferred  stock,  Series  A,  which  has a  redemption  price  and  liquidation
preference of $50.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The preferred
stock does not have a maturity date.  Beginning on June 30, 2012, Farmer Mac has
the option to redeem the  preferred  stock at any time,  in whole or in part, at
the  redemption  price of $50.00 per share,  plus  accrued and unpaid  dividends
through and including the redemption date. Farmer Mac pays cumulative  dividends
on the preferred stock  quarterly in arrears,  when and if declared by the board
of  directors.  Farmer  Mac's  ability  to declare  and pay a dividend  could be
restricted  if it failed to comply with  regulatory  capital  requirements.  The
costs of issuing the preferred stock were charged to additional paid-in capital.


Stock Option Plan

In 1997, Farmer Mac adopted a new stock option plan for directors,  officers and
other employees to acquire shares of Class C non-voting common stock.  Under the
plan,  stock options  awarded  under the plan vest annually in thirds.  Prior to
January 2004,  the first third vested upon grant;  since January 2004, the first
third  vests one year after the date of grant.  If not  exercised,  any  options
granted under the 1997 plan will expire 10 years from the date of grant,  except
that options  issued to directors  since June 1, 1998,  if not  exercised,  will
expire five years from the date of grant. Of the 3,750,000 shares  authorized to
be issued under the 1997 plan, 2,567,201 have been issued, net of cancellations.
Options  granted  under the 1997 plan during 2004 have exercise  prices  ranging
from $19.86 to $22.11 per share.  For all stock  options  granted  under  Farmer
Mac's plan,  the  exercise  price is equal to the  closing  price of the Class C
common stock on or immediately preceding the date of grant.

The  cancellations  of stock  options  during  2004 and 2003 were due  either to
unvested options terminating in accordance with the provisions of the applicable
stock option plans upon  directors' or employees'  departures from Farmer Mac or
vested options  terminating  unexercised on their  expiration date. For 2004 and
2003 the additional paid in capital  received from the exercise of stock options
was  $1.1  million  and $3.4  million,  respectively.  During  2004 and 2003 the
reduction  of income tax paid as a result of the  deduction  for the exercise of
stock options was $0.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

The weighted-average  fair values of options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were
$7.34, $10.68 and $13.50, respectively,  which under the fair value-based method
of accounting for  stock-based  compensation  cost would have reduced net income
available to common stockholders by $1.6 million,  $2.5 million and $2.4 million
for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The fair values were estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions:

</TABLE>

Restricted Stock

In addition to stock options, the Corporation,  by authorization of the board of
directors, issued restricted stock to employees during 2003 and 2002. Restricted
stock entitles participants to all the rights of a stockholder, except that some
of the shares  awarded  are  subject to  forfeiture  if the  participant  is not
employed by Farmer Mac at the end of the restriction period and other shares are
not subject to forfeiture but may not be disposed of by the  participant  during
the restriction  period. The vesting or restriction period is usually one to two
years.  The value of restricted stock granted to employees is amortized over the
vesting  period.  Farmer Mac granted no  restricted  stock  shares  during 2004.
Farmer Mac granted  37,045 shares and 32,338  shares of restricted  stock during
2003 and 2002,  respectively,  resulting in compensation expense of $0.8 million
and $0.9 million during the respective years.


Statutory and Regulatory Capital Requirements

Farmer Mac is subject to three statutory and regulatory capital requirements:

     o    Minimum  capital - Farmer Mac's minimum  capital level is an amount of
          core capital (stockholders equity less accumulated other comprehensive
          income)  equal to the sum of 2.75  percent of Farmer  Mac's  aggregate
          on-balance sheet assets, as calculated for regulatory  purposes,  plus
          0.75 percent of the aggregate  off-balance sheet obligations of Farmer
          Mac, specifically including:
          o    the unpaid principal balance of outstanding Farmer Mac Guaranteed
               Securities;
          o    instruments   issued  or   guaranteed  by  Farmer  Mac  that  are
               substantially  equivalent  to Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,
               including LTSPCs; and
          o    other off-balance sheet obligations of Farmer Mac.
     o    Critical capital - Farmer Mac's critical capital level is an amount of
          core  capital  equal  to 50  percent  of  the  total  minimum  capital
          requirement at that time.
     o    Risk-based  capital - The Act directs  the Farm Credit  Administration
          ("FCA") to establish a risk-based  capital stress test for Farmer Mac,
          using specified stress-test parameters. While the Act does not specify
          the required level of risk-based  capital,  that level is permitted to
          exceed the statutory minimum capital requirement  applicable to Farmer
          Mac, if so indicated by the risk-based capital stress test.


Farmer  Mac is  required  to  comply  with the  higher  of the  minimum  capital
requirement or the risk-based capital requirement.

As of December 31, 2004, Farmer Mac's minimum and critical capital  requirements
were $128.9 million and $64.5 million, respectively, and its actual core capital
level was $237.7 million,  $108.8 million above the minimum capital  requirement
and $173.2 million above the critical  capital  requirement.  As of December 31,
2003, Farmer Mac's minimum and critical capital requirements were $142.0 million
and $71.0  million,  respectively,  and its actual core capital level was $215.5
million,  $73.5 million above the minimum capital requirement and $144.5 million
above the critical capital requirement.

Based on the risk-based  capital stress test,  Farmer Mac's  risk-based  capital
requirement  as of  December  31,  2004  was  $37.1  million  and  Farmer  Mac's
regulatory  capital  (core  capital  plus the  allowance  for  losses) of $254.8
million  exceeded  that amount by  approximately  $217.7  million.  Farmer Mac's
risk-based  capital  requirement  as of December 31, 2003 was $38.8  million and
Farmer  Mac's  regulatory  capital of $237.6  million  exceeded  that  amount by
approximately $198.8 million.

11. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

On December 28, 1989, Farmer Mac adopted a defined contribution  retirement plan
for all of its employees.  Through 2001,  Farmer Mac contributed 13.2 percent of
the lesser of an individual's gross salary or $170,000,  plus 5.7 percent of the
difference  between (1) the lesser of the gross  salary or $170,000  and (2) the
Social  Security   Taxable  Wage  Base.  The  Economic  Growth  and  Tax  Relief
Reconciliation  Act of 2001 increased the $170,000 limit to $200,000 in 2002, to
be adjusted  from time to time for  inflation.  Employees are fully vested after
having been employed for three years.  Expense for this plan for the years ended
December  31,  2004,  2003  and  2002  was  $537,000,   $464,000  and  $384,000,
respectively.

12. OFF-BALANCE SHEET GUARANTEES AND LTSPCs, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Farmer Mac offers approved  agricultural and rural residential  mortgage lenders
two alternatives to increase their liquidity or lending capacity while retaining
the cash flow  benefits of their loans:  (1) Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities,
which are available through either the Farmer Mac I program or the Farmer Mac II
program,  and (2)  LTSPCs,  which are  available  only  through the Farmer Mac I
program. Both of these alternatives result in off-balance sheet transactions for
Farmer Mac.

Off-Balance Sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities

Periodically Farmer Mac transfers  agricultural  mortgage loans into trusts that
are used as vehicles for the  securitization  of the transferred  assets and the
beneficial  interests in the loans are sold to third party investors.  The table
below summarizes certain cash flows received from and paid to these trusts.

Farmer Mac is liable  under its  guarantee  to ensure that the  securities  make
timely  payments to investors of principal and interest  based on the underlying
loans, regardless of whether the trust has actually received such scheduled loan
payments.  As  consideration  for Farmer Mac's  assumption of the credit risk on
these mortgage  pass-through  certificates,  Farmer Mac receives  guarantee fees
that are  recognized as earned on an accrual basis over the life of the loan and
based upon the outstanding balance of the Farmer Mac Guaranteed Security.

Farmer Mac is required to perform under its obligation when the underlying loans
for the  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities do not make their
scheduled installment payments. When a loan underlying a Farmer Mac I Guaranteed
Security  becomes  90 days  or more  past  due,  Farmer  Mac  may,  in its  sole
discretion,  repurchase  the loan from the trust and generally  does  repurchase
such loans, thereby reducing the principal balance of the outstanding Farmer Mac
I Guaranteed Security.

The  following  table  presents  the  maximum   principal  amount  of  potential
undiscounted  future  payments  that  Farmer Mac could be required to make under
off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, not including offsets provided by any recourse provisions, recoveries from
third parties or collateral for the underlying loans.

</TABLE>


If  Farmer  Mac  repurchases  a loan  that  is  collateral  for a  Farmer  Mac I
Guaranteed Security, Farmer Mac would have the right to enforce the terms of the
loan,  and in the  event of a  default,  would  have  access  to the  underlying
collateral.  Farmer Mac typically recovers a significant portion of the value of
defaulted  loans  purchased  either  through  borrower  payments,  loan payoffs,
payments by third parties or foreclosure  and sale of the property  securing the
loans.

Farmer Mac has  recourse  to the USDA for any  amounts  advanced  for the timely
payment of principal and interest on Farmer Mac II Guaranteed  Securities.  That
recourse is the USDA guarantee, a full faith and credit obligation of the United
States  that  becomes   enforceable   if  a  lender  fails  to  repurchase   the
USDA-guaranteed  portion from its owner within 30 days after written demand from
the owner when (a) the borrower under the guaranteed loan is in default not less
than  60  days  in  the  payment  of  any  principal  or  interest  due  on  the
USDA-guaranteed  portion, or (b) the lender has failed to remit to the owner the
payment made by the borrower on the USDA-guaranteed  portion or any related loan
subsidy within 30 days after the lender's receipt of the payment.

As of December 31, 2004, the  weighted-average  remaining  maturity of all loans
underlying off-balance sheet Farmer Mac Guaranteed Securities was 15.9 years. As
of  December  31,  2004 and  2003,  the  portion  of the  allowance  for  losses
attributable  to  off-balance  sheet Farmer Mac  Guaranteed  Securities was $3.0
million and $3.7 million,  respectively.  These amounts include a portion of the
reserve  for losses and the  contingent  obligation  for  probable  losses.  For
additional  detail on Farmer Mac's methodology for determining the allowance for
losses, see Note 2(j) and Note 8.

Long-Term Standby Purchase Commitments

An LTSPC is a commitment by Farmer Mac to purchase  eligible  loans,  either for
cash or in  exchange  for Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities,  on one or more
undetermined  future dates.  As  consideration  for its assumption of the credit
risk on loans underlying an LTSPC,  Farmer Mac receives a commitment fee payable
monthly  in  arrears,  in an  amount  approximating  what  would  have  been the
guarantee  fee if the  transaction  were  structured  as a swap for  Farmer  Mac
Guaranteed Securities.

An LTSPC permits a seller to nominate  from its  portfolio a segregated  pool of
loans,  which are retained in the seller's portfolio and serviced by the seller.
Upon nomination, Farmer Mac reviews the loan pool to confirm that it conforms to
Farmer  Mac's  underwriting  standards.  Upon  Farmer  Mac's  acceptance  of the
eligible loans, the seller effectively  transfers the credit risk on those loans
to Farmer Mac,  thereby  reducing the  seller's  credit and  concentration  risk
exposures and,  consequently,  its regulatory capital  requirements and its loss
reserve requirements. Credit risk is transferred through Farmer Mac's commitment
to purchase the segregated loans from the  counterparty  based upon Farmer Mac's
original credit review and acceptance of the credit risk on the loans.

The specific events or  circumstances  that would require Farmer Mac to purchase
some or all of the segregated loans under its LTSPCs include: (1) the failure of
the borrower under any loan to make  installment  payments under that loan for a
period of at least four months;  or (2) the  determination  by the holder of the
LTSPC to sell or  exchange  some or all of the  loans  under the LTSPC to Farmer
Mac.



Farmer Mac generally purchases loans subject to an LTSPC at:

     o    par  plus   accrued   interest   (if  the  loans  become  four  months
          delinquent);
     o    a  mark-to-market  price or in  exchange  for Farmer Mac I  Guaranteed
          Securities (if the loans are not  delinquent  and are standard  Farmer
          Mac loan products); or
     o    either a mark-to-market  negotiated price for all (but not some) loans
          in the pool,  based on the sale of Farmer Mac I Guaranteed  Securities
          in the capital  markets or the funding  obtained by Farmer Mac through
          the  issuance of matching debt in the capital  markets, or in exchange
          for  Farmer  Mac I  Guaranteed  Securities  (if the loans are not four
          months delinquent).

As of December  31, 2004 and 2003,  the maximum  principal  amount of  potential
undiscounted  future  payments  that Farmer Mac could be requested to make under
LTSPCs,  not including offsets provided by any recourse  provisions,  recoveries
from third parties or collateral for the underlying loans, was $2.3 billion.

In the event of loan  default,  Farmer Mac would  have the right to enforce  the
terms of the  loans  including  the  right  to  foreclose  upon  the  collateral
underlying  such loans.  Farmer Mac believes  that it will  generally  recover a
significant portion of the value of the defaulted loans purchased either through
borrower  payments,  loan payoffs,  payments by third parties or foreclosure and
sale of the collateral.

As of December 31, 2004, the  weighted-average  remaining  maturity of all loans
underlying LTSPCs was 14.5 years. The portion of the reserve for losses that was
attributable to LTSPCs was $7.8 million and $9.2 million as of December 31, 2004
and 2003,  respectively.  For additional  detail on Farmer Mac's methodology for
determining the reserve for losses, see Note 2(j) and Note 8.

Commitments

Farmer Mac enters into mandatory and optional  delivery  commitments to purchase
loans. Most loan purchase  commitments  entered into by Farmer Mac are mandatory
commitments,  in  which  Farmer  Mac  charges  a fee to  extend  or  cancel  the
commitment. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, commitments to purchase Farmer Mac
I and II loans  totaled $13.0 million and $11.2  million,  respectively,  all of
which were mandatory  commitments.  Any optional loan purchase  commitments  are
sold  forward  under  optional  commitments  to deliver  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities that may be cancelled by Farmer Mac without penalty.

Farmer Mac is exposed to interest rate risk from the time it commits to purchase
a loan to the time it either: (a) sells Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities backed
by the loan or (b) issues debt to retain the loan in its  portfolio.  There were
no commitments to sell Farmer Mac Guaranteed  Securities as of December 31, 2004
and 2003.  Farmer Mac manages the  interest  rate risk  related to loans not yet
sold  or  funded  as a  retained  investment  through  the use of  forward  sale
contracts  involving  government  sponsored  enterprise debt and mortgage-backed
securities and futures contracts  involving U.S. Treasury  securities.  See Note
2(h) and Note 6 for information regarding financial derivatives.

Rental  expense  for  Farmer  Mac's  office  space for each of the  years  ended
December  31,  2004,  2003  and 2002 was $0.6  million,  $0.5  million  and $0.5
million,  respectively.  The future  minimum lease  payments  under Farmer Mac's
non-cancelable lease for its office space and other contractual  obligations are

Other  contractual  obligations in the table above include  minimum  amounts due
under  non-cancelable   agreements  to  purchase  goods  or  services  that  are
enforceable  and  legally  binding  and specify  all  significant  terms.  These
agreements  include  agreements  for the provision of internal  audit  services,
consulting services,  information technology support, equipment maintenance, and
financial analysis software and services.  The amounts actually paid under these
agreements will likely be higher due to the variable components of some of these
agreements  under which the ultimate  obligation owed is determined by reference
to actual usage or hours worked.



13. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

The following table sets forth the estimated fair values and the carrying values
for financial assets,  liabilities and guarantees and commitments as of December
31,  2004  and  2003.  Significant  estimates,  assumptions  and  present  value
calculations are used for the following  disclosure,  resulting in a high degree
of subjectivity in the indicated fair values. Accordingly,  these estimated fair
values are not  necessarily  indicative  of what Farmer Mac would  realize in an
actual sale or purchase.

Farmer  Mac  estimates  the  fair  value of its  loans,  Farmer  Mac  Guaranteed
Securities  and notes payable by  discounting  the projected cash flows of these
instruments  at  projected  interest  rates.  Because  the  cash  flows of these
instruments  may be interest  rate path  dependent,  these values and  projected
discount rates are derived using a Monte Carlo simulation  model.  Interest rate
contracts are valued using either a similar  methodology or market  quotes.  For
investment  securities,  futures  contracts and commitments to purchase and sell
government sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage-backed securities, fair values
are based on market  quotes.  The  carrying  value of cash and cash  equivalents
approximates fair value.
