<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1. Business</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>General </I>Cincinnati Bell Inc. (&#147;the Company&#148;), f/k/a Broadwing Inc., is a
full-service local provider of data and voice communications services
and equipment and a
regional provider of wireless and long distance communications services. The
Company provides telecommunications service on its owned local and wireless
networks with a well-regarded brand name and reputation for service. The
Company operates in four business segments: Local, Wireless, Other and
Broadband.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As discussed in &#147;Item&nbsp;7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Introductory Note&#148; and Note 2 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company restated its previously
issued financial results for 2002, 2001 and 2000. During the second and third
quarters of 2003, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its
Broadband business, which is reported in the Broadband segment. These assets
were held by the Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, BRCOM (f/k/a Broadwing
Communications Inc.). Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the sale.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s primary
businesses consist of the Local and Wireless segments.
The only remaining BRCOM subsidiaries with operating assets are Cincinnati Bell
Technology Solutions Inc. (&#147;CBTS&#148;), an information technology consulting, data
collocation and managed services subsidiary, and Cincinnati Bell Any Distance
(&#147;CBAD&#148;), a subsidiary whose assets service the Other segment&#146;s long distance
business. In addition to the long distance business, the Other segment also
includes Cincinnati Bell Public Communications Inc. (&#147;Public&#148;), a public
payphone service provider.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition to the sale of
substantially all of the broadband assets, on June&nbsp;13, 2003 the Company&#146;s subsidiaries entered
into agreements with the buyer of the broadband assets whereby the Company will
continue to market Broadwing Communications LLC&#146;s (&#147;Broadwing&#148;) (f/k/a C III
Communications LLC) broadband products to business customers and purchase
capacity on the Broadwing Communications LLC national network in order to
sell long distance services, under the CBAD brand, to residential and business
customers in the Greater Cincinnati area market. For these marketing efforts,
Broadwing pays Cincinnati Bell Telephone (&#147;CBT&#148;) a commission, which CBT
recognizes as revenue. Prior to the sale, CBT recognized the customer-invoiced
amount as revenue and the related costs of providing service. For results prior
to June&nbsp;13, 2003 the Company has recast the Local segment and Broadband segment
results as if Broadwing had paid the difference between the historical invoiced
amount of revenue less related costs of providing service as commission
revenue.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Although the Company operates in distinct business segments, it markets the
services of all of its Cincinnati-based segments in bundled packages. In the
first quarter of 2003, the Company introduced Custom Connections<SUP>SM</SUP>, which
enables consumers and small businesses to assemble a customized package of
local, long distance, wireless and digital subscriber line (&#147;DSL&#148;) services
on a single monthly bill. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2003 the Company had approximately
71,000 subscribers to this comprehensive bundling package, which

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Local segment provides local telephone service, network access, data
transport, high-speed and dial-up Internet access, inter-lata toll,
telecommunications equipment, installation and maintenance and other
ancillary products and services to customers primarily in southwestern Ohio,
northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. This market consists of
approximately 2,400 square miles located within approximately a 25-mile radius
of Cincinnati, Ohio. Services are provided through the Company&#146;s CBT
subsidiary, which has operated as the incumbent local exchange carrier (&#147;ILEC&#148;)
in the Greater Cincinnati area for the past 130&nbsp;years.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Local segment produced $820.4&nbsp;million, $833.1&nbsp;million and $824.7
million, or 53%, 38%, and 37%, of consolidated Company revenue in 2003, 2002,
and 2001, respectively. The Local segment produced consolidated operating
income of $296.1&nbsp;million, $285.3&nbsp;million and $266.5&nbsp;million in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBT&#146;s service offerings are generally classified into three
major categories: local service, network access, including DSL
transport, and other services. Local
service revenue is primarily from end-user charges for use of the public
switched telephone and data network and for value-added services such as custom
calling features. These services are provided to business and residential
customers and represented 57% of CBT&#146;s revenue in 2003. Network
access represented 25% of CBT&#146;s revenue in 2003 and was
generated by service provided to interexchange carriers
for access to CBT&#146;s local communications network, business customers for
customized access arrangements and end user customers for access to long
distance networks. Other services provided the remaining 18% of CBT&#146;s revenue
in 2003 and consisted of the sale and installation of telecommunications
equipment, Internet access, commissions from the sale of broadband services, inside wire installation and
maintenance and other ancillary services.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBT&#146;s network access revenue
includes special access, switched access and
end user common line revenue. CBT&#146;s special access revenue accounted for 47%
of network access revenue in 2003. Special access revenue was $95.5&nbsp;million,
$97.5&nbsp;million and $94.3&nbsp;million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Special
access pricing is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (&#147;FCC&#148;),
which requires annual mandated price reductions equal to inflation, net of a
6.5% productivity offset. Over the past three years, the FCC mandated special
access pricing decreases of approximately 5% each year. However, in accordance
with Coalition for Affordable Local and Long Distance Service (&#147;CALLS&#148;), CBT
will not be required to lower its special access rates on July&nbsp;1, 2004.
CBT&#146;s switched access revenue accounted for 20% of network access revenue in
2003. Switched access revenue was $40.4&nbsp;million, $39.0&nbsp;million and $42.6
million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. End user common line (&#147;EUCL&#148;)
revenue accounted for 33% of network access revenue in 2003. EUCL revenue
totaled $66.5&nbsp;million, $67.6&nbsp;million and $68.4&nbsp;million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBT provides voice services over a circuit switch-based network of 47 host
switches and 40 optical remote switch modules serving customers in 56 wire
centers. In addition, CBT has successfully leveraged its embedded network
investment to provide value&#150;added services and product bundling packages,
resulting in additional

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">revenue with minimal incremental costs. All of the network access lines
subscribed to CBT are served by digital switches and have the integrated
services digital network (&#147;ISDN&#148;) and Signaling System 7 capability necessary
to support enhanced features such as Caller ID, Call Waiting and Call Return. The
network also includes approximately 3,500 route miles of fiber-optic cable,
with synchronous optical network (&#147;SONET&#148;) rings linking Cincinnati&#146;s downtown
with other area business centers. These SONET rings offer increased
reliability and redundancy to CBT&#146;s major business customers. CBT has deployed
DSL capable electronics in over 252 locations throughout its territory,
allowing it to offer DSL services to over 86% of its subscriber base. CBT also
has an extensive business-oriented data network, offering native speed Ethernet
services over an interlaced asynchronous transfer mode (&#147;ATM&#148;) &#150; Gigabit
Ethernet backbone network.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBT markets and resells telecommunications equipment to business customers
primarily in its local service area. CBT also provides installation services
and resells maintenance contracts related to this equipment. Equipment sales,
installation and maintenance revenue totaled $46.9&nbsp;million, $54.4&nbsp;million and
$46.0&nbsp;million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In order to maintain its network, CBT relies on supplies from certain key
external vendors and a variety of other sources. Since the majority of CBT&#146;s
revenue results from use of the public switched telephone network, its
operations follow no particular seasonal pattern. CBT&#146;s franchise area is
granted under regulatory authority, and is subject to increasing competition
from a variety of companies. CBT is not aware of any regulatory initiative
that would restrict the franchise area in which it is currently able to
operate. A significant portion of revenue is derived from pricing plans that
require regulatory overview and approval. In recent years, these regulated
pricing plans have resulted in decreasing or fixed rates for some services,
partially offset by price increases and enhanced flexibility for other
services.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, approximately 46 companies were certified to
offer telecommunications services in CBT&#146;s local franchise area and had
interconnection agreements with CBT. In November&nbsp;2003, Time Warner Cable filed
an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to provide local
and interexchange voice service in several market areas including Cincinnati
and is expected to begin competing for residential and business customers in
mid-2004. In March&nbsp;2004, the local gas and electric supplier announced that it
would begin offering high-speed Internet access over electrical lines to
customers in CBT&#146;s operating area. CBT seeks to maintain an advantage over
these competitors through its service quality, network capabilities and reach,
innovative products and services, creative marketing and product bundling,
various customer billing alternatives and value pricing.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBT had approximately 986,000 network access lines in service on December&nbsp;31,
2003, a 2.6% and 4.5% reduction in comparison to 1,012,000 and 1,032,000 access
lines in service at December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Approximately
69% of CBT&#146;s network access lines serve residential customers and 31% serve
business customers. Despite the decline in access lines, the Company has been
able to nearly offset the effect of these losses on revenue by increasing DSL
penetration. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, CBT had approximately 100,000 ZoomTown
DSL subscribers, a 33% and 64% increase in comparison to 75,000 and 61,000
subscribers at December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2003, DSL service was
available to approximately 86% of the network access lines served by the
Company, which the company refers to as addressable access lines. Of the
addressable access lines, the Company&#146;s consumer penetration was 14.9% at the
end of 2003, an increase of four percentage points from 10.9% at the end of
2002. Business penetration of addressable lines has grown to 6.5% at end of
2003, up more than one percentage point from 5.3% penetration at the end of
2002. On a combined basis, subscribership of nearly 100,000 represents 12.6%
penetration of addressable lines, compared to 9.3% penetration at the end of
2002.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In March&nbsp;2004, the
Company upgraded its DSL network
to provide higher speed internet access &#150; up to four times faster than the
existing DSL network and which is comparable to speeds provided by other
high-speed internet competitors.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Wireless</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Wireless segment includes the operations of Cincinnati Bell Wireless
LLC (&#147;CBW&#148;), a joint venture with AT&#038;T Wireless Services (&#147;AWE&#148;), in which the
Company owns 80.1% and AWE owns the remaining 19.9%. The Wireless segment
provides advanced digital, voice and data communications services on its own
regional wireless network in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio and on the AWE
national wireless network. CBW offers digital wireless service to postpaid
customers, who pay a monthly access fee and usage fees in arrears.
Prepaid customers purchase minutes or text messages, in advance, at a fixed
price. The segment also sells related telecommunications equipment.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBW&#146;s digital wireless network operates on 30 MHz of wireless spectrum, of
which CBW owns a license for 20MHz in Cincinnati and Dayton, and leases 10MHz
licensed to the Company in Cincinnati and 10MHz licensed to AWE in Dayton. Its
network consists of switching, messaging and radio base station equipment
attached to 287 tower and rooftop structures, which CBW owns or leases from
other providers. The network employs both Time Division Multiple Access
(&#147;TDMA&#148;) and Global System for Mobile Communications and General Packet Radio
Service (&#147;GSM/GPRS&#148;) technology. TDMA provides both voice and short message
service (&#147;SMS&#148;) data services. In October&nbsp;2003, CBW deployed the GSM/GPRS
technology, which provides, in addition to voice communication and SMS,
enhanced wireless data communication services, such as mobile web browsing,
internet access, email and picture messaging. The GSM/GPRS is EDGE compatible,
requiring only software upgrades to deliver higher data rates and capacity. As
handsets of one technology cannot generally be used on the network of the other
technology, CBW plans to operate both technologies simultaneously until its
TDMA customer base naturally churns or migrates to GSM/GPRS service. Based on
current estimates, the Company expects that it will operate its TDMA network at
least through 2006.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBW&#146;s operating territory includes a licensed population (&#147;licensed pops&#148;) of
approximately 3.4&nbsp;million. As of December 31, 2003, CBW served approximately 474,000 subscribers, of
which 312,000 were postpaid subscribers and 162,000 were prepaid, i-wireless<SUP>SM</SUP>
subscribers, representing a licensed pop penetration
of 13.9%. In May of 1998 CBW became the fifth wireless carrier to enter the
Cincinnati and Dayton market. CBW estimates its market share totaled
approximately 26% as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, based on a total wireless industry
penetration rate of 54%. Postpaid declined by 700 subscribers during 2003.
CBW maintained an average monthly churn rate of 1.8%, 1.7% and 1.6% for
postpaid customers in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively and an average monthly
churn rate of 4.9%, 4.7% and 3.3% for prepaid customers in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Wireless local number portability (&#147;WLNP&#148;), which was mandated
by the FCC and became effective November&nbsp;24, 2003, has had an immaterial impact
on CBW.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2003 and 2002, services generated approximately 95% of the
Wireless segment&#146;s revenue whereas equipment sales generated the remaining
5%. This composition of revenue compares to approximately 94% and 6%,
respectively, in 2001. In total, the Wireless segment contributed $259.5,
$267.2 and $254.4, or 17%, 12% and 11% of consolidated revenue in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. The Wireless segment produced $60.2&nbsp;million, $69.1
million and $37.7&nbsp;million in operating income in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Postpaid subscribers generate approximately 78% of total service revenue
through a variety of rate plans, which typically include a fixed or unlimited
number of minutes for a flat monthly rate, with additional minutes for fixed
number of minute plans being charged at a per-minute-of-use rate. Prepaid
i-wireless<SUP>SM</SUP> subscribers generate 15% of service revenue whereas subscribers of
other telecommunications providers, mainly AWE, generate the remaining 7%

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">of service revenue. CBW incurs significant roaming expenses when its own
wireless subscribers use their handsets on the networks of other wireless
providers. CBW&#146;s roaming expense of $33.2&nbsp;million, $35.4&nbsp;million and $34.4
million exceeded its roaming revenue of $16.6&nbsp;million, $17.5&nbsp;million and $15.5
million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Sales of handsets and accessories take place primarily at CBW&#146;s retail
locations, which consist of stores and kiosks in high-traffic shopping malls
and commercial buildings in the Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio areas.
Sales also take place in the retail stores of major electronic retailers
pursuant to agency agreements. CBW sells handsets and accessories from a
variety of vendors. CBW maintains a supply of equipment and does not envision
any shortages that would compromise its ability to add customers. Unlike
service revenue (which is a function of wireless handset usage), equipment
sales are seasonal in nature, as customers often purchase handsets and
accessories as gifts during the holiday season in the Company&#146;s fourth quarter.
In order to attract customers, CBW typically sells handsets for less than
direct cost, a common practice in the wireless industry.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As the wireless venture is jointly owned with AWE, income or losses
generated by the Wireless segment are shared between the Company and AWE in
accordance with respective ownership percentages of 80.1% for the Company and
19.9% for AWE. As a result, 19.9% of the net income or loss of the Wireless
segment is reflected as minority interest expense or income in the Company&#146;s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Refer
to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed
discussion of AWE&#146;s minority interest in this venture.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Wireless Management</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBW is an Ohio limited liability company. The Company owns its 80.1% interest
in CBW through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Cincinnati Bell Wireless
Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. AWE owns its 19.9% interest
through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, AT&#038;T Wireless PCS LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company. Its operating agreement, governs among other things,
the ownership, cash distributions, capital contributions and management of CBW.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The CBW operating agreement provides that a five member committee govern CBW,
with AWE having the right to appoint two representatives and the Company having
the right to appoint three representatives. Matters requiring the approval by a
majority of the representatives include, without limitation, the adoption of
any budget, or any business, marketing, financial, operational, strategic or
any other material plan, policy or strategy which is expected to materially
affect the operations of CBW; the hiring or firing of any key personnel;
material contracts; commencing or settling material claims; capital calls; any
transaction or other activities which could reasonably be expected to result in
the financial performance of CBW materially diverging from the then current
budget, business or other plan; and incurring debt.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, as long as AWE holds an interest of at least 15% or has not sold,
assigned or otherwise transferred any of its equity interests, the vote of at
least two-thirds of the representatives of the member committee is required for
the sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of all or
substantially all of CBW&#146;s assets or of any asset that can reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse impact on CBW; the merger or consolidation
of CBW or the direct or indirect purchase or acquisition of another entity; the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>License Agreements</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AWE and CBW are parties to several commercial agreements governing their
relationship. For instance, both AWE and the Company license their respective
brand names to CBW under the terms of license agreements.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Roaming Agreements</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For TDMA roaming, AWE and CBW are parties to two roaming agreements; the first
runs through 2018 and allows the subscribers of each party to roam on the
other&#146;s networks, and the second is a year-to-year agreement, which allows CBW
subscribers to roam on other carriers&#146; networks as an affiliate of AWE. GSM
roaming on each other&#146;s networks is covered by a separate agreement, which runs
through October&nbsp;2005 and is month-to-month after October&nbsp;2005. CBW also has
entered into GSM roaming agreements with other foreign and domestic carriers
and expects to enter into other GSM roaming agreements in the future.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Spectrum Leasing</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition to spectrum licensed directly to CBW itself, CBW has the ability to
use additional spectrum licensed to either AWE or the Company. CBW uses AWE&#146;s
10MHz of A-Block spectrum in Dayton. The use agreement runs through April
2007 and has a right-of-first refusal for CBW to purchase the spectrum license
if AWE desires to transfer it to a third-party, unless the spectrum is
transferred in a transaction in which the A-Block spectrum represents less than
3% of the total value of the overall transaction. CBW also uses the Company&#146;s
10 MHz of E-Block spectrum in the Cincinnati market. This use agreement runs
through March&nbsp;2010.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Wireless Limitations on Transfer or Encumbrance</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As summarized below, the CBW operating agreement contains certain limitations
on the ability of AWE or the Company to transfer, directly or indirectly, their
interest in CBW. Pursuant to the CBW operating agreement, any sale of AWE
would be considered a transfer of interest in CBW subject to the transfer
limitations described herein.

The Other segment revenue constituted approximately 5%, 4% and 4% of

produced operating income of $6.5&nbsp;million and $1.7&nbsp;million in 2003 and 2002,
respectively, and an operating loss of $3.7&nbsp;million in 2001.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Cincinnati Bell Any Distance

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBAD primarily resells long distance services to businesses and residential
customers in the Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio areas. At December&nbsp;31,
2003, CBAD had approximately 539,000 subscribers in comparison to 555,000 and
550,000 long distance subscribers at December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
With regard to Local segment access lines for which a long distance carrier is
chosen, CBAD&#146;s market share within the greater Cincinnati area increased in
2003, with residential and business market share growing to approximately 71%
and 45%, respectively, from 69% and 43%, respectively, at the end of 2002. Of
CBT&#146;s 986,000 access lines in the greater Cincinnati area, approximately
407,000 residential access lines and 118,000 business access lines subscribed
to &#147;Any Distance&#148; as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. In 2003, CBAD produced $68.2&nbsp;million
in revenue for the Other segment, representing approximately 4% of consolidated
revenue compared to $68.8&nbsp;million and 3% of consolidated revenue in 2002 and
$63.6&nbsp;million and 3% of consolidated revenue in 2001.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Cincinnati Bell Public
Communications Inc.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Public provides public payphone services to customers in a regional area
consisting of thirteen states. Public had approximately 8,100, 7,700 and 9,200
stations in service and generated approximately $12.8&nbsp;million, $13.7&nbsp;million
and $15.4&nbsp;million in revenue in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, or less than
1% of consolidated revenue in each year. The revenue decrease is a result of
reduced calls per line caused by continued penetration of wireless
communications and a targeted reduction in unprofitable lines.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Broadband</I>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As discussed above, on February&nbsp;22, 2003, certain of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries
entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the operating
assets of the Broadband segment, excluding the information technology (&#147;IT&#148;)
consulting assets, for up to $129&nbsp;million in cash and the assumption of certain
long-term operating contractual commitments. On June&nbsp;6, 2003 and June&nbsp;13,
2003, the purchase agreement was amended to, among other things, reduce the
initial purchase price to $108.7&nbsp;million (an estimated $91.5&nbsp;million in cash and $17.2
million preliminary working capital promissory note, which was ultimately
reduced to zero based on the final working capital position of the broadband
business). The buyer paid the initial cash purchase price of $91.5&nbsp;million, of which
$29.3&nbsp;million was placed into escrow to support certain potential purchase
price adjustments and the remaining purchase price payable. On June&nbsp;13,
2003, the Company effectively transferred control of the broadband business to
the buyer. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
144 (&#147;SFAS 144&#148;), the Company ceased depreciating the assets to be sold upon
entering into the definitive agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Broadband revenue was $448.7&nbsp;million,
$1,075.4&nbsp;million and $1,169.6&nbsp;million, or 29%, 49% and 52% of consolidated
revenue in 2003, 2002, 2001, respectively. Broadband generated operating
income of $348.6&nbsp;million in 2003, or 51% of consolidated operating income, and
operating losses of $2,437.6&nbsp;million and $547.9&nbsp;million in 2002 and 2001,
respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Subsequent to the closing of the asset sale, the Broadband segment
consists of CBTS, an information technology consulting, data collocation and
managed services business, and certain liabilities not assumed by the buyers.
Prior to the sale of the broadband assets, revenue for the Broadband segment
was generated from broadband transport (which included non-cash revenue from
indefeasible right of use agreements (&#147;IRU&#146;s&#148;)), switched voice services, data
and Internet services (including data collocation and managed services),
information technology consulting and other services. These transport and
switched voice services were generally provided over BRCOM&#146;s national optical
network, which comprised approximately 18,700 route miles of fiber-optic
transmission facilities. Due to the sale of the broadband business, the Company
expects Broadband segment revenue related to broadband transport and switched
voice services to be zero going forward.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">




<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In the second half of 2003, the Broadband segment included only the
revenue of the Company&#146;s CBTS subsidiary, which contributed revenue of $116.8
million in 2003, consisting of $64.9&nbsp;million of equipment hardware sales, $30.4
million of IT consulting services and $21.5&nbsp;million of data collocation and managed
services. In 2002, CBTS contributed revenue of $163.9&nbsp;million consisting of
$113.4&nbsp;million of equipment hardware sales, $30.3&nbsp;million of IT consulting services and
$20.2&nbsp;million of data collocation and managed services.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Broadband transport services consisted of long-haul transmission of data, voice
and Internet traffic over dedicated circuits. Revenue from the broadband
transport category was primarily generated by private line monthly recurring
revenue. However, approximately 36%, 44% and 29% of the broadband transport
revenue in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, was provided by IRU agreements,
which cover a fixed period of time and represent the lease of capacity or
network fibers. The buyer of IRU services typically pays cash or other
consideration upon execution of the contract. The Company&#146;s policy and
practice was to amortize these payments into revenue over the life of the
contract. In the event the buyer of an IRU terminated a contract prior to the
contract expiration and released the Company from the obligation to provide
future services, the remaining unamortized unearned revenue was recognized in
the period in which the contract was terminated. Broadband transport services
produced 36%, 43% and 40% of Broadband segment revenue in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Switched voice services consisted of billed minutes of use, primarily for the
transmission of voice long distance services on behalf of both wholesale and
retail customers. Switched voice services provided 25%, 31% and 33% of
Broadband segment revenue in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Network construction and other services consisted of large, joint-use network
construction projects. The Company typically gained access to rights-of-way or
additional fiber routes through its network construction activities. In
November&nbsp;2001, the Company announced its intention to exit the network
construction business upon completion of one remaining contract as discussed in
Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. That contract to
build a fiber route system was in dispute before the interested parties reached
a final settlement in February&nbsp;2004 as discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>BUSINESS OUTLOOK</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">There is substantial competition in the telecommunications industry.
Competition may intensify due to the efforts of existing competitors to address
difficult market conditions through reduced pricing, bundled offerings or
otherwise, as well as a result of the entrance of new competitors and the
development of new technologies, products and services. If the Company cannot
offer reliable, value-added services on a price competitive basis in any of its
markets, it could be adversely impacted by competitive forces. In addition, if
the Company does not keep pace with technological advances or fails to respond
timely to changes in competitive factors in the industry, the Company could
lose market share or experience a decline in revenue and profit margins.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Excluding the Broadband segment, the Company expects revenue to decline in the
low single-digits compared to 2003, and operating income to be in the range of $295
million to $310&nbsp;million, as a result of higher sales and marketing expense
related to the Company defending its market position through incremental wireless and DSL customer acquisitions particularly into
service bundles that include an access line. In support of these expectations,
in February&nbsp;2004 the Company launched an aggressive marketing campaign titled
&#147;You Add, We Subtract&#148;, designed to promote further bundled suites of
communications services on a single bill for a reduced flat monthly fee. The
Company also expects greater depreciation expense related to shortening the
estimated depreciable life of its TDMA network assets to the end of 2006. The Company
expects capital expenditures to remain at approximately 10% to 12% of future
revenue.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has substantial state and federal operating loss tax carryforwards.
As a result, the Company expects cash payments of less than $5&nbsp;million related to income taxes in
2004. The Company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 50%.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBT faces competition from other local exchange carriers, wireless services
providers, interexchange carriers, cable and satellite providers and Internet
service providers. The Company believes CBT will face greater

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">




<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">competition as more competitors emerge and focus resources on the Greater
Cincinnati metropolitan area. In November&nbsp;2003, Time Warner Cable filed an
application with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to provide local and
interexchange voice service in several market areas in Ohio, including
Cincinnati, and expects to begin offering residential service in 2004. In
March&nbsp;2004, the local gas and electric supplier announced that it would begin
offering high-speed Internet access over electrical lines to customers in CBT&#146;s
operating area. Also, the emerging voice over internet protocol
(&#147;VoIP&#148;)
providers offering service in other areas of the country may begin offering
service in CBT&#146;s operating territory.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBW is one of six active wireless service providers in the Cincinnati and
Dayton, Ohio metropolitan market areas, including Cingular, Sprint PCS,
T-Mobile, Verizon and Nextel, all of which are nationally known and well
funded. The Company anticipates that continued competition will likely
continue to cause the market prices for wireless products and services to
decline in the future. CBW&#146;s ability to compete will depend, in part, on its
ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the
telecommunications industry. Furthermore, as evidenced by AWE&#146;s recent
announcement that it has agreed to be acquired by Cingular, there has been a
trend in the wireless communications industry towards consolidation
through joint ventures, reorganizations and acquisitions.
The Company expects this consolidation to lead to larger competitors with
greater resources and more service offerings than CBW. At this time it is not
completely clear what impact the Cingular/AWE merger will have on the
operations of CBW or on Cingular&#146;s/AWE&#146;s desire to remain in the CBW venture.
However, CBW&#146;s implementation of GSM/GPRS should improve the Company&#146;s ability
to compete through preservation and enhancement of existing revenue streams,
lower incremental capital expenditures per gross subscriber addition, lower
network cost per minute of use, and minimal additional investment in the legacy
TDMA network.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s other subsidiaries operate in a largely local or regional area,
and each of these subsidiaries faces significant competition. CBAD&#146;s
competitors include resellers, competitive local exchange providers and large
national long distance carriers such as AT&#038;T Corp., MCI and Sprint Corporation,
in addition to emerging VoIP providers. Public competes with several other
public payphone providers, some of which are national in scope and offer lower
prices for coin-based local calling services. Public has also continued to be
adversely impacted by the growing penetration of wireless communications.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">BRCOM&#146;s CBTS subsidiary competes against numerous other information technology
consulting, computer system integration and managed-service providers, many of
which are larger, national in scope and better financed.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company intends to continue to utilize its investment in its local wireline
communications network and its regional wireless network to provide new and
incremental product and service offerings to its customers in the Greater
Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio markets and utilize its well-regarded brand name to
enter new markets near its current operating territory.

subsidiaries will be prohibited from paying such dividends or making other
distributions to the Company for up to 179&nbsp;days after the credit facilities&#146;

subsidiaries are subject to debt obligations or
regulatory issues that potentially restrict their ability to distribute funds

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the Company&#146;s inability to
comply with the required financial ratios and financial results could result in
a default under the credit facilities. If a default occurs, the lenders under
the credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together
with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. The
lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any
commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Additionally, the
Company&#146;s debt instruments contain cross-acceleration
provisions, which generally cause
each instrument to accelerate upon a qualifying acceleration of any other debt
instrument.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>The Company operates in a highly competitive industry and its customers may not
continue to purchase services, which could result in reduced revenue and loss
of market share.</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">There is substantial competition in the telecommunications industry.
Competition may intensify due to the efforts of existing or new competitors to
address difficult market conditions through reduced pricing, bundled offerings
or otherwise, as well as a result of the entrance of new competitors and the
development of new technologies, products and services. If the Company cannot
offer reliable, value-added services on a price-competitive basis in any of its
markets, it could be adversely impacted by competitive forces. In addition, if
the Company does not keep pace with technological advances or fails to respond
timely to changes in competitive factors in the industry, it could lose market
share or experience a decline in its revenue and profit margins.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Maintaining the Company&#146;s networks requires significant capital expenditures
and its inability or failure to maintain its networks would have a material
impact on its market share and ability to generate revenue.</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, capital expenditures totaled $126
million. The Company may incur significant additional capital expenditures
as a result of unanticipated expenses, regulatory
changes and other events that impact the business. If the Company is unable or
fails to adequately maintain or expand its networks to meet customer needs,
there could be a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s market share and its
ability to generate revenue.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Maintenance of CBW&#146;s wireless network, growth in the wireless business or the
addition of new wireless products and services may require CBW to obtain
additional spectrum, which may not be available or be available only on less
than favorable terms.</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The TDMA wireless network currently operates on spectrum, which the FCC has
licensed to CBW. For its GSM network, CBW uses spectrum licensed to the
Company or to AWE. Introduction of new wireless products and services, as well
as maintenance of the existing wireless business, may require CBW to obtain
additional spectrum in the Cincinnati or Dayton markets, either to supplement
or to replace the existing spectrum. There can be no assurance that such
spectrum will be available to CBW, or will be available on commercially
favorable terms. Failure to obtain any needed new spectrum or to retain
existing spectrum could have a materially adverse impact on the wireless
business as a whole, the quality of the wireless networks, and the ability to
offer new competitive products and services.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>The regulation of the businesses by federal and state authorities may, among
other things, place the Company at a competitive disadvantage, restrict its
ability to price its products and services and threaten its operating licenses.</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Several of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries are subject to regulatory oversight of
varying degrees at both the state and federal levels. Pricing plans that
require regulatory overview and approval produce a significant portion of CBT&#146;s
revenue. Different interpretations by regulatory bodies may result in
adjustments to revenue in future periods. In recent years, these regulated
pricing plans have resulted in decreasing or fixed rates for some services. In
the future, regulatory initiatives that would put CBT at a competitive
disadvantage or mandate lower rates for its services could result in lower
profitability and cash flow for the Company.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">At the federal level, CBT is subject to the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
including the rules subsequently adopted by the FCC to implement the 1996 Act,
which the Company expects to impact Cincinnati Bell Telephone&#146;s in-territory
local exchange operations in the form of greater competition.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">At the state level, CBT conducts local exchange operations in portions of Ohio,
Kentucky and Indiana and, consequently, is subject to regulation by the Public
Utilities Commissions in those states. In Ohio, the Public Utility Commission
has concluded a proceeding to establish permanent rates that CBT can charge to
competitive local exchange carriers for unbundled network elements, although
some elements will remain subject to interim rates indefinitely. The Kentucky
commission recently initiated a similar case to establish rates for unbundled
network elements in Kentucky. The establishment of these rates is intended to
facilitate market entry by competitive local exchange carriers. CBT is also
subject to an Alternative Regulation&nbsp;Plan in Ohio. The current plan gives CBT
pricing flexibility in several competitive service categories in exchange for
its commitment to freeze certain basic residential service rates during the
term of the plan. The term of the current plan will expire on June&nbsp;30, 2004.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBW&#146;s FCC licenses to provide wireless services are subject to renewal and
revocation. Although the FCC has routinely renewed wireless licenses in the
past, the Company cannot be assured that challenges will not be

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">brought against those licenses in the future. Revocation or non-renewal of
CBW&#146;s licenses would result in lower operating results and cash flow for the
Company.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">There are currently many regulatory actions under way and being contemplated by
federal and state authorities regarding issues that could result in significant
changes to the business conditions in the telecommunications industry.
Changes in current or future regulations adopted by
the FCC, or state regulators, or other legislative, administrative, or judicial
initiatives relating to the telecommunications industry, could have a
material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the financial
markets and the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Terrorist attacks may negatively affect the Company&#146;s operations and financial
condition. There can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist
attacks against the United States of America, U.S. businesses or armed conflict
involving the United States of America. Further terrorist attacks or other
acts of violence or war may directly impact the Company&#146;s physical facilities
or those of its customers and vendors. These events could cause consumer
confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the
United States and world financial markets and economy. They could result in an
economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences
could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>The Company expects to experience significant change in the wireless
communications industry.</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The wireless communications industry is experiencing technological change.
This includes digital upgrades, evolving industry standards, ongoing
improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter
development cycles for new products and changes in customer needs and
preferences. CBW currently offers its services over a digital wireless network
using Time Division Multiple Access, or TDMA, technology. In October&nbsp;2003, the
Company implemented GSM/GPRS technology, which several competitors, as well as
the Company&#146;s wireless partner AWE, have already implemented. This new
technology is currently running concurrent with the TDMA technology and will
continue to do so through at least December&nbsp;31, 2006 under the Company&#146;s
current estimates. However, the prospects of the Company&#146;s wireless business
will depend on the success of its conversion to GSM/GPRS technology and its
ability to anticipate and adapt to future changes in the wireless
communications industry.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>The purchase of AWE by Cingular Wireless could have a significant impact on the
composition and operations of our wireless subsidiary.</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AWE announced in February&nbsp;2004 that it agreed to be purchased by Cingular
Wireless. AWE owns 19.9% of CBW, which comprises the substantial portion of
the Wireless segment. In connection with the sale, Cingular/AWE announced
their intention to accelerate their migration away from TDMA technology. In
addition to being a part owner of CBW, AWE provides roaming services for TDMA
and GSM, and allows CBW to use spectrum, under the terms of various commercial
agreements. The parties also have reciprocal non-competition obligations (as
specified in the operating agreement between the Company and AWE). At this
time it is not completely clear what impact the Cingular/AWE merger will have
on the operations of CBW or on Cingular&#146;s/AWE&#146;s desire to remain in the CBW
venture. However, a decision by Cingular/AWE to exit or limit its involvement
in CBW, or to not renew the commercial roaming and spectrum use arrangements
beyond their current terms could have a material impact on the business unless
CBW were able to obtain alternative commercial arrangements on commercially
reasonable terms. In addition, it is unclear whether a decision by Cingular/AWE
to accelerate their migration away from TDMA would impact the schedule of the
Company&#146;s

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">own TDMA migration. The Company currently anticipates completing its migration
by the end of 2006. An acceleration before then could require additional
capital expenditures, costs, expenses and asset impairments and could result in
the loss of revenue.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of
the environment and health and human safety.</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment and health and human safety, including those
governing the management and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials
and the cleanup of contamination, and the emission of radio frequency. While
the Company believes its operations are in substantial compliance with
environmental and health and human safety laws and regulations, as an owner or
operator of property and in connection with the current and historical use of
hazardous materials, underground storage tanks and other operations at its
sites, the Company could incur significant costs resulting from violations or
liabilities under such laws, the imposition of cleanup obligations, and
third-party suits.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>The Company&#146;s share price may be volatile.</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s share price may fluctuate substantially as a result of periodic
variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the Company&#146;s
business or other companies in the telecommunications industry or markets
served by the Company. In addition, the stock market has experienced price and
volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many
telecommunications stocks and have often been unrelated or disproportionate to
the operating performance of some of these companies. Fluctuations such as
these have affected and are likely to continue to affect the share price of the
Company&#146;s common stock. In addition, many of the risks described in this
section could materially and adversely affect the Company&#146;s share price.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During 2002 and 2003, a number of putative class action and derivative lawsuits
were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers
and directors. Additionally, the Audit Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of
Directors completed an investigation into allegations that were contained in an
amended class action securities lawsuit filed in December&nbsp;2003. In connection
with that investigation, adjustments have been identified related to the manner
that the Company recorded a particular broadband network construction agreement
entered into in 2000. These adjustments related to the timing of revenue
recognition resulting from the inappropriate inclusion of certain costs that
had not been fully incurred and use of estimates regarding the extent to which
the construction contract had been completed. The Company restated its
financial statements to reflect the revised accounting for this contract. In
investigating plaintiffs&#146; other allegations, the Audit Committee did not
identify any information that warranted any modification or change to the
Company&#146;s financial statements. Such litigation could result in substantial
costs and have a material impact on the financial condition, results of
operation and cash flow of the Company. The Company could be required to pay
substantial damages, if the Company were to lose any of these lawsuits.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>The Company&#146;s operations are focused on a limited geographic area.</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Substantially all of the Company&#146;s revenue is generated by serving customers in
the Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio areas. An economic downturn or natural
disaster occurring in this limited operating territory could have a
disproportionate effect on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flow compared to similar companies of a national scope
and similar companies operating in different geographic areas. Refer to Note 23
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item&nbsp;8 on this Form

some investment in furniture and office equipment, computer equipment and
associated operating system software, application system software, leasehold
improvements and other assets. Facilities equipment and access circuits leased
as part of an operating lease arrangement are expensed as equipment or services

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Dividends</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company discontinued dividend payments on its common shares effective after
the second quarter 1999 dividend payment in August&nbsp;1999. The Company does not
intend to pay dividends on its common shares in the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, the Company&#146;s future ability to pay dividends is restricted by
certain covenants and agreements pertaining to outstanding indebtedness. The
Company pays dividends on its 6&#190;% preferred shares in accordance with its
Amended Articles of Incorporation.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company converted to a cash pay option on its BRCOM 12&#189;% preferred
shares on November&nbsp;16, 1999, and subsequently made its first cash payment on
February&nbsp;15, 2000. Dividends on the 12&#189;% preferred shares are accounted
for in the caption &#147;Minority interest expense (income)&#148; in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). In 2002 and 2003,
BRCOM&#146;s board of directors voted to defer the cash payments of the quarterly
dividend on the 12&#189;% preferred shares, in accordance with the terms of the
security. The Company continued to accrue the dividend in accordance with the
terms of the security. In March&nbsp;2003, the Company reached an agreement with
holders of more than two-thirds of BRCOM&#146;s 12&#189;% Junior Exchangeable
Preferred Stock to exchange this preferred stock for common stock of the
Company. On September&nbsp;8, 2003 the Company completed the exchange and issued
approximately 14.1&nbsp;million shares of Cincinnati Bell Inc. common stock for all
the 12&#189;% Junior Exchangeable Preferred Stock. Concurrently with the
preferred stock exchange offer, the Company solicited consents from holders of
BRCOM preferred stock to amend the certificate of the designation under which
the shares were issued to eliminate all voting rights and restrictive
covenants. Under the terms of the exchange offer, holders of the 12&#189;%
preferred shares were not paid any accumulated or unpaid dividends.

Operations&#148; which follows should be read in conjunction with the &#147;Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement&#148;,
&#147;Risk Factors,&#148; and Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Cincinnati Bell Inc. (&#147;the Company&#148;), f/k/a Broadwing Inc., provides
diversified telecommunications services through businesses in four segments:
Local, Wireless, Other and Broadband. A further discussion of these segments
and their operating results is discussed in Item&nbsp;1, &#147;Business&#148;, and in the
individual segment discussions which begin on page 35 of this Report on Form
10-K.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Introductory Note</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As previously disclosed, the Company has been investigating the allegations
contained in an amended class action securities lawsuit filed in December&nbsp;2003.
These allegations relate primarily to the manner in which the Company
recognized revenue, and wrote down assets, with respect to its former broadband
business. The Audit Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors has now
completed its investigation of those matters. In connection with that
investigation, adjustments have been identified related to the manner
in which the
Company recorded a particular broadband network construction agreement entered
into in 2000. These adjustments related to the timing of revenue recognition
resulting from the inappropriate inclusion of certain costs that had not been
fully incurred and use of estimates regarding the extent to which the
construction contract had been completed. The Company has restated its
financial statements to reflect the revised accounting for this contract. In
investigating plaintiffs&#146; other allegations, the Audit Committee did not
identify any information that warranted any modification or change to the
Company&#146;s financial statements.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the restatement relating to the construction contract, the
Company&#146;s revenue for the nine month period ended September&nbsp;30, 2003 was
unchanged compared to amounts previously reported, cost of services and
products for the nine month period decreased by $50.5&nbsp;million,
or 8.39%, and
net income for the nine month period increased by $50.5&nbsp;million,
or 11.52%; revenue and cost of services and products were unchanged in 2002 and the net
loss for 2002 increased by $18.0&nbsp;million, or 0.43%; revenue for 2001 decreased
by $30.6&nbsp;million, or 1.34%, cost of services and products for 2001 increased by
$15.1&nbsp;million, or 1.31%, and the net loss for 2001 increased by $29.4&nbsp;million,
or 10.27%; and revenue for 2000 decreased by $22.7&nbsp;million, or 1.14%, cost of
services and products for 2000 decreased by $17.9&nbsp;million, or 1.85%, and the
net loss for 2000 increased by $3.1&nbsp;million, or 0.82%. Thus, there was no
cumulative change to net income or shareowners&#146;
equity from 2000 through 2003 as a result of the restatement. A summary of the
effects of the restatement on the Company&#146;s financial statements follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s restatement includes the reversal of a related unbilled account
receivable of $50.5 million that was previously written off in the
second quarter of 2003, as the account receivable was eliminated as a result of
the adjustments to revenue in 2001 and 2000.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In November&nbsp;2001, the Company publicly announced its intention to exit the
broadband network construction business. Thereafter, the Company did not enter
into any new network construction agreements and no revenue was recognized in
either 2002 or 2003 on the broadband network construction contract referenced
above. As previously disclosed, the Company effectively completed the sale of
substantially all of the assets of its broadband business in June&nbsp;2003. See
&#147;Item&nbsp;7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations &#150; Broadband &#150; Costs and Expenses.&#148;



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As a result of the restatement of the Company&#146;s previously issued financial
statements, the Company was in default on its Credit Agreement and 16% Notes
Indenture, and as a result of cross-default provisions, the Cincinnati Bell
Telephone Notes. In March&nbsp;2004, the Company&#146;s Credit Agreement and 16% Notes
Indenture were amended to provide that the restatement does not constitute an
event of default, which eliminated the cross-default of the Cincinnati Bell
Telephone Notes.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company will file amended Form&nbsp;10-Qs to restate its financial statements
for the quarters ended March&nbsp;31, 2003, June&nbsp;30, 2003 and September&nbsp;30, 2003.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The restated consolidated financial statements for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2002 and 2001 and the restated selected financial data for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2000 contained in this Form&nbsp;10-K supercede the financial
statements and selected financial data for such periods in the Company&#146;s Form
10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 and for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2001.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For a further discussion of the restatement, see Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During the second and third quarter of 2003, the Company sold substantially all
of the assets of its broadband business, which is reported in the Broadband
segment. These assets were held by the Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary,
BRCOM (f/k/a Broadwing Communications Inc.). Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the sale.
During the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold
substantially all of the assets of Cincinnati Bell Directory (&#147;CBD&#148;), which was
previously reported in the Other segment. The disposition of CBD has been
accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with SFAS 144.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Executive Summary</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Cincinnati Bell Inc., is a full-service local provider of data and voice
communications services and equipment and a regional provider of wireless and long distance
communications services. The Company provides telecommunications service on
its owned local network with a well-regarded brand name and reputation for
service. The Company operates in four business segments: Local, Wireless, Other
and Broadband.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">For Cincinnati Bell, 2003 was a year of transition. The Company reached an
agreement to sell substantially all of its broadband business in February&nbsp;2003
and completed the sale in the second and third quarters of the year. In March
of 2003, the Company raised $350&nbsp;million in new capital and renegotiated its
credit facility in a challenging capital market for telecommunications
companies. In May of 2003 the Company changed its name to Cincinnati Bell in a
return to the roots of the Company&#146;s success over the past 130&nbsp;years. In August
of 2003, the Company exchanged the debt and preferred stock assumed in the
acquisition of the broadband business for common shares of Cincinnati Bell
Inc., reducing debt without sacrificing liquidity or utilizing cash. In July
and November of 2003, the Company again accessed the capital markets, this time
as the Company focused on generating cash flow and reducing debt, raising $500
million from the issuance of senior notes and $540&nbsp;million from the issuance of
senior subordinated notes. These transactions, combined with cash flow
generated from operations, allowed the Company to decrease its debt and
minority interest obligations by $675&nbsp;million during 2003, to
$2,328&nbsp;million,
and enter 2004 focused on generating cash flow to reduce debt and defend its
market position.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company expects 2004 to be challenging as it continues to reduce debt and
defend its core businesses from new and current competitors. In October&nbsp;2003,
the Company launched a GSM/GPRS wireless network in order to improve its cost
structure and to offer enhanced wireless data services. In December&nbsp;2003, the
Company announced management reporting changes intended to focus resources on
its key products &#151; local access, wireless, high-speed internet access and long
distance and to reduce its expense structure to generate more cash and pay down
debt. In March&nbsp;2004, the Company upgraded its DSL
network to provide even higher speed internet access &#151; up to four times faster
than the existing DSL network. In February&nbsp;2004, the Company also launched an
aggressive marketing campaign titled &#147;You Add, We Subtract.&#148; The marketing
campaign is designed to introduce a bundled suite of communications services
offering unlimited local, unlimited long distance, unlimited wireless and
high-speed internet service on a single bill for a reduced flat monthly fee.
This marketing campaign expands on the Company&#146;s bundling strategy which has
been successful in increasing monthly consumer revenue per household to $74.80 in 2003
from $72.84 and $71.59 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, which represents year
over year increases of 3% and 2%, respectively.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Excluding the Broadband segment, the Company expects revenue to decline in the
low single-digits compared to 2003, and operating income to be in the range of $295
million to $310&nbsp;million as a result of higher sales and marketing expense
related to incremental wireless and DSL customer acquisitions particularly into
service bundles that include an access line.
The Company believes its strategy to defend its local market and make targeted entry into
adjacent operating territories while, at the same time, reducing debt is the best approach
to maintain and enhance shareholder value. The Company also intends to maintain its
reputation for quality service established over the course of its 130-year history in the
Greater Cincinnati area.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Company to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses. The Company continually evaluates its
estimates, including but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition,
bad debts, income taxes, fixed assets, depreciation, access line costs,
restructuring, pensions, other postretirement benefits and contingencies. The
Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company believes the following critical accounting policies impact the more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated
financial statements. Additionally, the Company&#146;s senior management has
discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit and
Finance Committee. For a more detailed discussion of the application of these
and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue Recognition &#150; </B>The Company recognizes revenue as services are provided.
Local access fees are billed monthly, in
advance, while revenue is recognized as the services are provided. Postpaid
wireless, switched voice and data and Internet product services are billed monthly in arrears, while the revenue is recognized as the services are
provided. Equipment revenue is generally recognized upon performance
of contractual obligations, such as shipment, delivery, installation or
customer acceptance.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Prior to the sale of the broadband assets in the second and third quarter of
2003 (refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements),
broadband transport services were billed monthly, in advance, while revenue was
recognized as the services were provided. In addition, the Company had entered
into indefeasible right-of-use (&#147;IRU&#148;) agreements, which represent the lease of
network capacity or dark fiber, recording unearned revenue at the
earlier of the acceptance of the applicable portion of the network by the
customer or the receipt of cash. The buyer of IRU services typically paid cash
or other consideration upon execution of the contract, and the associated IRU
revenue was recognized over the life of the agreement as services were
provided, beginning on the date of customer acceptance. In the event the buyer
of an IRU terminated a contract prior to the contract expiration and released
the Company from the obligation to provide future services, the remaining
unamortized unearned revenue was recognized in the period in which the contract
was terminated. Concurrent with the broadband asset sale, substantially all of
the remaining IRU obligations were assumed by the buyer.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Cost of Providing Service &#150; </B>Prior to the sale of the broadband assets (refer to
Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company
maintained an accrued liability related to the broadband business for the cost
of circuits leased from other carriers and access minutes of use not yet
invoiced in order to appropriately record such costs in the period incurred.
The Company determined the estimate of the accrued cost of service liability
based on a variety of factors including circuits added or disconnected during
the period, expected recovery of disputed amounts and the mix of domestic and
international access minutes of use. If the actual amounts recovered from
disputes were less than expected or other charges were greater than expected,
an additional accrual and related expense was recorded. Concurrent with the
broadband asset sale, the accrued liability for cost of providing service was
assumed by the buyer.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Income Taxes </B>- The income tax provision consists of an amount for taxes
currently payable and an expense (or benefit) for tax consequences deferred to
future periods. The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets
depends upon the Company&#146;s ability to generate future taxable income during the
periods in which basis

its net operating loss carryforwards.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reversed $823.0&nbsp;million of deferred
tax asset valuation allowance previously established primarily due to the
uncertainties surrounding BRCOM&#146;s liquidity that were substantially mitigated.
In 2004 the Company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 50%.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $739.3
million, which included a valuation allowance of $262.0&nbsp;million related to
certain state and local net operating loss carryforwards. The Company
concluded, due to the sale of the broadband business and the historical and
future projected earnings of the remaining businesses, that the Company will
utilize future deductions and available net operating loss carryforwards prior
to their expiration. The Company also concluded that it was more likely than
not that certain state tax net operating loss carryforwards would not be
realized based upon the analysis described above and therefore provided a
valuation allowance.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Allowances for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable &#150;  </B>The Company establishes the
allowances for uncollectible accounts using both percentages of aged accounts
receivable balances to reflect the historical average of credit losses and
specific provisions for certain large, potentially uncollectible balances. The
Company believes its allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate based on
the methods previously described. However, if one or more of the Company&#146;s
larger customers were to default on its accounts receivable obligations, or
general economic conditions in the Company&#146;s operating area deteriorated, the
Company could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the
provisions established.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment  &#151; </B>The Company&#146;s provision for
depreciation of telephone plant is determined on a straight-line basis using
the whole life and remaining life methods. Provision for depreciation of other
property is based on the straight-line method over the estimated economic
useful life. Repairs and maintenance expense items are charged to expense as
incurred. Beginning in 2003, in connection with the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;143, &#147;Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations&#148; (&#147;SFAS 143&#148;), the cost of removal for telephone plant was included
in costs of products and services as incurred. In connection with this
accounting change, on January&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company recorded a benefit of $85.9
million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of
taxes, related to the adoption of SFAS 143. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company revised the estimated economic
useful life of its wireless TDMA network due to the implementation of and
expected migration to its GSM/GPRS network. The Company shortened its estimate
of the economic useful life of its TDMA network to December&nbsp;31, 2006. The
Wireless segment recorded additional depreciation expense of $5.2&nbsp;million to
reflect the acceleration of depreciation for the TDMA network. If the
migration to GSM/GPRS technology occurs more rapidly than the Company&#146;s current
estimates, the Company may be required to revise its estimate further or record
an impairment charge related to its TDMA network. In 2003, the change in
estimate reduced operating income and net income by $5.2
million and $3.4&nbsp;million, respectively. In 2003, basic and diluted earnings
per share were decreased by $0.02 and $0.01, respectively, as a result of this
change in estimate.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets &#151; </B>Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price consideration over the fair value of assets
acquired recorded in connection with purchase business combinations.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of Federal Communications
Commission (&#147;FCC&#148;) licenses for spectrum of the Wireless segment. The Company
determined that its wireless licenses met the definition of indefinite-lived
intangible assets under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;142,
&#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148; (&#147;SFAS 142&#148;) as the Company believes the
need for wireless spectrum will continue independently of technology and the
Company may renew the wireless licenses in a routine manner every ten

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">years for a nominal fee, provided the Company continues to meet the service and
geographic coverage provisions required by the FCC. Upon the adoption of SFAS
142 on January&nbsp;1, 2002, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of
$2,008.7&nbsp;million, net of tax, as a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle, related to the Broadband segment and ceased amortization of
remaining goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as discussed in Note
5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Pursuant to SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets not subject to
amortization are tested for impairment annually, or when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. For goodwill, a
two-step impairment test is performed. The first step compares the fair value
of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the
carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of
the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The
second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with
the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value is determined by
allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and
liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a
business combination. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over
the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of
goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is in excess
of the implied fair value of that goodwill, then an impairment loss is
recognized equal to that excess. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the
impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible
asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived
intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an
amount equal to that excess.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Other than Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived
Intangibles - </B>The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets,
other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets discussed above,
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an
asset (or group of assets) and its eventual disposition are less than its
carrying amount. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the
asset&#146;s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company performed an impairment
assessment of its Broadband segment long-lived assets as a result of the
restructuring plan implemented during the quarter and the strategic
alternatives being explored, including the potential sale of the Broadband
business. This assessment considered all of the contemplated strategic
alternatives for the Broadband segment, including a potential sale of assets,
using a probability-weighted approach. Based on this assessment, the Company
determined that the long-lived assets of Broadband segment were impaired and
recorded a $2,200.0&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying
value of these assets. Of the total charge, $1,901.7&nbsp;million related to
tangible fixed assets and $298.3&nbsp;million related to finite-lived intangible
assets.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company recorded a $3.4&nbsp;million asset impairment in the fourth quarter of
2003 to write-down the value of its public payphone assets to fair value. The
Company calculated the fair value of the assets utilizing a discounted cash
flow analysis based on the best estimate of projected cash flows from the
underlying assets.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The most significant of these numerous assumptions, which are reviewed
annually, include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets and health care cost trend rates. The discount rate is selected based
on current market interest rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at
December&nbsp;31 of each year. The health care cost trend rate is based on actual
claims experience and future projections of medical cost trends. The actuarial
assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing
market and economic conditions and other changes. Revisions to and variations
from these estimates would impact assets, liabilities, costs of services and products and
selling, general and administrative expenses.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, developed using the
building block approach, is based on the following: the participant&#146;s benefit
horizons; the mix of investments held directly by the plans, which is generally
60% equities and 40% bonds; and, the current view of expected future returns,
which is influenced by historical averages. The required use of an expected
versus actual long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized
pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of
those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected
long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns. To
the extent the Company changed its estimate of the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets, there would be an impact on pension expense or
income and the associated net liability or asset.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In its pension calculations, the Company utilizes the market-related value of
plan assets, which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset
fair values in a systematic and rational manner. Differences between actual
and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets
over five years.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can
impact the Company&#146;s operating results, financial position and cash flows.
Actual asset return experience results in an increase or decrease in the asset
base and this effect, in conjunction with a decrease in the pension discount
rate, may result in a plan&#146;s assets being less than a plan&#146;s accumulated
benefit obligation (&#147;ABO&#148;). The ABO is the present value of benefits earned to
date and is based on past compensation levels. The Company is required to show
in its consolidated balance sheet a net liability that is at least equal to the
ABO less the market value of plan assets. This liability is referred to as an
additional minimum pension liability (&#147;AML&#148;). An AML, which is recorded and
updated on December&nbsp;31 each year, is reflected as a long-term pension liability
with the offset recorded as an intangible asset, to the extent the Company has
unrecognized prior service costs, with the remainder recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss)&nbsp;in the equity section of the consolidated
balance sheet, net of tax.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The actuarial expense calculation for the postretirement health plan is based
on numerous assumptions, estimates and judgments including health care cost
trend rates and cap-related cost sharing. Certain of the Company&#146;s
non-management labor contracts contain an annual dollar value cap for the
purpose of determining postretirement health care contributions required from
retirees. The Company has waived cost sharing in excess of the cap during the
current contract period, but will begin collecting certain cost sharing
payments from certain non-management employees beginning in 2004. The caps for
certain contracts are set during each bargaining cycle in connection with the
negotiation of the overall contract. In accordance with the provisions of

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SFAS 106, the Company accounts for non-management retiree health benefits in
accordance with the terms of each individual contract.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company made the one-time election under FASB Staff Position (&#147;FSP&#148;) No.
106-1, &#147;Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003&#148; (&#147;FSP 106-1&#148;) to
defer accounting for any effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The Company has elected to defer
the accounting effects of the Act until the FASB issues guidance on how to
account for the federal subsidy. The Company expects the Act to reduce its
annual non-cash postretirement health expense by approximately $1&nbsp;million and
reduce its postretirement health liability by up to $12&nbsp;million,
assuming no plan design changes are implemented.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Due to the sale of the broadband assets and termination of approximately 1,052
BRCOM employees in the second quarter of 2003, the Company was required to
remeasure its pension liability as of June&nbsp;30, 2003 and record a curtailment loss. The net impact to the financial statements was a
decrease in the gain on sale of the broadband assets of $2.4&nbsp;million and a
corresponding increase in the pension liability.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Consolidated revenue totaled $1,557.8&nbsp;million in 2003, which was $620.8
million, or 28%, less than 2002. The primary reason for the revenue decline
was the sale of substantially all the broadband assets on June&nbsp;13, 2003 (refer
to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result of
the sale, the Broadband segment will no longer generate revenue for broadband
transport and switched voice services and will experience significant
reductions in data and Internet revenue. The Company expects a reduction in
consolidated revenue going forward of approximately 19% of 2003 revenues due to
the sale of the broadband assets. Excluding the Broadband segment, the Company
expects 2004 revenue to decline in the low single-digits compared to 2003, as
the Company defends its market position from advancing competition.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Cost of services and products totaled $681.5&nbsp;million in 2003 compared to
$1,035.6&nbsp;million in 2002, a decrease of $354.1&nbsp;million or 34%. The
majority of the decrease, or $316.8&nbsp;million, was the result of the sale of
substantially all of the broadband assets. The 2002 costs included $13.3
million of construction contract termination costs not repeated in 2003. The
remaining decline of $37.3&nbsp;million was primarily the result of lower CBTS costs
related to decreased equipment sales.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Selling, general and administrative (&#147;SG&#038;A&#148;) expenses of $353.1&nbsp;million in 2003
decreased $149.1&nbsp;million, or 30%, compared to 2002. The decrease was primarily
due to the sale of
substantially all the broadband assets in the second quarter of 2003, lower
payroll costs as a result of the October&nbsp;2002 restructuring further discussed
in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and cost reductions
of $4.7&nbsp;million as the Wireless segment assumed responsibility for network
management services previously outsourced to AWE. The SG&#038;A decrease associated
with the broadband assets sold was $159.3&nbsp;million. The decrease was offset by
an increase in SG&#038;A expense of $11.2&nbsp;million which was primarily the result of
success-based contractual incentives and termination benefits
for certain senior executives pursuant to the sale of the broadband assets
(Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The
termination benefits included $0.8&nbsp;million of non-cash charges related to the
accelerated vesting of stock options. Going forward, the Company expects a
significant decrease in SG&#038;A due to the disposition of broadband assets,
partially offset by increasing sales and marketing expenses related to
defending its markets from increased competition.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Depreciation expense decreased by 64%, or $301.9&nbsp;million, to $169.1&nbsp;million in
2003 compared to $471.0&nbsp;million in 2002. The decrease was primarily driven by
the Broadband segment as the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of
$1,901.7&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to the Broadband
segment&#146;s tangible assets (refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements). Additionally, due to the definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of its Broadband
segment, the broadband assets were classified as &#147;held for sale&#148; and the
Company ceased depreciation, in accordance with SFAS 144 on March&nbsp;1, 2003
(refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The
adoption of SFAS 143 on January&nbsp;1, 2003 (refer to Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements) also contributed to the reduction in
depreciation expense as removal costs previously recorded as depreciation
expense in the Local segment ceased, accounting for $6.4&nbsp;million of the
decrease.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Amortization expense of $0.6&nbsp;million in 2003 relates to roaming and trade name
agreements acquired by the Wireless segment. Amortization expense in 2003
decreased by $24.7&nbsp;million compared to 2002. The decrease was due to the
write-down of approximately $298.3&nbsp;million of intangible assets in 2002 in
association with the $2,200.0&nbsp;million non-cash asset impairment charge recorded
at the Broadband segment as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. As such, the Company expects annual amortization expense
going forward to be less than a million dollars.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Restructuring charges (credits)&nbsp;during 2003 of ($2.6) million were $39.7
million lower than 2002. Results in 2003 include $7.2&nbsp;million in reversals of
previously established reserves due to the settlement of terminated
contract obligations and a change in the estimate of the termination costs of
remaining contractual obligations. In December&nbsp;2003, the Company initiated a
restructuring in order to reduce future cash operating costs by approximately
$9.1&nbsp;million. This restructuring resulted in a charge of $4.6&nbsp;million related
to employee separation benefits for 106 employees. The $37.1&nbsp;million of
restructuring charges in 2002 were comprised of $16.5&nbsp;million recorded in the
first quarter of 2002 for employee termination benefits, the termination of a
contractual commitment with a vendor related to the November&nbsp;2001
restructuring, $9.6&nbsp;million recorded in the third quarter of 2002 primarily for
employee termination benefits related to the September&nbsp;2002 restructuring, and
$14.7&nbsp;million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to the October
2002 restructuring. A detailed discussion of each restructuring charge is
provided in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In 2003, the Company recorded $8.8&nbsp;million of asset impairments and other
charges, which consisted of $3.6&nbsp;million in asset impairments related to a
write-down of the value of its public payphone assets to fair value and a $5.2
million charge in 2003 as a result of a settlement reached with a customer
related to a contract dispute. Based on certain indicators, including a
potential asset sale, the Company performed an impairment analysis of the
assets of its Broadband segment in the fourth quarter of 2002. The Company&#146;s
impairment analysis indicated the carrying value of the assets was not
recoverable. Accordingly, the Company wrote down the

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Also included in the Company&#146;s operating income in 2003 was a $336.7&nbsp;million
gain related to the sale of broadband assets. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Operating income increased by $2,777.5&nbsp;million to $684.0&nbsp;million in 2003
compared to an operating loss of $2,093.5&nbsp;million in 2002. The increase was
principally due to reduced expenses as a result of the sale of the broadband
assets and the related gain, in addition to the asset impairment charge in 2002
of $2,200.0&nbsp;million related to the Broadband segment. Excluding the Broadband
segment, an increase in operating expenses is expected to decrease operating
income in 2004 to the range of $295 million to $310 million, as the Company defends its market
position.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Minority interest expense of $42.2&nbsp;million and $57.6&nbsp;million in 2003 and 2002,
respectively, includes the accrual of dividends and accretion on the 12&#189;%
Junior Exchangeable Preferred Stock of BRCOM (the &#147;12&#189;% Preferreds&#148;) and the
19.9% minority interest of AT&#038;T Wireless Services Inc. (&#147;AWE&#148;) in the net
income of CBW. Although the Company announced the deferral of the August&nbsp;15,
2002, November&nbsp;15, 2002, February&nbsp;15, 2003, May&nbsp;15, 2003, and August&nbsp;15, 2003
cash dividend payment on the 12&#189;% Preferreds, the Company continued to
accrue the dividends in accordance with the terms of the security. On
September&nbsp;8, 2003 the Company completed the exchange of all of the 12&#189;%
Preferreds for approximately 14.1&nbsp;million shares of Cincinnati Bell Inc. common
stock.
As a result of this exchange, minority interest expense in 2003 decreased $13.8 million compared to 2002, to $32.0 million.
Under the terms of the exchange, holders of the 12&#189;%
Preferreds were not paid any accumulated or unpaid dividends. A detailed
discussion of minority interest is provided in Note 10 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Interest expense and other financing costs of $234.2&nbsp;million in 2003 increased
$70.0&nbsp;million, or 43%, compared to $164.2&nbsp;million in 2002. The increase is the
result of the issuance of the 16% Senior Subordinated Discount Due 2009 (the
&#147;16% notes&#148;), the increase in the interest rate on the convertible
subordinated notes in March&nbsp;2003, the issuance of the 7&#188;% Senior notes due
2013 in July&nbsp;2003, the $16.4&nbsp;million write-off of deferred financing costs
related to the prepayment and amendments of the Company&#146;s credit facilities,
and an increase in the interest rate on the Company&#146;s credit
facilities. These increases were
partially offset by a decline in interest expense on the Company&#146;s credit
facilities resulting from the significant reduction in outstanding borrowings
under these facilities. As a result of the above and the issuance of the 8 3/8% Senior subordinated notes due 2014 and the
extinguishment of the convertible subordinated notes, the Company expects a
decrease in interest expense of approximately $25.0&nbsp;million in 2004 compared to
2003. A detailed discussion of indebtedness is presented in Note 8 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The following table summarizes the components of the expected decrease in
interest expense in 2004 compared to 2003:

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On September&nbsp;8, 2003, the Company retired the remaining $46.0&nbsp;million of BRCOM
9% notes (&#147;9% notes&#148;) and satisfied $1.6&nbsp;million in accrued interest in
exchange for approximately 11.1&nbsp;million shares of common stock of the Company,
which had a fair value of $65.0&nbsp;million at the exchange date. As a result, the
Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt, in other non-operating
expense, of $17.4&nbsp;million during the third quarter of 2003.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On November&nbsp;19, 2003, the Company purchased all of the outstanding Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2009, which bore interest at a rate of 9%, at a
discounted price equal to 97% of their accreted value. As a result, the
Company recorded other non-operating income of $16.2&nbsp;million from the
extinguishment of debt.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a gain of $10.0&nbsp;million
from the modification of a capital lease at the Company&#146;s headquarters in other
non-operating income. This modification required the lease to be reclassified
from a capital lease to an operating lease. The gain primarily represents the difference
between the carrying value of the capital lease assets and the related lease
obligation at the date of modification.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company recorded a $10.7&nbsp;million non-cash loss on investments in 2002
due to an other than temporary decline
in value of one of the Company&#146;s cost-based investments.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company reported an income tax benefit of $828.8&nbsp;million in 2003. This
compares to an expense of $123.7&nbsp;million reported in 2002. The income tax
benefit recorded in 2003 relates substantially to the reversal of a previously
recorded deferred tax valuation allowance due to the uncertainties surrounding
the liquidity of the Company&#146;s subsidiary, BRCOM Inc. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company
reversed $823.0&nbsp;million of the valuation allowance as the uncertainties
surrounding BRCOM&#146;s liquidity were substantially mitigated. In 2002, the
Company had income tax expense of $123.7&nbsp;million, due substantially to the
establishment of a valuation allowance of $1,110.7&nbsp;million against certain
federal and state deferred tax assets (including net operating loss
carryforwards), offset substantially by the tax effect of the $2.2&nbsp;billion
asset impairment. The effective rate of negative (198.7%) in 2003 was 193.4
points lower than the effective rate of negative (5.3%) in the same period of
2002. The decrease in the rate was due to reversal of a previously recorded
deferred tax valuation allowance. In 2004 the
Company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 50%. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As a result of the items previously discussed, income from continuing
operations before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle increased $3,695.2&nbsp;million in 2003 to $1,246.0&nbsp;million
compared to a loss of $2,449.2&nbsp;million in 2002. In addition, the corresponding
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled $5.02 in 2003
compared to the diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $11.27 in
2002.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Substantially all of the assets of CBD were sold on March&nbsp;8, 2002 for $345.0
million cash and a 2.5% equity interest in the newly formed company. Income
from discontinued operations totaled zero in 2003 compared to $217.6&nbsp;million in
2002. The net gain from the sale of substantially all of the assets of CBD of
$211.8&nbsp;million was recorded in 2002 and the remaining income was related to the
operations of CBD from January 1 through March&nbsp;8, 2002. A detailed discussion
of discontinued operations is provided in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company recorded a benefit of $85.9&nbsp;million as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of taxes, related to
the adoption of SFAS 143. The benefit principally related to the estimated
telephone plant removal costs previously included in accumulated depreciation,
which were reversed. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a detailed discussion of the adoption of SFAS 143.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, the Company recorded a $2,008.7&nbsp;million charge as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of taxes, related to
the adoption of SFAS 142. The write-down of goodwill, finalized in the second
quarter of 2002, was related to the fair value of goodwill associated with the
broadband business acquired in 1999. See Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the adoption of
SFAS 142.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Consolidated revenue totaled $2,178.6&nbsp;million in 2002, which was $73.7&nbsp;million,
or 3%, less than 2001. Approximately $56.8&nbsp;million of the decrease was attributable to network
construction, as the Company decided to exit that business as part of the
November&nbsp;2001 restructuring plan discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. The decline of switched voice services of
$51.9&nbsp;million contributed much of the remaining decrease, as rates and volume
fell due to intense competition. The decreases were partially offset by
non-cash revenue of $58.7&nbsp;million resulting from the termination
of two IRU contracts in conjunction with two customers&#146; bankruptcies and a
reduction in uncollectible revenue due to tighter credit and collection
policies.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Refer to Discussion of Operating Segment Results on page <I>62 </I>of this Report on
Form 10-K for detailed discussion of revenue by segment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Costs and Expenses</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Cost of services and products totaled $1,035.6&nbsp;million in 2002 compared to
$1,169.3&nbsp;million in 2001, a decrease of $133.7&nbsp;million, or 11%. Costs of
services and products of the Broadband segment decreased nearly $119.7&nbsp;million
due the exit of network construction and a decrease in switched voice services
usage consistent with the decline in revenue. The decreases were offset
partially by a charge of $13.3&nbsp;million for costs associated with
the termination of an uncompleted network construction contract. The
termination of the uncompleted network construction project is discussed in
further detail in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Local segment costs decreased $9.3&nbsp;million in 2002 compared to 2001, due to
efficiencies gained through the merger of the DSL and dial-up Internet
operations of ZoomTown with CBT. The remainder of the increase in cost of
services and products over 2001 was incurred by the Other segment, which
experienced higher costs associated with increased minutes of use from the
Company&#146;s long distance business.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SG&#038;A expenses of $502.2&nbsp;million in 2002 decreased $47.4&nbsp;million, or 9%,
compared to 2001. The Broadband segment&#146;s SG&#038;A decreased nearly $23.9&nbsp;million,
primarily due to lower employee headcount resulting from the November&nbsp;2001
restructuring (discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements) and a decrease in marketing expenses, partially offset by an
increase in bad debt expense of $9.0&nbsp;million due to continued industry
deterioration. SG&#038;A in the Wireless segment decreased $9.6&nbsp;million in 2002
compared to 2001, primarily due to a reduction in advertising and promotional
spending of $7.0&nbsp;million as postpaid gross subscriber additions were 37% below
2001. The remaining decrease was the result of cost reductions from the
November&nbsp;2001 restructuring and a decrease in customer acquisition costs in the
Other segment.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Depreciation expense increased by 7%, or $29.8&nbsp;million, to $471.0&nbsp;million in
2002 compared to $441.2&nbsp;million in 2001. The increase was primarily driven by
the Broadband segment and reflects the completion of the build out of its
national optical network and placement of those assets into service. The Local
and Wireless segments generated the remainder of the increase as they continued
to maintain and enhance their networks. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the
Company recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of $2,200.0&nbsp;million related to

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Amortization expense of $25.3&nbsp;million in 2002 related to intangible assets
acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization expense in 2002
decreased by $88.3&nbsp;million compared to 2001 due to the Company ceasing
amortization of goodwill upon the adoption of SFAS 142 on January&nbsp;1, 2002. An
adjusted presentation of amortization expense and the impact on net income is
provided in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additionally, the Company wrote-down approximately $298&nbsp;million of intangible
assets in 2002 in association with the $2.2&nbsp;billion non-cash asset impairment
charge recorded at the Broadband segment discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In October&nbsp;2002, the Company initiated a restructuring of the Broadband segment
that was intended to reduce annual expenses in 2003 by approximately $200
million compared to 2002 and enable the Broadband segment to become cash flow
positive. The plan included initiatives to reduce the workforce by
approximately 500 positions; reduce line costs through network grooming,
optimization, and rate negotiations; and exit the wholesale international voice
business. In addition, the Local segment initiated a restructuring to realign
sales and marketing to better focus on enterprise customers. The plan included
initiatives to reduce the workforce by 38 positions. The Company recorded a
cash restructuring charge of $14.7&nbsp;million during the fourth quarter of 2002
related to these initiatives.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2002, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $9.6&nbsp;million.
The restructuring charges consisted of $4.6&nbsp;million related to employee
separation benefits and $5.0&nbsp;million related to contractual terminations
associated with the Company&#146;s exit of a product line. The restructuring costs
included the cost of employee separation benefits, including severance, medical
and other benefits, related to three employees, including the former CEO, of
the Company. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002, the restructuring had been completed. Total cash expenditures in connection with the restructuring during
2002 amounted to $9.1&nbsp;million.
<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">
In 2002, the restructuring activities for the November&nbsp;2001 Restructuring Plan
were completed, except for certain lease obligations, which are expected to
continue through December&nbsp;31, 2015. An additional $16.5&nbsp;million in
restructuring costs were incurred in the first quarter of 2002 relating to
costs for employee termination benefits and termination of a contractual
commitment with a vendor, which were actions contemplated in the original plan
for which an amount could not be reasonably estimated in 2001. Additionally,
during the fourth quarter of 2002, $1&nbsp;million of previously recorded
restructuring charges were reversed due to a change in estimate related to the
termination of contractual obligations. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the November
2001 Restructuring Plan.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In February&nbsp;2001, the Company initiated a reorganization of the activities of
several of its Cincinnati-based subsidiaries, including CBT, CBAD, CBW and
Public in order to create one centralized &#147;Cincinnati Bell&#148; presence for its
customers. Total restructuring costs of $9.4&nbsp;million were recorded in the
first quarter of 2001. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company reversed
$2.1&nbsp;million of restructuring expense previously recorded due to an expected
lease termination that did not occur. This restructuring plan resulted in cash
outlays of $6.4&nbsp;million and non-cash items of $0.9&nbsp;million. As of December&nbsp;31,
2002, the restructuring was completed.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the third quarter of 2002, the restructuring activities for the 1999
Restructuring Plan were completed. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion on the 1999
Restructuring Plan. The remaining reserve balance of $0.5&nbsp;million related to
facility closure costs was reversed in the third quarter of 2002, as it was not
required.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Based on certain indicators, including a potential asset sale, the Company
performed an impairment analysis of the assets of its Broadband segment in the
fourth quarter of 2002. The Company&#146;s impairment analysis indicated the
carrying value of the assets was not recoverable. Accordingly, the Company
wrote down the assets to estimated fair market value, resulting in a non-cash
impairment charge of $2,200.0&nbsp;million. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2001, the Company recorded non-cash
asset impairment charges of $152.0&nbsp;million, which primarily related to the
November&nbsp;2001 restructuring. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The operating loss increased by $1,826.7&nbsp;million to $2,093.5&nbsp;million in 2002
compared to $266.8&nbsp;million in 2001. The increase in the loss was due to the
asset impairment charge of $2,200.0&nbsp;million related to the Broadband segment.
Excluding the asset impairment charges of $2,200.0&nbsp;million in 2002 and $152.0
million in 2001, operating income increased to $107.4&nbsp;million from an operating
loss of $114.8&nbsp;million recorded in 2001. The increase was primarily due to a
reduction of $88.3&nbsp;million in amortization expense related to the adoption of
SFAS 142, a reduction of $56.3&nbsp;million in restructuring expenses, a reduction
of $33.5&nbsp;million in SG&#038;A expenses at the Broadband and Wireless segments and a
reduction in network construction revenue, partially offset by
an increase in depreciation expense of $29.8&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Minority interest expense includes the accrual of dividends and accretion on
the 12 &#189;% preferred stock of BRCOM and the 19.9% minority interest of AT&#038;T
Wireless Services Inc. (&#147;AWE&#148;) in the net income of the Company&#146;s CBW
subsidiary. Because AWE&#146;s minority interest in the net income of CBW is
recorded as an expense, the improved profitability of CBW increased minority
interest expense from $51.3&nbsp;million in 2001 to $57.6&nbsp;million in 2002. Although
the Company announced the deferral of the August&nbsp;15, 2002 and November&nbsp;15, 2002 cash
dividend payments on the 12 &#189;% preferred stock of BRCOM, the Company
continued to accrue the dividends in accordance with the terms of the security.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Interest expense and other financing costs of $164.2&nbsp;million in 2002 decreased
$3.9&nbsp;million, or 2%, compared to $168.1&nbsp;million recorded in 2001. The decrease
was the result of lower interest rates, as the London Interbank Offering Rate
(&#147;LIBOR&#148;) decrease more than offset increases due to credit downgrades. In
addition, lower outstanding debt, substantially as a result of a pay down from
the proceeds received from the sale of CBD, contributed to the decrease in
interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by a reduction of
$14.5&nbsp;million in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of the
optical network and an increase of $8.7&nbsp;million in other financing costs
related to several amendments to the credit facility consummated during 2002.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company recorded a $10.7&nbsp;million non-cash loss on investments in 2002,
reflecting a $22.5&nbsp;million decrease compared to an $11.8&nbsp;million net gain on
investments in 2001. The non-cash net loss recorded in 2002 was due to an
other than temporary decline in value of one of the Company&#146;s cost-based
investments. The net gain in 2001 was comprised of a $17.0&nbsp;million gain from
the sale of the Company&#146;s investment in PSINet, a $23.9&nbsp;million gain from the
Company&#146;s investment in Corvis, and a $3.0&nbsp;million mark-to-market adjustment of
Anthem Inc. shares. These gains were offset by $26.1&nbsp;million in impairment
write-downs of the Company&#146;s cost-based investments and $5.9&nbsp;million of
mark-to-market adjustments and losses on the sale of Applied Theory shares.
Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
detailed discussion of investments.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Other income of less than $1&nbsp;million in 2002 decreased $20.4&nbsp;million compared
to 2001. Other income in 2001 was primarily due to the receipt of $19.7
million of common shares of Anthem Inc. as the result of Anthem&#146;s
demutualization.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company had income tax expense of $123.7&nbsp;million in 2002 compared to a
$112.8&nbsp;million benefit recorded in 2001, due substantially to the establishment
of a valuation allowance of $1,110.7&nbsp;million against certain federal and state
deferred tax assets (including net operating loss carryforwards), offset
substantially by the tax

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">effect of the $2.2&nbsp;billion asset impairment. The effective rate of negative (5.3%) in 2002 was 29.9 points lower than the
effective rate of 24.6% in the same period of 2001. The decrease in the rate
was due to the net effect of the cessation of amortization of goodwill in 2002
and the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain federal and
state deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Income from discontinued operations reflects the net income of CBD in 2002 and
2001. Substantially all of the assets of this business were sold on March&nbsp;8,
2002 for $345.0&nbsp;million cash and a 2.5% equity interest in the newly formed
company. Income from discontinued operations totaled $217.6&nbsp;million in 2002
compared to $29.6&nbsp;million in 2001, as the net gain from the sale of
substantially all of the assets of CBD of $211.8&nbsp;million was recorded in 2002.
A detailed discussion of discontinued operations is provided in Note 17 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, the Company recorded a $2,008.7&nbsp;million expense as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of taxes, related to
the adoption of SFAS 142. The write-down of goodwill, finalized in the second
quarter of 2002, was related to the fair value of goodwill associated with the
Broadband business acquired in 1999. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the adoption of
SFAS 142.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company reported a net loss of $4,240.3&nbsp;million in 2002 compared to a net
loss of $315.6&nbsp;million in 2001. The diluted loss per share of $19.47 in 2002
was $17.97 larger than the loss per share of $1.50 in 2001. The 2002 period
included a loss per share of $9.20 related to the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle, net of taxes, for the adoption of SFAS 142. The 2002
and 2001 periods included income from discontinued operations per share of
$1.00 and $0.14, respectively. Excluding discontinued operations and the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, the Company reported a
loss per share from continuing operations of $11.27 in 2002 compared to a loss
per share from continuing operations of $1.64 for 2001.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The $9.63 increase in loss per share from continuing operations was due to the
increase in asset impairment charges, which contributed $6.10 per share, an
increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which contributed $4.84
per share and higher depreciation expense of $0.09 per share. These increases
in loss per share from continuing operations were partially offset by the
cessation of goodwill amortization resulting from the adoption of SFAS 142,
which contributed $0.40 per share; and the decrease in restructuring expenses,
which contributed $0.17 per share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Discussion of Operating Segment Results</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Prior to the sale of substantially all of the Company&#146;s broadband assets on
June&nbsp;13, 2003, CBT sold the broadband products and services of its BRCOM
subsidiary to customers in its operating territory. Historically, CBT
recognized the customer-invoiced amount on such sales as revenue and the
related intercompany cost of providing services as expense within its Local
segment operating results. Accordingly, the BRCOM subsidiary recognized
intercompany revenue equal to the costs of providing services recorded by the
Local segment and the costs to provide such services in the operating results
of the Broadband segment.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Pursuant to an agreement negotiated as part of the sale of broadband assets,
the Company has recast the historical operating results of the Local and
Broadband segments to reflect an agency agreement whereby CBT earns a sales
commission and the BRCOM subsidiary records the remaining revenue and
associated costs of providing services in its operating results. CBT will
continue to market these broadband products and services on behalf of the
buyers&#146; of the broadband assets and will purchase capacity on the buyers&#146;
national network in order to sell long distance services under the CBAD brand
to residential and business customers in the Greater Cincinnati area market.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2003 Compared to 2002</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Local segment revenue decreased $12.7&nbsp;million, or 2%, in 2003 compared to 2002.
Declines in access line and equipment revenue and related installation and
maintenance were greater than revenue growth from value-added services such as
custom calling features, DSL transport and internet service provider revenue.
<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">
Local service revenue of $466.4&nbsp;million during 2003 decreased less than 1%, or
$1.7&nbsp;million, in comparison to the prior year. Revenue decreased due to fewer
access lines, which were down 2.6% from 1,012,000 lines in service at December
31, 2002 to 986,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. The Company expects access lines
to continue to decrease in 2004 by approximately 2% to 4% compared to access lines in service at December 31, 2003. The Company has
been able to substantially offset the decrease in revenue from access line
losses by capturing a greater share of revenue per consumer household through
product bundling offers and increasing DSL penetration. Product
bundling and,
in particular, the bundling of DSL transport with internet access, was the key
driver behind the increase in revenue per household to $46.61 in 2003 compared
to $45.04 in 2002.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s Complete Connections&#174; bundled services offering added 23,600
subscribers during 2003, bringing total subscribership to 312,500 and
penetration of residential access lines to 44%. In the first quarter of 2003,
CBT also introduced Custom Connections<SUP>SM</SUP>, a bundled suite of services that
leverages the Company&#146;s local, long

Custom Connections<SUP>SM</SUP> added 54,700 subscribers in 2003. The favorable bundled
pricing associated with Custom Connections<SUP>SM</SUP> has driven increased demand for
the Company&#146;s ZoomTown DSL offering, which added 24,700 customers in 2003,
growth of 33% from December 31, 2002. As a result of this growth,
total lines to the consumer (defined as consumer access lines plus DSL
subscribers) increased slightly on a year-over-year basis. At of December&nbsp;31,
2003, 86% of CBT&#146;s access lines were loop-enabled for DSL
transport with a penetration of approximately 12.6% of these addressable network access lines, up
from 9.3% at December&nbsp;31, 2002.



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">
Network access revenue consists of special access, switched access and end user common
line ("EUCL") revenue, with 2003 revenue of $202.4 million representing a $1.7 million, or
1%, decline compared to 2002. Special access revenue of $95.5 million in 2003 represented
47% of the revenue in the network access category, while the $40.4 million in switched access
and $66.5 million in EUCL charges represented 20% and 33%, respectively, of the 2003
network access revenue total. Special access revenue of $95.5 million was $2.0 million, or 2%,
less than in 2002, while switched access revenue increased $1.4 million, or 4%, in comparison
to 2002. EUCL charges of $66.5 million declined slightly from the prior year, with
a $1.1 million, or 2%, decline representing the net effect of a small, midyear rate increase,
offset by decreased access lines on which to apply this charge.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Other services revenue of $151.6&nbsp;million during 2003 decreased $9.3&nbsp;million, or
6%, compared to 2002. Other services revenue declines were substantially due
to a combined decrease of $7.5&nbsp;million from the sale of equipment and
associated installation and maintenance. These declines were partially offset
by a $2.0&nbsp;million increase in commission revenue from the sale of broadband
products.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Costs and Expenses</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Cost of services and products decreased $1.8&nbsp;million, or 1%, to $260.0
million in 2003 compared to 2002. The decreases were primarily due to a
decrease in cost of products of $6.9&nbsp;million related to lower equipment
revenue, partially offset by an increase in employee expenses of $5.0
million. The increases in employee expenses was a net result of a 7% reduction in headcount offset by
normal wage increases and an increase in actuarially determined employee
benefit expenses.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SG&#038;A expenses decreased 4%, or $6.0&nbsp;million, compared to 2002,
as the Local segment experienced decreases in bad debt, advertising,
promotional and contract services expenses. These expense reductions were
partially offset by higher payroll and related expenses of $1.9&nbsp;million, which
was the net effect of a reduction in headcount, offset by normal wage increases and higher benefits expense.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Depreciation expense of $125.7&nbsp;million decreased $21.0&nbsp;million, or 14%, in 2003
compared to 2002. A decrease in depreciable assets, reduced capital spending,
regulatory depreciation rate decreases and the adoption of SFAS 143 on January
1, 2003 (refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)
contributed to the reduction in depreciation expense.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">
Restructuring charges of $4.5&nbsp;million during 2003 were $5.0&nbsp;million higher than
the $0.5&nbsp;million in restructuring credits in 2002. In December&nbsp;2003, the
Company initiated a restructuring intended to reduce future cash operating
costs by approximately $9.1&nbsp;million. The Local segment&#146;s charge was $4.5
million related to employee separation benefits associated with the elimination
of approximately 90 positions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Operating Income</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As a result of the above, operating income increased by $10.8&nbsp;million, or 4%,
to $296.1&nbsp;million in 2003 compared to $285.3&nbsp;million in 2002. Operating margin
showed similar improvements, increasing two points

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">from a margin of 34.2% in 2002 to a margin of 36.1% in 2003. As the Company expects to incur increased
sales and marketing expenses to defend its market position in 2004, it expects
the Local segment&#146;s operating income to decrease by 1% to 3% compared to 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2002 Compared to 2001</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Local revenue increased $8.4&nbsp;million, or 1%, compared to 2001, to $833.1&nbsp;million in 2002.
Revenue growth was attributable to high-speed data and Internet services such
as DSL and value-added services such as custom calling features, partially
offset by a decrease in residential and business revenue as access lines
decreased in 2002 compared to 2001.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Local service revenue increased $2.8&nbsp;million, or 1%, in 2002 compared to 2001.
In 2002, revenue growth from value-added services and DSL was offset by
declining business and residential access line revenue. Access lines decreased
to 1,012,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2002, a 1.9% decrease from the 1,032,000 lines
in service as of December&nbsp;31, 2001. The Company&#146;s Complete Connections&#174;
bundled service offering added 53,000 subscribers in 2002, bringing total
subscribership to 289,000 and penetration of residential access lines to 39%.
Of the 289,000 total Complete Connections&#174; subscribers, nearly 30,000 had
chosen CBT&#146;s all-inclusive product bundling offer, Complete Connections
Universal&#174;, which includes a combination of local services and custom calling
features, long distance, wireless, dial-up and high-speed Internet access, and
home security as chosen by the subscriber. CBT continued to expand the
Company&#146;s DSL high-speed data transport service with subscribership growing to
75,000, a 23% increase over 2001.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Network access revenue decreased by $1.2&nbsp;million, or 1%, to $204.1&nbsp;million in
2002 compared to 2001 as carrier customers continued to reduce their capacity
requirements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Other services revenue grew 4%, or $6.8&nbsp;million, to $160.9&nbsp;million in 2002
compared to 2001. The increase was due to commissions earned from the sale of broadband services and
equipment and related installation and maintenance revenue. Revenue
attributable to the sale of broadband services totaled $7.1&nbsp;million and $2.3
million in 2002 and 2001, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Costs and Expenses</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Cost of services and products of $261.8&nbsp;million in 2002 decreased $9.3
million, or 3%, compared to 2001. These decreases were primarily due to
efficiencies gained through the merger of the DSL and dial-up Internet
operations of ZoomTown with CBT.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SG&#038;A expenses increased 4%, or $4.8&nbsp;million, in 2002 compared to 2001,
primarily due to increases in bad debt expense and advertising of $12.6
million, which was offset by a 7% reduction in headcount and improved cost
management.
<BR><BR>
Depreciation expense of $146.7&nbsp;million increased $6.4&nbsp;million, or 5%, in 2002
compared to 2001 as a result of asset additions related to the continued
construction of the network infrastructure.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In October&nbsp;2002, CBT initiated a restructuring to realign sales and marketing
to better focus on enterprise customers. The plan included initiatives to
reduce the workforce by approximately 38 positions and resulted in
restructuring charges of $1&nbsp;million related to employee separation benefits.
In November&nbsp;2001, the Company&#146;s management approved a restructuring plan which
included initiatives to consolidate data centers, reduce the expense structure,
exit the network construction business, eliminate other nonstrategic operations
and merge

The Local segment recorded restructuring costs of $4&nbsp;million in 2001
related to these initiatives. In February&nbsp;2001, the Company initiated a
reorganization of the activities of several of its Cincinnati-based
subsidiaries, CBT, CBAD, CBW and Public in order to create one centralized
&#147;Cincinnati Bell&#148; presence for its customers. The Local segment recorded
restructuring costs of $8&nbsp;million pertaining to the February&nbsp;2001 restructuring
plan which consisted of $2&nbsp;million related to lease terminations and $6&nbsp;million
related to involuntary employee separation benefits (including severance,
medical insurance and other benefits) for 114 employees. In 2002, the
restructuring activities for the February&nbsp;2001 Restructuring Plan were
completed and the remaining reserve balance of $2&nbsp;million related to a lease
termination that did not occur was reversed. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2003 Compared to 2002</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">
Wireless segment revenue decreased $7.7 million, or 3%,
to $259.5 million during 2003 compared to 2002.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">
This revenue decline was primarily driven by postpaid services.
In 2003, revenue from postpaid customers decreased $10.0 million, or 5%, to $209.3 million.
Postpaid ARPU decreased from $58.75 in 2002 to $55.98 in 2003, or $2.77 per user, per month,
due to pricing pressure from increasing competition and a marketing strategy employed through
the first three quarters of 2003 to retain lower usage, higher margin customers.
Through September 30, 2003, postpaid subscribers had declined by 12,000 compared to the
December 31, 2002.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">
Beginning in September 2003, the Company introduced more competitive rate plans in order to
reduce churn and to build momentum in front of its GSM/GPRS network launch in October 2003.
The Company expects the new rate plans, in combination with its GSM/GPRS network to increase
postpaid subscribers, which will offset revenue from declining ARPU.
In the fourth quarter of 2003, net adds totaled 13,000, which reversed a declining subscriber
trend for the first three quarters of 2003 and allowed CBW to end the year with approximately
the same number of postpaid subscribers as at the end of 2002, or nearly 312,000.
This subscribership represents an estimated 9% penetration of the population within the
Company&#146;s licensed service area in the Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio metropolitan
markets.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">
In the first three quarters of 2003, the Company also focused its marketing efforts on prepaid
subscribers. These subscribers require less growth capital on the
Company&#146;s TDMA network, which the Company attempted to minimize because
it curtailed TDMA capital expenditures, while it completed construction of its GSM/GPRS network.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As mandated by the FCC, wireless local number portability (&#147;WLNP&#148;) was
effective November&nbsp;24, 2003 and allows customers the ability to change service
providers within the same local area and retain the same phone number.
However, average monthly customer churn remained low in the face of aggressive
competition and WLNP at 1.81% for postpaid subscribers in 2003 compared to
1.73% in 2002.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The postpaid revenue decline is being partially offset by the prepaid product,
which experienced subscriber growth in 2003 of 2% compared to
subscribers as of December 31, 2002. The
Company had approximately 162,000 prepaid subscribers at December&nbsp;31, 2003, or
nearly 3,300 more than at December&nbsp;31, 2002, which represents an estimated
penetration of approximately 5% of the population in the Company&#146;s licensed
service area. Prepaid revenue of $37.1&nbsp;million represented growth of
$3.0&nbsp;million, or 9%, compared to 2002 due to increased revenue from text
messaging services, which increased ARPU. ARPU for prepaid subscribers increased from $18.32 in 2002
to $19.24 in 2003, or $0.92 per user. The Company&#146;s text messaging services,
comprising a growing proportion of total prepaid revenue, increased by $2.2
million versus 2002 to $6.0&nbsp;million, which represents 16% of total prepaid
service revenue.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Costs and Expenses</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Cost of services and products consists largely of incollect expense
(whereby CBW incurs costs associated with its subscribers using their
handsets while in the territories of other wireless service providers),
network operations costs, interconnection expenses and cost of equipment
sold. These costs were $110.5&nbsp;million during 2003, or 43% of revenue,
compared to $119.5&nbsp;million, or 45% of revenue in 2002. In total, cost of
services and products decreased $9.0&nbsp;million, or 8%, during 2003 compared
to 2002. These declines were due primarily to decreased incollect
charges of $2.1&nbsp;million related to postpaid subscribership, decreased
operating taxes of $4.1&nbsp;million and $4.7 million from cost
reductions because the Wireless segment assumed
responsibility for network management services previously outsourced to
AWE.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SG&#038;A expenses include the cost of customer acquisition, which consists
primarily of advertising, distribution and promotional expenses. These
expenses increased by $2.7&nbsp;million in 2003 compared to 2002 due to an
increase in advertising of $2.1&nbsp;million and employee-related expenses of
$3.5&nbsp;million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad
debt expense of $2.7&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">CPGA, a measure of the Company&#146;s cost to
acquire new customers, was $389 for 2003, a $25, or 7%, increase over
2002. The increase is due to higher advertising and handset subsidies cost
in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase in handset subsidies per gross
addition was driven by an increase in handset upgrades by existing
subscribers and the initial sale of GSM handsets to large resellers. In
both instances, equipment sales increased handset subsidy costs, without a
corresponding

2003, which was equal to the prior year amount.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Depreciation expense of $38.3&nbsp;million increased $7.7&nbsp;million, or 25%, in 2003
compared to 2002 as a result of $5.2&nbsp;million in accelerated depreciation
related to the change in estimated economic useful life of the TDMA network to
December&nbsp;31, 2006. The Company expects depreciation expense to increase
approximately $21.0&nbsp;million in 2004 compared to 2003 related to the accelerated
depreciation of the TDMA network.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Operating Income</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As a result of the above, operating income decreased $8.9&nbsp;million, or 13%, to
$60.2&nbsp;million and operating margin decreased 3 points to 23.2% in 2003 compared
to 2002. The Company expects operating income declines in 2004 as a result of
accelerated subscribership growth and its related sales and marketing expense
and increased depreciation of its TDMA network.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2002 Compared to 2001</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Wireless segment revenue increased 5%, or $12.8&nbsp;million, to $267.2&nbsp;million in
2002 compared to 2001. Postpaid service revenue contributed approximately
$16.1&nbsp;million to revenue growth as the average subscriber base grew 16% in
2002. The increase was offset by a decrease in prepaid service revenue and
lower equipment sales.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Postpaid subscribership remained flat at 311,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2002,
compared to December&nbsp;31, 2001 and represented 18% of the total postpaid market
share within the Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio metropolitan areas. ARPU
from postpaid subscribers of $58.75 in 2002 decreased $2.48 compared to 2001
due to pricing pressure from increasing competition, higher penetration rates
among lower usage subscribers and reduced usage as a result of the difficult
economic environment. Average monthly customer churn remained low in the face
of aggressive competition at 1.73% for postpaid subscribers in 2002 compared to
1.56% in 2001. Postpaid service revenue decreased 5% in the fourth quarter of
2002 compared to the third quarter of 2002, due to a decrease in minutes of
use, decrease in subscribership, and decrease in market share. Postpaid
services experienced net deactivations totaling 5,200 subscribers during the
second half of 2002. Subscribership declined from 314,000 at the end of the
third quarter of 2002 to 311,000 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2002.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Prepaid service revenue declined 5%, or $1.8&nbsp;million, in 2002 compared to
2001 due to a decline in minutes of use. Subscribership to CBW&#146;s
i-wireless<SUP>SM</SUP> prepaid product grew from approximately 151,000 subscribers at
the end of 2001 to approximately 159,000, or approximately 9% of the
prepaid wireless market, at the end of 2002. i-wireless<SUP>SM</SUP> represents an
efficient use of CBW&#146;s wireless network, as these subscribers generally
make use of the network during off-peak periods. In addition, the CPGA of
$64 for i-wireless<SUP>SM</SUP> subscribers during 2002 was only 18% of the CPGA for
postpaid subscribers during 2002.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Equipment revenue declined nearly $1.5&nbsp;million, or 10%, in 2002 due to a

compared to 2001. The decrease resulted from a decrease in handset
subsidies due to fewer handset promotions in 2002 than in 2001 and a
decrease in gross activations.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SG&#038;A expenses include the cost of customer acquisition, which consists
primarily of advertising, distribution and promotional expenses. These
costs decreased by $9.6&nbsp;million, or 17%, in 2002, compared to 2001. The
decrease resulted from a decrease in advertising of $3.7&nbsp;million,
promotional spending of $3.3&nbsp;million and employee-related expenses of $0.9
million. SG&#038;A expenses continued to decrease significantly as a percentage
of total revenue, declining from 22% of revenue in 2001 to 17% of revenue
in 2002 as the Company continued to focus on profitability and cash flow.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Depreciation expense of $30.6&nbsp;million increased $5.3&nbsp;million, or 21%, in 2002

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Wireless segment continued significant operating income improvements as
the Company optimized its network investment and benefited from an embedded
customer base and low customer churn. In 2002, operating income of $69.1
million represented a $31.4&nbsp;million, or 83%, improvement over 2001.
Additionally, operating margin in 2002 increased 11 points from 2001 to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Other segment revenue of $81.1&nbsp;million in 2003 decreased $1.7&nbsp;million, or 2%,
compared to 2002.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">CBAD&#146;s revenue declined $0.6&nbsp;million, or 1%, in 2003 as price increases
initiated in 2003 on its &#147;Any Distance&#148; long distance service offering were
more than offset by a 10% decline in minutes of use in response to
intense competition, including further penetration of wireless plans with
free long distance. CBAD had 539,000 subscribed access lines as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003 in the Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio operating areas,
representing a decrease of 15,800 lines, or 3%, versus December&nbsp;31, 2002, which
the Company believes is primarily related to its access line loss in its local
businesses. In spite of subscriber line decreases, the Company&#146;s market
share has increased as a function of the Local segment&#146;s lines in service for
which a long distance carrier has been chosen for residential and business
access lines. CBAD&#146;s residential and business market share increased in 2003
to approximately 71% and 45%, respectively, from 69% and 43%, respectively at
the end of 2002. Public revenue declined $1.1&nbsp;million, or 8%, compared to
2002 in response to further penetration of wireless communications offset
partially by a favorable $0.4&nbsp;million settlement with a major
interexchange carrier.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Costs and Expenses</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Cost of services and products totaled $54.1&nbsp;million in 2003, representing a
decrease of 15% compared to 2002. The decrease in cost of services was due
primarily to decreased access charges at CBAD of $4.2&nbsp;million as minutes of use
declined. In 2003, CBAD purchased its wholesale minutes from the buyer of the
broadband assets, based on an agreement signed in conjunction with the asset
sale. Public also contributed decreases of $4.2&nbsp;million in 2003, as a result
of a favorable settlement with a major interexchange carrier and removal of
unprofitable stations.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SG&#038;A expenses decreased $1.0&nbsp;million, or 7%, in 2003 compared to 2002. These
decreases were incurred primarily at CBAD as a result of a decrease in payroll
and related expenses partially offset by an increase in billing and collection
expenses.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Public incurred a $3.6&nbsp;million asset impairment in 2003 to
write-down the value of its public payphone assets to fair value.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Operating Income</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As a result of the above, the Other segment reported operating income of $6.5
million in 2003, an increase of $4.8&nbsp;million compared to 2002. Operating
margin showed similar improvements, increasing six points from a margin of 2.1%
in 2002 to 8.0% in 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2002 Compared to 2001</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Other segment revenue increased 5% to $82.8&nbsp;million in 2002 compared to $79.0
million in 2001. CBAD revenue increased by 8%, or $5.2&nbsp;million, in 2002
compared to 2001 based primarily on the growth of its &#147;Any Distance&#148; long
distance service offering. Any Distance had 555,000 subscribed access lines as
of December&nbsp;31, 2002 compared to 550,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2001 in the
Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio operating area, representing residential and
business market shares of approximately 69% and 43% of total access lines,
respectively. Revenue from Public declined 11%, or $1.7&nbsp;million in 2002,
versus 2001, partially offsetting the

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">revenue increase from CBAD, as payphone usage continued to decline as a result of continued penetration of wireless
communications.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Costs and Expenses</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Cost of services and products totaled $63.4&nbsp;million in 2002, representing an 8%
increase over 2001. The increase in cost of services was due primarily to
increased access charges related to an 8% increase in minutes of use, and
personnel costs of CBAD as volume continued to grow. In 2002, approximately
$43.2&nbsp;million, or 89%, of CBAD costs were for access charges compared to approximately $41.4&nbsp;million,
or 93%, in 2001.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SG&#038;A expenses decreased $5.8&nbsp;million, or 27%, during 2002 compared to 2001.
Nearly all of the decrease was due to the relatively high advertising costs of
$3.3&nbsp;million incurred to acquire approximately 4,400 net customers at CBAD during
2001, which was not repeated in 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Operating Income</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Operating income improved to $1.7&nbsp;million in 2002, a $5.4&nbsp;million increase
compared to the operating loss reported in 2001. Operating margin experienced
a similar improvement, increasing from negative 4.7% in 2001 to positive 2.1%
in 2002, a seven point increase. Improvements during 2002 were primarily the
result of decreased advertising and other marketing expenses at CBAD.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Broadband</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On February&nbsp;22, 2003, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell
substantially all of its broadband assets. In accordance with SFAS 144, the
Company ceased depreciating the assets to be sold upon entering into the
definitive agreement. On June&nbsp;6, 2003 and June&nbsp;13, 2003, the purchase
agreement was amended to, among other things, reduce the purchase price,
subject to certain purchase price adjustments and other post-closing
obligations and eliminate certain of the conditions to the consummation of the
first stage closing of the sale.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On June&nbsp;13, 2003, the first (and most significant) stage closing was
consummated. At the first stage closing, the Company had received regulatory
approval in states where approximately 75% of 2002 broadband revenue was
generated and effectively transferred control of the broadband business to the
buyer. The buyer paid the initial cash purchase price of $91.5&nbsp;million, of
which $29.3&nbsp;million was placed into escrow to support certain purchase price
adjustments and the portion of the purchase price payable upon the consummation
of the second and third stage closings.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">During the third quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, the second and third (final)
stage closings were consummated as all remaining regulatory approvals had been
received. In connection with these closings, the Company received $20.5
million of the $29.3&nbsp;million escrowed funds. Subsequently, the Company returned
$0.5&nbsp;million of the purchase price and released the remaining escrowed funds of
$8.8&nbsp;million to the buyer in satisfaction of the working capital and
receivables post-closing purchase price adjustments pursuant to an agreement
between the Company and the buyer to settle such amounts.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Subsequent to the closing of the asset sale, the Broadband segment consists of
Cincinnati Bell Technology Solutions (&#147;CBTS&#148;) (an IT consulting, data
collocation and managed services business), together with certain liabilities
not transferred to the buyers. Prior to the sale of the broadband assets,
revenue for the Broadband segment was generated from broadband transport (which
included revenue from IRU&#146;s), switched voice services, data and Internet
services (including data collocation and managed services), information
technology consulting and other services. These transport and switched voice
services were generally provided over the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2003 Compared to 2002</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Broadband segment revenue decreased significantly in 2003 due to the sale of
substantially all of the Company&#146;s broadband assets on June&nbsp;13, 2003. In the
second half of 2003, the Broadband segment included only the revenue of CBTS.
CBTS contributed revenue of $116.8&nbsp;million in 2003, consisting of $95.3&nbsp;million
for IT consulting and $21.5&nbsp;million in data and Internet services such as
collocation and managed services compared to revenue of $163.9&nbsp;million in 2002,
consisting of $143.7&nbsp;million for IT consulting and $20.2&nbsp;million in data and
Internet services. IT consulting revenue was $48.4&nbsp;million, or 34%, lower than
in the prior year due to difficult economic conditions and decreases in capital
spending by CBTS&#146; customers. CBTS&#146; data and Internet revenue was $21.5
million, or 6%, higher in 2003 compared to 2002. CBTS revenue from services and
hardware sales comprised 44% and 56%, respectively in 2003, compared to 31% and
69%, respectively, in 2002. On March&nbsp;10, 2004, CBTS entered into a definitive
agreement to sell certain of its assets. The Company expects CBTS revenue to
decrease approximately $60.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003 due to the sale
of these assets.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Prior to the aforementioned sale of the broadband assets, the Broadband segment
also had revenue from broadband transport, voice long distance and other data
and Internet products and service such as ATM/frame relay and dedicated and
dial-up IP. As a result, all of the year-to-date variances discussed below are
affected by the disposition of these assets, as 2002 amounts included a full
year of revenue related to these products and services. Variances are also
affected by other external factors, which are mentioned specifically below.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">




<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Broadband transport revenue was $159.3&nbsp;million in 2003, or $302.3&nbsp;million lower
than in 2002, due to the sale and lower demand for dedicated optical and
digital circuits from both established and emerging carriers. In addition, as
a result of an IRU contract termination in 2002, $58.7&nbsp;million of
non-cash revenue was recognized in broadband transport revenue
in 2002, which did not recur in 2003. Switched voice services revenue of
$111.9&nbsp;million in 2003 was $224.0&nbsp;million lower than 2002, due to the sale and
the Company&#146;s exit of the international switched wholesale voice business as part of its October
2002 restructuring. Due to the sale of the broadband business, the Company
expects Broadband segment revenue related to broadband transport and switched
voice services to be zero going forward.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Data and Internet revenue decreased $52.4&nbsp;million, or 39%, in 2003 compared to
2002. These decreases were partially due to an anticipated decline in revenue
related to the exit of the bundled Internet access services. Refer to Note 6
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining decrease was
due to the sale of the underlying assets of the data and internet products in
connection with the sale of the broadband assets on June&nbsp;13, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Costs and Expenses</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Cost of services and products primarily reflects access charges paid to local
exchange carriers and other providers, transmission lease payments to other
carriers, costs incurred for network construction projects and personnel and
hardware costs for IT consulting. In the second half of 2003, the Broadband
segment included only the cost of services and products of CBTS. CBTS incurred
$93.5&nbsp;million of cost of services and products in 2003, which represented a
decrease of $42.6&nbsp;million compared to 2002 due to the related decrease in
revenue discussed above.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Excluding CBTS, cost of services and products decreased $316.8&nbsp;million compared
to 2002. The majority of the decreases were the result of the sale of
substantially all of the broadband assets. The remaining decreases were driven
primarily by lower broadband transport and switched voice services and include
cost reductions implemented as part of the October&nbsp;2002 restructuring plan. In
addition, a charge of $13.3&nbsp;million in construction contract termination costs
was recorded in 2002 and not repeated in 2003. The decreases were also
partially offset by an increase in local access charges associated with the
Company&#146;s continued penetration of enterprise customer accounts. Costs of
services and products incurred by the Broadband segment are expected to
decrease significantly going forward as a substantial portion of the underlying
assets were sold in connection with the sale of the broadband assets on June
13, 2003.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SG&#038;A expenses decreased 53% to $144.5&nbsp;million in 2003 compared to 2002. The
SG&#038;A expenses decrease associated with the sale of substantially all of the
broadband assets was $159.3&nbsp;million. The remaining decrease was attributable to
lower transmission operating expenses of $26.6&nbsp;million, lower property taxes of
$14.6&nbsp;million and lower bad debt expense of $10.5&nbsp;million. These decreases were partially offset by an
increase in contract services related to outsourcing of certain invoice
processing of $5.6&nbsp;million, an increase in pension expense and a decrease in
capitalized overhead costs associated with the completion of the national
optical network of $7.5&nbsp;million. Legal and other
expenses associated with retained liabilities of the broadband business
amounted to approximately $7.9&nbsp;million in second half of 2003. SG&#038;A expenses
incurred by the Broadband segment are expected to decrease significantly going
forward as a substantial portion of the underlying assets were sold in
connection with the sale of the broadband assets on June&nbsp;13, 2003.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Depreciation expense has been effectively eliminated, dropping 99% to $2.5
million in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease was due to a non-cash
impairment charge of $2,200.0&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2002 related

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">to the Broadband segment&#146;s tangible and intangible assets (refer to Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, due to the
definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of the Broadband
segment, the Broadband assets were classified as held for sale as of March&nbsp;1,
2003 and the Broadband segment ceased depreciating the assets held for sale in
accordance with SFAS 144 (refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements). As such, the Company expects an immaterial amount of
depreciation expense from the Broadband segment going forward.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Amortization expense, which related to intangible assets acquired as part of
the purchase of the broadband business in 1999, decreased to zero in 2003,
versus $24.8&nbsp;million in the prior year. This is due to the write-
down of $298.3&nbsp;million of intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2002 as
part of the $2,200.0&nbsp;million non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by the
Broadband segment as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Restructuring charges during 2003 were $43.6&nbsp;million lower than in 2002.
Restructuring charges in 2003 consist of an $11.0&nbsp;million reversal of
previously recorded restructuring expense due to settlements related to
contract terminations and a reversal due to a change in estimate related to
terminations of contractual obligations. The $32.6&nbsp;million of restructuring
charges in 2002 were comprised of $15.9&nbsp;million recorded in the first quarter
of 2002 for employee termination benefits and the termination of a contractual
commitment with a vendor related to the November&nbsp;2001 restructuring, $5.5
million recorded in the third quarter of 2002 primarily for restructuring
charges associated with the exit of bundled Internet access services and $12.8
million during the fourth quarter of 2002 for employee severance and contract
termination costs. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In February&nbsp;2004, the Company settled an arbitration proceeding
between a customer and the Company&#146;s subsidiary Broadwing Communications Services
Inc. (&#147;BCSI&#148;) regarding a broadband network construction contract entered into
in 2000. As part of the settlement, both parties agreed to drop their
respective claims for monetary damages. In 2003, the Company recorded a $5.2
million charge in &#147;Asset impairments and other charges&#148; as a result of this
settlement.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In conjunction with the sale of substantially all of the broadband assets, the
Broadband segment recorded a gain of $336.7&nbsp;million
during 2003. A detailed discussion of the sale of the broadband assets is
provided in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Operating Income</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As a result of the above, operating income in 2003 increased by $2,786.2
million compared to 2002, from a loss of $2,437.6&nbsp;million in 2002 to operating
income of $348.6&nbsp;million in 2003. Operating income (loss)&nbsp;from the Broadband
segment is expected to be immaterial going forward.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2002 Compared to 2001</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Broadband transport services consisted of long-haul transmission of data, voice
and Internet traffic over dedicated circuits. Revenue from the broadband
transport category was mainly generated by private line monthly recurring
revenue. However, approximately 44% and 29% of broadband transport revenue in
2002 and 2001, respectively, was provided by IRU agreements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Broadband transport revenue decreased $4.9&nbsp;million in 2002, or 1%, to $461.6
million compared to 2001. The decrease was due to lower dedicated optical and
digital circuit revenue as demand from both established and

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">emerging carriers continued to decline. This decrease was substantially offset
by $58.7&nbsp;million in non-cash revenue from the termination of IRU
contracts with two of the Company&#146;s customers who filed for Chapter&nbsp;11
bankruptcy protection.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Switched voice services revenue decreased 12% in 2002 compared to 2001, from
$383.1&nbsp;million to $335.9&nbsp;million. The decrease in revenue was the result of
the Company&#146;s continued focus on higher margin business and declining rates and
volume due to intense competition, partially offset by a reduction in
uncollectible revenue due to tightened credit policies. CBAD resells voice
long distance in its local franchise area, which contributed switched voice
revenue to the Broadband segment of $43&nbsp;million in 2002 and $41&nbsp;million in
2001. The Company initiated a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of
2002, which included exiting the international switched wholesale voice
business. The international switched wholesale voice business accounted for
$75&nbsp;million and $94&nbsp;million of revenue during 2002 and 2001, respectively.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Data and Internet revenue increased $11.0&nbsp;million, or 9%, over 2001 on the
strength of demand for dedicated IP and ATM/frame relay services. These
increases were partially offset by a decrease in equipment sales, a decrease in
revenue related to the exit of the bundled Internet access product, and a decrease in
data collocation revenue, as the Company closed eight of its eleven data
centers as part of its November&nbsp;2001 restructuring.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">IT consulting revenue grew $2.4&nbsp;million, or 2%, during 2002 compared to 2001.
The growth was attributable to increased sales of hardware and consulting
services. Revenue from services and hardware sales comprised 21% and 79%,
respectively, of total IT consulting revenue during both 2002 and 2001.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Network construction and other services revenue decreased $55.5&nbsp;million, or
98%, during 2002 compared to 2001. As further discussed in Note 6 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company&#146;s November&nbsp;2001 restructuring
plan included plans to exit the network construction business upon completion
of a large project. The contract for that project was in dispute but was
subsequently settled as discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Costs and Expenses</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Cost of services and products primarily reflects access charges paid to local
exchange carriers and other providers, transmission lease payments to other
carriers, costs incurred for network construction projects and personnel and
hardware costs for IT consulting. In 2002, cost of services and products
amounted to $655.6&nbsp;million, a 15% decrease compared to the $775.3&nbsp;million
incurred during 2001. The decrease was driven primarily by lower switched
voice services and network construction activity and cost reductions
implemented as part of the November&nbsp;2001 restructuring plan. The decreases
were partially offset by an increase in local access charges associated with
the Company&#146;s continued penetration of enterprise customer accounts and a
charge of $13.3&nbsp;million for costs associated with the termination
of the Company&#146;s uncompleted network construction contract. Refer to Note 11
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of
this contract.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">SG&#038;A expenses decreased 7% to $308.3&nbsp;million in 2002 compared to 2001. The
decrease was due primarily to a decrease in employee costs of $61.9&nbsp;million, as
headcount was approximately 660 lower at December&nbsp;31, 2002 than at December&nbsp;31,
2001, and lower marketing expenses of $41.8&nbsp;million. These decreases were
offset by a decrease in capitalized overhead costs associated with the
completion of the Company&#146;s national optical network.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Depreciation expense of $291.1&nbsp;million increased $17.7&nbsp;million, or 6% in 2002
compared to 2001 as a result of placing assets related to the optical network
overbuild into service.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Amortization expense, which in 2001 primarily related to the amortization of
goodwill as a result of the merger, decreased 78% to $24.8&nbsp;million in 2002 from
$110.7&nbsp;million in 2001. Upon adoption of SFAS 142 as required on January&nbsp;1,
2002, the Company stopped amortizing goodwill.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">During the first quarter of 2002, the Broadband segment recorded restructuring
charges of $15.9&nbsp;million resulting from employee separation benefits and costs
to terminate contractual obligations, which were actions contemplated in the
November&nbsp;2001 restructuring plan for which an amount could not be reasonably
estimated at that time. During the fourth quarter of 2002, a $1&nbsp;million
reversal was made to the restructuring reserve due to a change in estimate
related to the termination of contractual obligations. In total, the Company
expects the November&nbsp;2001 restructuring plan to result in cash outlays of $88.1
million and non-cash items of $148.8&nbsp;million. The Company completed the plan
as of December&nbsp;31, 2002, except for certain lease obligations, which are
expected to continue through December&nbsp;31, 2015. Refer to
Note&nbsp;6 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">During the third quarter of 2002, the Broadband segment recorded restructuring
charges of $5.5&nbsp;million.
In October&nbsp;2002, the Company initiated a restructuring of the Broadband segment
that was intended to reduce annual expenses by approximately $200&nbsp;million
compared to 2002 and enable the Broadband segment to become cash flow positive.
The plan included initiatives to reduce the workforce by approximately 500
positions; reduce line costs through network grooming, optimization, and rate
negotiations; and exit the international wholesale voice business. The
Broadband segment recorded a cash restructuring charge of approximately $12.8
million during the fourth quarter of 2002 for employee severance and contract
termination costs.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Based on certain indicators, including the potential sale of substantially all
of the broadband assets, the Company performed an impairment analysis of the
assets of its Broadband segment in the fourth quarter of 2002. The impairment
analysis indicated that the carrying value of the assets was not recoverable.
Accordingly, the Broadband segment wrote down the assets to estimated fair
market value, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $2.2&nbsp;billion.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Operating Loss</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The operating loss of $2,437.6&nbsp;million recorded in 2002 represents a $1,889.7
million increase over the $547.9&nbsp;million operating loss in 2001. The increase
in the operating loss is due to the asset impairment charge of approximately

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Background</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had $2,287.8&nbsp;million of outstanding
indebtedness (net of unamortized discount) and an accumulated deficit of
$3,604.2&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In November of 1999, the Company acquired IXC Communications, Inc. (IXC)&nbsp;for
approximately $3,200.0&nbsp;million. IXC, subsequently renamed BRCOM (f/k/a
Broadwing Communications Inc.), provided long haul voice, data, and internet
service over an 18,700 mile optic network. In connection with the acquisition,
the Company assumed approximately $1,000.0&nbsp;million of debt. Also in November
1999, the Company obtained credit facilities totaling $1,800.0&nbsp;million from a
group of lending institutions. These credit facilities were increased to
$2,100.0&nbsp;million in January&nbsp;2001 and again to $2,300.0&nbsp;million in June&nbsp;2001.
Borrowings under these facilities were used to redeem approximately $404.0
million of BRCOM 9% Senior Subordinated Notes assumed as part of the
acquisition through a tender offer as a result of the change of control terms
of the bond indenture. Additionally, in July of 1999, the Company issued
$400.0&nbsp;million of convertible subordinated notes (the &#147;Convertible
Subordinated Notes&#148;) to Oak Hill Capital Partners, L.P. The proceeds were used
to pay down IXC commercial paper outstanding and to purchase shares of IXC
stock. From the acquisition of BRCOM through June&nbsp;2003, the Company used a
total of approximately $2,300.0&nbsp;million of both cash flow from its other
businesses and borrowings under its credit facilities, to finance the buildout
of BRCOM&#146;s national optical network and to meet BRCOM&#146;s other cash needs. In
2001, the business environment for BRCOM and the broader telecommunications
industry deteriorated rapidly and significantly.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As a result of the acquisition of BRCOM, the Company incurred substantial
operating and net losses. In 2000 and 2001, BRCOM had operating losses of
$230.5&nbsp;million and $547.9&nbsp;million, respectively, and net losses of $467.7
million and $417.8&nbsp;million, respectively. In 2002, BRCOM had an operating loss
of $2,437.6&nbsp;million and a net loss of $4,560.4&nbsp;million, which included an asset
impairment charge of $2,200.0&nbsp;million and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge
of $2,008.7&nbsp;million recorded upon the adoption of SFAS 142.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In response to BRCOM&#146;s deteriorating financial results and concerns over
liquidity, in October&nbsp;2002, the Company announced a five-point restructuring
plan intended to strengthen the Company&#146;s financial position, maintain the
strength and stability of its local telephone business, reduce capital
expenditures at BRCOM, facilitate the evaluation of strategic alternatives
related to BRCOM and reduce debt. Throughout 2003, as result of the
execution of this plan, the Company completed the sale of BRCOM&#146;s broadband
business, secured additional sources of capital, amended its credit facilities
and completed the exchange of debt and preferred stock at BRCOM, as further
discussed below.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Broadband Asset Sale</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On February&nbsp;22, 2003, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell
substantially all of its broadband assets. On June&nbsp;6, 2003 and June&nbsp;13, 2003, the
purchase agreement was amended to, among other things, reduce the initial purchase
price to $108.7&nbsp;million ($91.5&nbsp;million in cash and an estimated $17.2&nbsp;million
preliminary working capital promissory note, which was ultimately reduced to
zero based on the final working capital position of the broadband business).


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On June&nbsp;13, 2003, the first (and most significant) stage closing was
consummated. At the first stage closing, the Company had received regulatory
approval in states where approximately 75% of 2002 broadband revenue was
generated and effectively transferred control of the broadband business to the
buyer. The buyer paid the initial cash purchase price of $91.5&nbsp;million, of
which $29.3&nbsp;million was placed into escrow to support certain potential
purchase price adjustments and the portion of the purchase price payable upon
the consummation of the second and third stage closings.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">During the third quarter of 2003, the second and third (final)&nbsp;stage closings
were consummated as all remaining regulatory approvals were received. In
connection with these closings, the Company received $20.5&nbsp;million
of the $29.3&nbsp;million escrowed funds. Subsequently, the Company released the remaining escrowed funds of $8.8
million to the buyer along with an additional $0.5&nbsp;million in cash in
satisfaction of the working capital and receivables post closing purchase price
adjustments pursuant to the purchase agreement between the Company and the
buyer.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company has indemnified the buyer of the broadband business against certain
potential claims. In order to determine the fair value of the indemnification
obligation, the Company performed a probability-weighted discounted cash flow
analysis, utilizing the minimum and maximum potential claims and several
scenarios within the range of possibilities. Such analysis resulted in an
estimated fair value of the indemnification obligation of $7.8&nbsp;million, which
is included in other liabilities and has been reflected as a reduction of the
gain on sale of broadband assets in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Not more than 30&nbsp;days after July&nbsp;1, 2004, the buyer will provide the BRCOM
selling subsidiaries with a calculation of cash EBITDA (as defined in the asset
purchase agreement) minus capital expenditures for the broadband business for
the period from July&nbsp;1, 2003 to July&nbsp;1, 2004. If annual cash EBITDA minus
capital expenditures for such period is negative $48&nbsp;million or less, the BRCOM
selling subsidiaries will pay to the buyers an amount equal to 35% of the
difference between negative $48&nbsp;million and the amount of annual cash EBITDA
minus capital expenditures, provided that the obligation for such reimbursement
will not exceed $10&nbsp;million. The Company has recorded a $10&nbsp;million liability
related to this purchase price adjustment. The BRCOM selling subsidiaries will
have no obligation to make the foregoing payment if the buyers sell 51% or more
of the equity or voting control of the acquiring entity or the assets acquired
in the broadband sale.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Exchange and Retirement of BRCOM Debt and Preferred Stock</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In March&nbsp;2003, the Company reached agreements with holders of more than
two-thirds of BRCOM&#146;s 12&#189;% Preferred Stock (the &#147;12&#189;% Preferreds&#148;) and
9% notes to exchange these instruments for common stock of the Company. On
September&nbsp;8, 2003, the Company exchanged these instruments for 25.2&nbsp;million
shares of common stock of the Company. These exchanges resulted in the
retirement of $458.4&nbsp;million of long-term debt and minority interest
liabilities of the Company. The exchanges also resulted in the non-cash
settlement of $66.5&nbsp;million in accrued interest and dividends as the Company
had deferred the August&nbsp;15, 2002, November&nbsp;15, 2002, February&nbsp;15, 2003, May&nbsp;15,
2003, and August&nbsp;15, 2003 cash dividend payments on the 12&#189;% Preferreds, in
accordance with the terms of the security. Upon completion of the exchange and
a related subsidiary merger, the indenture related to the 9% notes was
terminated and there were no longer any shares of the 12&#189;% Preferreds
outstanding.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On June&nbsp;16, 2003, the Company permanently retired BRCOM&#146;s remaining $0.8
million outstanding 12&#189;% Senior Notes due 2005.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Financing Transactions and Credit Facilities</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On March&nbsp;26, 2003, the Company received $350.0&nbsp;million of gross cash proceeds
from the issuance of the 16% notes. Proceeds from the 16% notes, net of fees,
were used to pay down borrowings under the Company&#146;s credit facilities.
Interest on the 16% notes is payable semi-annually on June&nbsp;30 and December&nbsp;31,
whereby 12% is paid in cash and 4% is accreted on the aggregate principal
amount. In addition, purchasers of the 16% notes received 17.5&nbsp;million common
stock warrants, each to purchase one share of Cincinnati Bell Inc. common stock
at $3.00 each, which expire in March&nbsp;2013. Of the total gross proceeds
received, $47.5&nbsp;million was allocated

the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and was recorded as a discount on the
16% notes. The 16% notes are expected to increase annual interest expense by
approximately $17.5&nbsp;million in 2004 compared to 2003, of which approximately
$11.8&nbsp;million is cash.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In conjunction with the issuance of the 16% notes, the Company&#146;s credit
facilities were also amended to, among other things, extend the revolving
credit commitment, revise the financial covenants, accelerate a portion of the
term debt, increase interest rate spreads and allow for the sale of
substantially all of the assets of the Broadband segment.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Also, in March&nbsp;2003, the Company entered into a supplemental indenture amending
certain terms governing the Convertible Subordinated Notes Due 2009. The
supplemental indenture allowed for the previously discussed sale of
substantially all of the assets of the Company&#146;s Broadband segment, provided
that a bankruptcy of BRCOM would not constitute an event of default, amended
the definition of change in control by increasing the ownership threshold
deemed to be a change in control from 20% of outstanding shares to 45% of
outstanding shares and included covenants restricting the ability of the
Company to incur debt and consummate certain asset dispositions. The
supplemental indenture also increased the paid-in-kind interest by 2&#188;% from
March&nbsp;2003 through scheduled redemption in July&nbsp;2009, resulting in a per annum
interest rate of 9%. In November&nbsp;2003, the Company purchased and retired all
of the outstanding Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009, at a discounted
price equal to 97% of their accreted value. The retirement of the Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2009 is expected to decrease annual non-cash interest
expense in 2004 compared to 2003 by $38.1&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On July&nbsp;11, 2003, the Company issued $500.0&nbsp;million of 7&#188;% senior unsecured
notes due 2013 (the &#147;7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013&#148;). Net proceeds of $488.8
million were used to prepay term credit facilities and permanently reduce
commitments under the Company&#146;s revolving credit facility. Interest on the
7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013 will be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears
on January&nbsp;15 and July&nbsp;15 of each year, commencing on January&nbsp;15, 2004. The
7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013 are unsecured obligations and will rank equally
with all of the Company&#146;s existing and future senior unsecured debt and will
rank senior to all existing and future subordinated debt. The Company&#146;s
subsidiaries, excluding Cincinnati Bell Telephone, Cincinnati Bell Wireless,
and BRCOM and all of its subsidiaries except CBAD, unconditionally guarantee
the 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013 on a senior unsecured basis. The
indenture governing the 7&#188;%
Senior notes due 2013 contains customary covenants for notes of this type,
including limitations on the following: dividends and other restricted
payments; dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries;
indebtedness; asset dispositions; transactions with affiliates; liens;
investments; issuances and sales of capital stock of subsidiaries; redemption
of debt that is junior in right of payment; issuances of senior subordinated
debt; restrictions on dealing with BRCOM and its subsidiaries; and, mergers and
consolidations. The 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013 are expected to increase
interest expense in 2004 by approximately $19.2&nbsp;million compared to 2003. In
conjunction with issuing the 7&#188;% Senior Notes due 2013, the Company also
amended its credit facility to allow for the issuance of the notes and to reset
the interest coverage covenants.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">On
November&nbsp;19, 2003, the Company issued $540.0&nbsp;million of 8 3/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes (&#147;the 8 3/8% notes&#148;). The net proceeds, after deducting the
initial purchasers&#146; discounts and fees and expenses, totaled $528.2&nbsp;million.
The Company used $524.6&nbsp;million of the net proceeds to purchase all of the
Company&#146;s outstanding Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009, which bore
interest at a rate of 9%, at a discounted price equal to 97% of their accreted
value. The remaining proceeds were used to pay fees related to a credit
facility amendment discussed below and to reduce outstanding borrowings under
the revolving credit facility. Concurrently with the issuance of the 8 3/8% notes,
the Company amended its credit facilities to provide for a new term loan
facility of $525.0&nbsp;million and to reset the interest coverage ratio covenants.
The net proceeds of the new term loan facility were used to prepay all
outstanding term loans under the Company&#146;s credit facilities and to permanently
pay down a portion of the Company&#146;s revolving credit facility. The new term
loan matures

LIBOR. The 8 3/8% notes are expected to increase interest expense in 2004 by
approximately $40.1&nbsp;million compared to 2003.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company believes that its borrowing availability under the credit
facilities and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity
for the foreseeable future. As a result of the issuance of the 16% notes, the
7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013 and scheduled repayments, the credit facilities
were reduced from $1,825.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2002 to $920.5&nbsp;million as
of December&nbsp;31, 2003. The remaining credit facilities as of December&nbsp;31, 2003
consist of $396.8&nbsp;million in revolving credit maturing on March&nbsp;1, 2006, and
having four equal quarterly scheduled commitment reductions during 2005 in an
aggregate amount equal to $123.3&nbsp;million, and $523.7&nbsp;million in term loans,
maturing on June&nbsp;30, 2008. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the
Company had drawn approximately $608.4&nbsp;million from its credit facilities, and
had outstanding letters of credit totaling $12.6&nbsp;million, leaving $299.5
million in additional borrowing availability under its revolving credit
facility.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The terms of the 16% notes, the 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013,
the 8 3/8% notes and the credit facilities limit the Company&#146;s ability to make future
investments in or fund the operations of BRCOM and its subsidiaries.
Specifically, the Company and its other subsidiaries may not make investments
in or fund the operations of BRCOM and its subsidiaries beyond an aggregate
amount of $118.0&nbsp;million after October&nbsp;1, 2002. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the
Company had the ability to invest an additional $79.8&nbsp;million in BRCOM and its
subsidiaries based on these provisions. In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2003,
the Company&#146;s unrestricted BRCOM subsidiaries had assets of $570.2&nbsp;million
($26.8&nbsp;million excluding deferred tax assets and intercompany accounts
receivable) and liabilities of $275.9&nbsp;million ($90.6&nbsp;million excluding
intercompany accounts payable). The Company believes that BRCOM&#146;s available
liquidity is sufficient to meets its remaining obligations.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Upon completion of the previously referenced amendment to the credit facilities
in November&nbsp;2003, interest rates charged on borrowings under the revolving and
term credit facilities were 425 and 250 basis points above the London Interbank
Offered Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;), respectively, or 5.40% and 3.65%, respectively, based
on the LIBOR rate as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. Based on the Company&#146;s variable
rate indebtedness as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, if the Company&#146;s credit facility
were fully drawn, a 1% increase in the average borrowing rate would result in
approximately $9.2&nbsp;million in annual incremental interest expense. The
commitment fees applied to the unused amount of revolving credit facility
borrowings are 62.5 basis points. Due to this amendment and repayments with
respect to the outstanding credit facilities in 2003, the Company expects
annual interest expense related to the credit facilities to decrease interest
expense by approximately $48.8&nbsp;million in 2004 compared to 2003, of which
approximately $28.0&nbsp;million will be a decrease in cash interest.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company is subject to financial covenants in association with the credit
facilities. These financial covenants require that the Company maintain
certain debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility agreement), senior
secured debt to EBITDA and interest coverage ratios as well as limit its
capital expenditures. The facilities also contain certain covenants which,
among other things, may restrict the Company&#146;s ability to incur additional debt
or liens, pay dividends, repurchase Company common stock, sell, transfer,
lease, or dispose of assets and make investments or merge with another company.
If the Company were to violate any of its covenants and was unable to obtain a
waiver, it would be considered a default. If the Company were in default under
its credit facilities, no additional borrowings under the credit facilities
would be available until the default was waived or cured. The Company was in
compliance with all financial covenants set forth in its credit facilities and the
indentures governing its other debt as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. As a result of
the restatement of the Company&#146;s previously issued financial statements,
discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Company was in default on its Credit Agreement and 16% Notes Indenture, and as
a result of cross-default provisions, the Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes. In
March&nbsp;2004, the Credit Agreement and 16% Notes Indenture were amended to
provide that the restatement does not constitute an event of default, which

that Convergys will be the primary provider of certain data processing,
professional and consulting, technical support and customer support services
for the Company. In return, the Company will be the exclusive provider of
local telecommunications services to Convergys. In 2003, the Company signed a
letter of intent to revise the contract, which would extend the contract
through December&nbsp;31, 2010 and reduce the Company&#146;s annual commitment in 2004
and 2005 to $35.0&nbsp;million from $45.0&nbsp;million. Beginning in 2006, the minimum
commitment would be reduced 5% annually. The Company expects to finalize this
agreement in the second quarter of 2004. If the Company does not execute the final agreement, the Company could
be obligated to make a payment to Convergys of 40% of the difference between
the commitment and actual amount of services purchased, or approximately $1.6
million in 2004 based on a projected shortfall of $4.0&nbsp;million.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Between October and December&nbsp;2002, five virtually identical class action

Executive Officers in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">These complaints were filed on behalf of purchasers of the Company&#146;s securities
between January&nbsp;17, 2001 and May&nbsp;20, 2002, inclusive, and alleged violations of
Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by, inter
alia, (1)&nbsp;improperly recognizing revenue associated with Indefeasible Right of
Use (&#147;IRU&#148;) agreements; and (2)&nbsp;failing to write-down goodwill associated with
the Company&#146;s 1999 acquisition of IXC Communications, Inc. The plaintiffs seek
unspecified compensatory damages, attorney&#146;s fees, and expert expenses.

consolidation of the complaints and appointment as lead plaintiff. By order
dated October&nbsp;29, 2003, Local 144 Nursing Home Pension Fund, Paul J. Brunner

number of new allegations. Cincinnati Bell Inc. was added as defendant in
this amended filing. The Company&#146;s motion to dismiss was filed on February&nbsp;6,

current and former directors on April&nbsp;9, 2003 alleging breaches of fiduciary
duty arising out of the same allegations discussed in In re Broadwing Inc.
Securities Class&nbsp;Action Lawsuits above. Pursuant to a stipulation between the
parties, defendants are not required, absent further order by the Court, to
answer, move, or otherwise respond to this complaint until 30
days after the federal court renders a ruling on defendants&#146; motion to dismiss
in In re Broadwing Inc. Securities Class&nbsp;Action Lawsuits. The timing and

Savings and Security Plan, the Broadwing Retirement Savings Plan, and a class
of participants in the Plans, generally allege that the defendants breached
their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (&#147;ERISA&#148;) by improperly encouraging the Plan participant-plaintiffs to
elect to invest in the Company stock fund within the relevant Plan and by
improperly continuing to make employer contributions to the Company stock fund
within the relevant Plan.

October&nbsp;22, 2003, a putative consolidated class action complaint was filed

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2000, BRCOM entered into a long-term construction contract to build a
fiber route system. During the second quarter of 2002, the customer
alleged a breach of contract and requested the Company to cease all
construction activities, requested a refund of $62.0&nbsp;million in progress
payments previously paid to the Company, and requested conveyance of title to
all routes constructed under the contract. Subsequently, the Company notified
the customer that such purported termination was improper and constituted a
material breach under the terms of the contract, causing the Company to
terminate the contract. As a result of the contract termination, the Company
expensed $13.3&nbsp;million in both costs incurred under the contract and estimated
shutdown costs during the second quarter of 2002. In February&nbsp;2004, the
Company and El Paso Global Networks reached a final settlement of the
arbitration proceeding. Under the terms of the settlement, both parties agreed
to release their respective claims for monetary damages. As a result of the
settlement, the Company recorded a $5.2&nbsp;million charge included in &#147;Asset
Impairments and Other Charges (Credits)&#148; in the Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the fourth quarter of 2003. The operating
expenses were related to the increase in obligations assumed, indemnities
granted and warranties provided under the terms of the settlement agreement
over what had been previously recorded.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">During the normal course of business, the Company makes certain indemnities,
commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in
relation to certain transactions. These include (a)&nbsp;intellectual property
indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sales and/or license
of products and services,(b) indemnities to customers in connection
with losses incurred while performing services on their premises (c)
indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company and (d)&nbsp;indemnities involving
the representations and warranties in certain contracts. In addition, the
Company has made contractual commitments to several employees providing for
payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of
these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on
the maximum potential for future payments that the Company could be obligated
to make. Except for amounts recorded in relation to insured losses, the
Company has not recorded a liability for these indemnities, commitments and
other guarantees in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, excepted as described
below.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company has indemnified the buyer of the broadband assets against certain
potential claims, including environmental, tax, title and authorization,
broker, and other general claims. The title and authorization indemnification
is capped at 100% of the purchase price of the broadband assets, which
initially was $91.5&nbsp;million, subject to reductions under the terms of the
purchase agreement. The environmental and general indemnifications are capped
at 50% of the purchase price of the broadband assets.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In order to determine the fair value of the indemnification obligations and
warranties provided to the buyer of the broadband assets, the Company performed
a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis, utilizing the minimum and
maximum potential claims and several scenarios within the range of
possibilities. The analysis resulted in a $7.8&nbsp;million estimated fair value of
the indemnification obligations, which is included in other liabilities and has
been reflected as a reduction of the gain on sale of broadband assets in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In February&nbsp;2004, the Company reached a final settlement with a customer
related to a disputed construction contract, discussed above. As a result of
the terms of the settlement, the Company recorded $3.2&nbsp;million related to
indemnities granted and warranties provided under the terms of the settlement
agreement.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as special purpose
entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;) or variable interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;), which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
arrangements or other limited purposes. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003 the Company is
not involved in any unconsolidated SPEs or VIEs.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Balance Sheet</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The following comparisons are December&nbsp;31, 2003 balances relative to December
31, 2002.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The change in cash and cash equivalents is explained in the preceding
discussion of capital investment, resources and liquidity or in the cash flow
discussion below. The decrease in accounts receivable of $99.6&nbsp;million was
primarily the result of $73.8&nbsp;million of BRCOM receivables sold in connection
with the broadband sale. The increase in total deferred income tax assets
of $692.5
million was primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance related to
uncertainties surrounding BRCOM&#146;s liquidity, which were substantially mitigated
in 2003. The increase of $30.9&nbsp;million in net property, plant and equipment
was primarily due to the adoption of SFAS 143 as accumulated depreciation of
$134.0&nbsp;million related to estimated removal cost in the Local segment was
reversed as a change in accounting principle and by capital expenditures of
$126.4&nbsp;million. This was partially offset by $49.0&nbsp;million of broadband assets
sold and depreciation expense of $169.1&nbsp;million. The increase in other
noncurrent assets related to an increase in deferred financing costs of $34.2
million, which was primarily the result of additional financing costs incurred
related to the issuance of the 16% notes (in March&nbsp;2003), the amendment to the
Company&#146;s credit facilities (in March&nbsp;2003), the issuance of the 7&#188;% Senior
notes due 2013 (in July&nbsp;2003) and the issuance of the 8 3/8% notes (in November
2003). These increases were partially offset by the decreases from the
write-off of previously deferred financing costs related to the reduction in
borrowings under the Company&#146;s credit facilities with the net proceeds from the
issuances of the 16% notes, the 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013 and the 8 3/8% notes.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The decrease in current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt of $190.4
million and $80.2&nbsp;million, respectively, were due to cash flow from operations,
the $82.7&nbsp;million pay down of debt utilizing the proceeds of the broadband
asset sale, the exchange of common stock for the BRCOM 9% notes and eliminating the capital lease of the Company&#146;s headquarters,
partially offset by paid in kind interest and amortization of discounts.
Accounts payable decreased $64.9&nbsp;million, or 50%, primarily due to $41.8
million of accounts payable assumed by the buyers of the broadband assets and
by timing of vendor payments. The decrease in current unearned revenue of
$77.4&nbsp;million was primarily due to $42.7&nbsp;million of liabilities assumed by the
buyers of the broadband assets and amortization of an IRU contract that expired
in May&nbsp;2003. The decrease in long-term unearned revenue, less current portion
of $294.1&nbsp;million was primarily due to $278.7&nbsp;million of liabilities assumed by
the buyers of the broadband assets.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The
decrease in dividends payable of $28.3&nbsp;million was due to the
exchange of common stock for
the BRCOM 12&#189;% Preferreds.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The decrease in minority interest of $404.2&nbsp;million was due to the exchange of
BRCOM&#146;s 12&#189;% Preferreds for common stock of the Company, partially offset
by an increase in minority interest in the earnings of the Wireless segment.

totaled $310.6&nbsp;million, $118.0&nbsp;million more than the $192.6&nbsp;million provided by

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">2002.
This increase is largely due to a reduction in cash used on
operations and working capital needs resulting from the sale of
substantially all of the broadband assets.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s investing activities included outflows for capital expenditures
and inflows from the sale of equity investments and assets. Capital
expenditures during 2003 totaled $126.4&nbsp;million, $49.5&nbsp;million lower than the
$175.9&nbsp;million incurred during 2002. The decrease is due to completion of the
optical overbuild of the national broadband network and subsequent sale of the
broadband assets, partially offset by an increase at CBW
related to the GSM/GPRS network overbuild previously discussed. In 2003, the
Company received $82.7&nbsp;million from the sale of substantially all of the assets
of its broadband business and $3.8&nbsp;million from the sale of its entire equity
investment in Terabeam, offset by $6.1&nbsp;million in fees related to the sale of
the BRCOM assets. In 2002, the Company received proceeds of $345.0&nbsp;million as
a result of the sale of substantially all of the assets of CBD and $23.3
million from the sale of its entire equity stake in Anthem Inc.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company received $1,390.0&nbsp;million of gross cash proceeds from the issuance
of the 16% notes, the 7&#188;% senior notes due 2013 and the 8 3/8% notes during
2003. These gross proceeds were used to pay amounts outstanding under the
credit facility, purchase the Convertible Subordinated Notes at a discounted
price equal to 97% of their accreted value, and pay fees and expenses related
to the transactions. The Company permanently prepaid $708.8&nbsp;million in
borrowings under its term and revolving credit facilities and made a $195.7
million payment under its term credit facilities with the net cash proceeds
from the 16% notes, the net cash proceeds from the 7&#188;% senior notes due
2013 and cash provided by operations. BCSI Inc., a subsidiary of BRCOM,
permanently repaid $193.0&nbsp;million of the revolving credit facility using cash
proceeds of $82.7&nbsp;million from the sale of broadband assets and borrowings from
the Company to fund operations and pay down remaining liabilities of $110.3
million in 2003. The Company reduced its borrowings under its revolving credit
facilities utilizing cash provided by operations and cash on its balance sheet
as of December&nbsp;31, 2002.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Approximately
$7.9&nbsp;million in 6&#190;% cumulative convertible preferred stock
dividends were paid during 2003. As a result of BRCOM&#146;s decision to defer the
February&nbsp;15, 2003, May&nbsp;15, 2003 and August&nbsp;15, 2003 cash dividend payment on
its 12&#189;% Preferreds, the Company conserved approximately $24.8&nbsp;million in
cash during 2003 compared to 2002. The dividends were accrued, and therefore
were presented as minority interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) through the exchange of the
preferred stock on September&nbsp;8, 2003. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of minority
interest. Debt issuance costs during 2003 totaled $80.4&nbsp;million, $71.2&nbsp;million
higher than the $9.2&nbsp;million incurred during 2002. The increase in debt
issuance costs is due to the financing transactions completed in 2003.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company held $26.0&nbsp;million in cash and cash
equivalents. In addition to cash on hand, the primary sources of cash will be
cash generated by operations and borrowings from the Company&#146;s revolving credit
facility. The primary uses of cash will be for funding the maintenance and
strategic expansion of the local and wireless networks; interest and principal
payments on the Company&#146;s credit facilities, 16% notes, 7&#188;% Senior notes
due 2013, 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2023, 8 3/8% notes<B>, </B>and CBT notes; dividends on
the 6&#190;% cumulative convertible preferred stock; working capital; and
liability management associated with BRCOM up to the maximum amount permitted
under the terms of the 16% notes, the 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013, 8 3/8% notes
and Credit Agreement.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In 2002, cash provided by operating activities totaled $192.6&nbsp;million, $66.9
million lower than the $259.5&nbsp;million generated during 2001, partially due to
an increase in working capital requirements and a reduction in cash flow from
CBD, which was sold in March&nbsp;2002.

and inflows from the sale of equity investments. Capital expenditures during
2002 totaled $175.9&nbsp;million, $472.6&nbsp;million lower than the $648.5&nbsp;million
incurred during 2001. The decrease is due to completion of the optical
overbuild of the national network, completion of the wireless network footprint
and installation of DSL-enabling equipment at CBT. In 2002, the Company
received proceeds of $345.0&nbsp;million as a result of the sale of substantially
all of the assets of CBD and $23.3&nbsp;million from the sale of its entire equity
stake in Anthem Inc.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Preferred stock dividends of $10.4&nbsp;million and $24.8&nbsp;million were paid to the
Cincinnati Bell Inc. 6&#190;% preferred shareowners and BRCOM&#146;s 12&#189;% preferred shareowners, respectively, during 2002. As a result of BRCOM&#146;s decision
to defer the August&nbsp;15, 2002 and November&nbsp;15, 2002 cash dividend payments on
its 12&#189;% preferred stock, the Company conserved $24.8&nbsp;million in cash during the second
half of 2002. The dividends were accrued, and therefore continued to be
presented as minority interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). In addition, the Company repaid a
net $298.9&nbsp;million of its credit facility during 2002, using the proceeds from
the sale of substantially all of the assets of CBD, as discussed above,
partially offset by additional borrowings. Refer to Notes 8 and 10 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of debt
and minority interest, respectively.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Regulatory Matters and Competitive Trends</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Federal &#151; </B>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the &#147;1996 Act&#148;), including the
rules subsequently adopted by the FCC to implement the 1996 Act, can be
expected to impact CBT&#146;s in-territory local exchange operations in the form of
greater competition. The FCC&#146;s rules have changed from time to time as a
result of judicial review and further actions by the FCC and are expected to
continue to change in the future. These changes can be expected to affect both
CBT&#146;s in-territory local exchange operations and its out of territory
operations.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>State &#151; </B>At the state level, CBT conducts local exchange operations in portions
of Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana and, consequently, is subject to regulation by
the Public Utilities Commissions (&#147;PUC&#148;) in those states. In Ohio, the PUC has
concluded a proceeding to establish permanent rates that CBT can charge to
competitive local exchange carriers for unbundled network elements, although
some elements will remain subject to interim rates indefinitely. The Kentucky
commission has authorized CBT to use the same rates established by the Ohio PUC
for unbundled network elements in Kentucky. The establishment of these rates
is intended to facilitate market entry by competitive local exchange carriers.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Ohio PUC has required SBC Communications Inc. (&#147;SBC&#148;) and Verizon
Communications Inc. (&#147;Verizon&#148;) to offer competitive local exchange services in
several Ohio markets, including the Cincinnati market, as a condition to the
approval of their respective mergers involving Ameritech Corp. and GTE Corp.
Both SBC and Verizon have entered into interconnection agreements with CBT.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">CBT is currently subject to an Alternative Regulation&nbsp;Plan (&#147;Alt Reg Plan&#148;) in
Ohio. The current Alt Reg Plan gives CBT pricing flexibility in several
competitive service categories in exchange for CBT&#146;s commitment to freeze
certain basic residential service rates during the term of the Alt Reg Plan.
The term of the current Alt Reg Plan will remain in effect through June&nbsp;30,
2004. Prior to June&nbsp;30, 2004, CBT will be required to seek an extension of its
existing Plan, initiate a proceeding to establish a new Alt Reg Plan or adopt a
generic Alt Reg Plan developed by the Ohio PUC.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Recently Issued Accounting Standards</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued FASB
Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, &#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No.&nbsp;51&#148; (&#147;FIN 46&#148;). In December&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued
FIN 46-R &#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB
No.&nbsp;51&#148; (&#147;FIN 46-R&#148;) (revised December&nbsp;2003), which replaces FIN 46. FIN 46-R
incorporates certain modifications to FIN 46 adopted by the FASB subsequent to
the issuance of FIN 46, including modifications to the scope of FIN 46.
Additionally, FIN 46-R also incorporates much of the guidance previously issued
in the form of FASB Staff Positions. For all special purposes entities
(&#147;SPEs&#148;) and variable interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;) created prior to February&nbsp;1,
2003, public entities must apply either the provisions of FIN 46, or early
adoption of the provisions of FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or
annual reporting period after December&nbsp;15, 2003. The Company has evaluated the
provisions of this interpretation and has determined that the interpretation
has no impact on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows as it has no SPEs or VIEs.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
149, &#147;Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 149&#148;). This Statement amends and clarifies financial
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as
&#147;derivatives&#148;) and for hedging activities under Statement No.&nbsp;133, &#147;Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.&#148; SFAS 149 did not have an
impact on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
150, &#147;Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity&#148; (&#147;SFAS 150&#148;). This Statement establishes standards for
how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer
classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an
asset in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously
classified as equity. SFAS 150 was effective for financial instruments entered
into or modified after May&nbsp;31, 2003, and otherwise was effective at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2003. The
adoption of SFAS 150 had no impact on the Company&#146;s financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.&nbsp;132 (revised 2003), &#147;Employers&#146; Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits&#148; (&#147;SFAS 132&#148;). This Statement revises employers&#146;
disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The
Company revised its disclosures, which are included in Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, as required by the standard.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (&#147;FSP&#148;) No.&nbsp;106-1,
&#147;Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003&#148; (&#147;FSP 106-1&#148;). FSP 106-1
permits employers that sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide
prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one-time election to defer
accounting for any effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the &#147;Act&#148;). The Company has elected to defer the
accounting effects of the Act until the FASB issues guidance on how to account
for the federal subsidy.
The Company expects the Act will reduce its annual non-cash postretirement
health expense by approximately $1&nbsp;million and reduce its postretirement health
liability by up to $12&nbsp;million, assuming no plan design changes.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104 (&#147;SAB 104&#148;), Revenue Recognition, which supercedes
SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104&#146;s primary
purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to
multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of the issuance
of EITF 00-21, &#147;Accounting for Revenue

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations. To manage
its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Company uses a combination of
variable rate short-term and fixed rate long-term financial instruments. The
Company has historically employed derivative financial instruments to manage
its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Company does not hold or
issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or enter into
interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company was required by terms of its credit facility to engage in interest
rate swaps once certain thresholds were exceeded with regard to floating rate
debt as a percentage of the Company&#146;s total debt. The Company exceeded this
threshold during 2000 and, accordingly, entered into a series of interest rate
swap agreements on notional amounts totaling $130&nbsp;million. The Company
continued to exceed the above noted threshold in 2001 and increased the
notional amount to $490&nbsp;million. Throughout 2003, these agreements expired.
The purpose of these agreements was to hedge against changes in market interest
rates to be charged on the Company&#146;s borrowings under its credit facility. The
March&nbsp;2003 credit facility amendment and restatement eliminated the requirement
to maintain a certain threshold of fixed rate debt as a percentage of the
Company&#146;s total debt.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest
payments and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts
between the parties. Because the notional amounts are not exchanged, the
notional amounts of these agreements are not indicative of the Company&#146;s
exposure resulting from these derivatives. The amounts to be exchanged between
the parties are primarily the result of the swap&#146;s notional amount and the
fixed and floating rate percentages to be charged on the swap. In accordance
with SFAS 133, interest rate differentials associated with the Company&#146;s
interest rate swaps are recorded as an adjustment to interest payable or
receivable with the offset to interest expense over the life of the swap. The
Company&#146;s interest rate swap agreements expired throughout 2003. During 2003,
the fair value of the interest rate swaps increased resulting in a
year-to-date, after-tax net gain of $4.5&nbsp;million, which was recognized in Other
Comprehensive Income (Loss).


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Potential nonperformance by counterparties to the swap agreements exposes the
Company to a certain amount of credit risk due to the possibility of
counterparty default. Because the Company&#146;s only counterparties in these
transactions are financial institutions that are at least investment grade, it
believes the risk of counterparty default is minimal.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Interest Rate Risk Management &#150; The Company&#146;s objective in managing its
exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate
changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The management of Cincinnati Bell Inc. is responsible for the information and
representations contained in this report. Management believes that the
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that the
other information in this report is consistent with those statements. In
preparing the financial statements, management is required to include amounts
based on estimates and judgments that it believes are reasonable under the
circumstances.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial statements,
management maintains a system of internal accounting controls, which is
continually reviewed and evaluated. Our internal auditors monitor compliance
with the system of internal controls in connection with their program of
internal audits. However, there are inherent limitations that should be
recognized in considering the assurances provided by any system of internal
accounting controls. Management believes that its system provides reasonable
assurance that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly
recorded and executed in accordance with management&#146;s authorization, that the
recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals, and that appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. Management also seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of
its financial data by the careful selection of its managers, by organization
arrangements that provide an appropriate division of responsibility, and by
communications programs aimed at assuring that its policies, standards and
managerial authorities are understood throughout the organization.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
independent auditors. Their audit was conducted in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit and
Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed of five
directors who are not employees, meets periodically with management, the
internal auditors and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to review their performance
and responsibilities and to discuss auditing, internal accounting controls and
financial reporting matters. Both the internal auditors and the independent
auditors periodically meet alone with the Audit and Finance Committee and have
access to the Audit and Finance Committee at any time.

Shareowners of Cincinnati Bell Inc.</I>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Cincinnati Bell Inc. (f/k/a Broadwing Inc.) (&#147;the Company&#148;) and its
subsidiaries at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
has restated its consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2002 and its
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), cash
flows, and shareowners&#146; equity (deficit)&nbsp;for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2002
and 2001 to reflect adjustments relating to a long-term construction contract
entered into in 2000.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on January&nbsp;1,
2003, the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement
obligations in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;143. In addition, as discussed in Note 5 to the
consolidated financial statements, on January&nbsp;1, 2002, the Company changed the
manner in which it accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets upon
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;142.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Description of Business &#151; </B>Cincinnati Bell Inc. (&#147;the Company&#148;), f/k/a Broadwing
Inc., provides diversified telecommunications services through businesses in
four segments: Local, Wireless, Other and Broadband. During the first quarter
of 2002, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of Cincinnati Bell
Directory (&#147;CBD&#148;), which was previously reported in the Other segment. During
the second and third quarter of 2003, the Company sold substantially all of the
assets of the broadband business, which is reported in the Broadband segment.
These assets were held by the Company&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, BRCOM (f/k/a
Broadwing Communications Inc.). Refer to Note 3 for a detailed discussion of
the sale.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company&#146;s primary business consisted of the Local
and Wireless segment. The only remaining BRCOM subsidiaries with operating
assets were Cincinnati Bell Technology Solutions Inc. (&#147;CBTS&#148;), an information
technology consulting, data collocation and managed services subsidiary, and
Cincinnati Bell Any Distance (&#147;CBAD&#148;), a subsidiary whose assets service the
Other segment&#146;s long distance business. In addition to CBAD, the Other segment
also includes Cincinnati Bell Public Communications Inc. (&#147;Public&#148;), a public
payphone service provider.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Basis of Presentation &#151; </B>The consolidated financial statements of the Company
have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the current classifications. As discussed in Note 2, the prior year financial
statements have been restated to reflect adjustments related to a long-term
construction contract entered into in 2000.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Basis of Consolidation &#151; </B>The consolidated financial statements include the
consolidated accounts of Cincinnati Bell Inc. and its majority-owned
subsidiaries over which it exercises control. Significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
statements.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Use of Estimates &#151; </B>Preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Cash Equivalents &#151; </B>Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Restricted Cash &#151; </B>In 2002, restricted cash consisted of cash equivalents held
in escrow related to the 16% subordinated discount notes, which restrictions
were released upon funding of those notes in March 2003.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Unbilled Receivables &#151; </B>Unbilled receivables arise from services rendered but
not yet billed. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, unbilled receivables, net of
allowances, totaled $23.4&nbsp;million and $40.4&nbsp;million, respectively.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable &#150; </B>The Company establishes the
allowances for uncollectible accounts using both percentages of aged accounts
receivable balances to reflect the historical average of credit losses and
specific provisions for certain large, potentially uncollectible balances. The
Company believes that its allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate
based on the methods described above. However, if one or more of the Company&#146;s
larger customers were to default on its accounts receivable

general economic conditions in the Company&#146;s markets deteriorated, the Company
could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions
established.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Materials and Supplies &#151; </B>Materials and supplies consist of wireless handsets,
wireline network components and other materials and supplies, which are carried
at the lower of average cost or market.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Property, Plant and Equipment &#151; </B>As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had
property, plant and equipment with a net carrying value of $898.8&nbsp;million.
The gross value of property, plant and equipment is stated at cost
net of asset impairments. The Company&#146;s provision for
depreciation of telephone plant is determined on a straight-line basis using
the whole life and remaining life methods. Provision for depreciation of other
property is based on the straight-line method over the estimated economic
useful life. Repairs and maintenance expense items are charged to expense as
incurred. Beginning in 2003, in connection with the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;143, &#147;Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations&#148; (&#147;SFAS 143&#148;) (discussed below), the cost of removal for telephone
plant was included in costs of products and services as incurred.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company revised the estimated economic
useful life of its wireless TDMA network due to the implementation of and
expected migration to its GSM/GPRS network. The Company shortened its estimate
of the economic useful life of its TDMA network to December&nbsp;31, 2006. The
Wireless segment recorded additional depreciation expense of $5.2&nbsp;million to
reflect the acceleration of depreciation for the TDMA network. In 2003, the
change in estimate reduced operating income and net income by
$5.2&nbsp;million and $3.4&nbsp;million, respectively. In 2003, basic and diluted
earnings per share were decreased by $0.02 and $0.01, respectively, as a result of this change in
estimate.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets &#151; </B>Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price consideration over the fair value of assets
acquired recorded in connection with purchase business combinations.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of Federal Communications
Commission (&#147;FCC&#148;) licenses for spectrum of the Wireless segment. The Company
determined its wireless licenses met the definition of indefinite-lived
intangible assets under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;142,
&#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets&#148; (&#147;SFAS 142&#148;) as the Company believes the
need for wireless spectrum will continue independently of technology and the
Company may renew the wireless licenses in a routine manner every ten years for
a nominal fee, provided the Company continues to meet the service and
geographic coverage provisions required by the FCC. Upon the adoption of SFAS
142 on January&nbsp;1, 2002, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of
$2,008.7&nbsp;million, net of tax, as a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle, related to the Broadband segment and ceased amortization of
remaining goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as discussed in Note
5.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Pursuant to SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets not subject to
amortization are tested for impairment annually, or when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. For goodwill, a
two-step impairment test is performed. The first step compares the fair value
of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the
carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of
the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The
second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with
the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value is determined by
allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and
liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a
business combination. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over
the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of
goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is in excess
of the implied fair value of that goodwill, then an impairment loss is
recognized equal to that excess. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the
impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible
asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived
asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
equal to that excess.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In 2001, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful
lives of 30 to 40&nbsp;years, with the vast majority being amortized over 30&nbsp;years.
Indefinite lived intangible assets were amortized on a straight-line basis over
estimated useful lives of 2 to 40&nbsp;years.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Other than Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived
Intangibles </B>&#150; The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets,
other than goodwill and indefinite-lived assets discussed above, when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future
undiscounted cash
flows expected to result from the use of an asset (or group of assets) and its
eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. An impairment loss is
measured as the amount by which the asset&#146;s carrying value exceeds its fair
value.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company performed an impairment
assessment of its Broadband segment&#146;s long-lived assets as a result of the
restructuring plan implemented during the quarter and the strategic
alternatives being explored, including the potential sale of the Broadband
business. This assessment considered all of the contemplated strategic
alternatives for the Broadband segment, including a potential sale of assets,
using a probability-weighted approach. Based on this assessment, the Company
determined that the long-lived assets of the Broadband segment were impaired
and recorded a $2,200.0&nbsp;million non-cash impairment charge to reduce the
carrying value of these assets. Of the total charge, $1,901.7&nbsp;million related
to tangible fixed assets and $298.3&nbsp;million related to finite-lived intangible
assets.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company recorded a $3.4&nbsp;million asset impairment in the fourth quarter of
2003 to write-down the value of its public payphone assets to fair value. The
Company calculated the fair value of the assets utilizing a discounted cash
flow analysis based on the best estimate of projected cash flows from the
underlying assets.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Other Intangible Assets &#151; </B>Intangible assets subject to amortization expense
consist primarily of roaming and trade name agreements acquired by the Wireless
segment. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 40&nbsp;years.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Deferred Financing Costs&#151; </B>Deferred financing costs are costs incurred in
connection with obtaining long-term financing. These costs are amortized as
interest expense over the terms of the related debt agreements. As of December
31, 2003 and 2002, deferred financing costs totaled $53.5&nbsp;million and $19.3
million, respectively. The related expense, included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) under the caption
&#147;Interest expense and other financing costs&#148;, amounted to $33.7&nbsp;million, $14.6
million and $6.7&nbsp;million during the years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively<B>.</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Asset Retirement Obligations &#151; </B>The Company adopted SFAS 143 as of January&nbsp;1,
2003. This statement requires entities to record the fair value of a legal
liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period it is incurred. The
removal cost is initially capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life
of the underlying asset. The associated liability is accreted over the life of
the underlying asset. Once the obligation is ultimately settled, any
difference between the final cost and the recorded liability is recognized as
income or loss on disposition. The Company determined the Local segment did
not have a liability under SFAS 143, while the Wireless segment and Other
segment did have a liability. The Company recorded a non-recurring increase to
net income as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as of
January&nbsp;1, 2003 of $85.9&nbsp;million, net of tax. The Local segment recorded $86.3
million of income related to depreciation previously recorded for asset removal
costs, offset by $0.4&nbsp;million of expense recorded in the Wireless segment.
Additionally, the Company recorded a liability for removal costs at fair value
of approximately $2.6&nbsp;million and an asset of approximately $2.3&nbsp;million in the
first quarter of 2003 related to the Wireless and Other segments. The adoption
of SFAS 143 had an immaterial pro forma impact on net income for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the
Wireless segment recorded an additional retirement obligation of $1.9&nbsp;million
due to a change in estimate related to the probability assumption used in

does not exercise significant influence are reported at fair value in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;115,
&#147;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities&#148; (&#147;SFAS
115&#148;). These investments are recorded at cost based on specific
identification. The Company reviews its investments for impairment whenever
the fair value of the individual investment is less than its cost basis. An
impairment loss is recognized if the decline in fair value is deemed to be
&#147;other than temporary.&#148; The Company uses the average cost basis to determine
the gain or loss on an investment transaction. Additionally, the Company
invests in certain equity investments, which do not have readily determinable
fair market values. These investments are recorded at cost and are evaluated
for impairment as warranted by specific facts and circumstances. The Company
had no investments in publicly traded companies as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and
2002.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue Recognition &#150; </B>The Company recognizes revenue as services are provided.
Local access fees are billed monthly, in advance,
while revenue is recognized as the services are provided. Postpaid
wireless, switched voice and data and Internet product services are billed
monthly in arrears, while the revenue is recognized as the services are
provided. Equipment revenue is generally recognized upon performance
of contractual obligations, such as shipment, delivery, installation or
customer acceptance. Cincinnati Bell Telephone&#146;s (&#147;CBT&#148;) upfront fees for
customer connection and activation are deferred and amortized into revenue on a
straight-line basis over the average customer life. The related connection and
activation costs, to the extent of the upfront fees, are deferred and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the average customer life. Subsequent to July&nbsp;1,
2003 and in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) Issue
00-21, &#147;Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables"(&#147;EITF
00-21&#148;), Cincinnati Bell Wireless LLC (&#147;CBW&#148;) ceased deferral of revenue and
cost related to customer connections and activations. As CBW does not require
customer contracts and sells its services at fair market value, the activation
revenue is allocated to and recorded upon the sale of the wireless handset.
This change did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Prior to the sale of the broadband assets in the second and third quarter of
2003 (refer to Note 3), broadband transport services were billed monthly, in
advance, while revenue was recognized as the services were provided. In
addition, the Company had previously entered into indefeasible right-of-use
(&#147;IRU&#148;) agreements, which represent the lease of network
capacity or dark fiber, recording
unearned revenue at the earlier of the acceptance of the
applicable portion of the network by the customer or the receipt of cash. The
buyer of IRU services typically paid cash or other consideration upon execution
of the
contract, and the associated IRU revenue was recognized over the life of the
agreement as services were provided, beginning on the date of customer
acceptance. In the event the buyer of an IRU terminated a contract prior to
the contract expiration and released the Company from the obligation to provide
future services, the remaining unamortized unearned revenue was recognized in
the period in which the contract was terminated. The Company generated $59.4

2001, respectively. Concurrent with the broadband asset sale, all of the
remaining IRU obligations were assumed by the buyer.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Pricing of local services is generally subject to oversight by both state and
federal regulatory commissions. Such regulation also covers services,
competition and other public policy issues. Various regulatory rulings and
interpretations could result in adjustments to revenue in future periods. The
Company monitors these proceedings closely and adjusts revenue accordingly.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Construction revenue and estimated profits were recognized according to the
percentage of completion method on a cost incurred to total costs estimated at
completion basis. The method was used because the Company could make
reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs applicable to various
stages of a contract. As the financial reporting of these contracts depended
on estimates that were continually assessed throughout the terms of the
contracts, revenue recognized was subject to revision as the contracts neared
completion. Revisions in estimates were reflected in the period in which the
facts that gave rise to the revision became known and impacted revenue and
costs of services and products. Construction projects were considered
substantially complete upon customer acceptance. In November&nbsp;2001, the Company
announced its intention to exit the construction business upon completion of
one remaining contract. That contract was terminated in 2002 and a final
settlement to resolve certain disputes was reached in February&nbsp;2004 as
discussed in Note 11.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Advertising &#151; </B>Costs related to advertising are expensed as incurred and
amounted to $21&nbsp;million, $14&nbsp;million and $39&nbsp;million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Legal Expenses &#151; </B>Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are
expensed as incurred.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Fiber Exchange Agreements &#151; </B>In connection with the development of its optical
network, the Company&#146;s Broadband segment entered into various agreements to
exchange fiber usage rights. The Company accounted for agreements with other
carriers to either exchange fiber asset service contracts for capacity or
services based on the carrying value of the assets exchanged. Concurrent with
the broadband asset sale in 2003, all remaining fiber exchange agreements were
assumed by the buyer (Refer to Note 3 for a detailed discussion of the sale).


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Income Taxes &#151; </B>The income tax provision consists of an amount for taxes
currently payable and an expense (or benefit) for tax consequences deferred to
future periods. Deferred investment tax credits are being amortized as a
reduction of the provision for income taxes over the estimated useful lives of
the related property, plant and equipment. The ultimate realization of the
deferred income tax assets depends upon the Company&#146;s ability to generate
future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other
deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of its net operating
loss carryforwards.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Stock-Based Compensation &#151; </B>The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles
Board (&#147;APB&#148;) Opinion No.&nbsp;25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees&#148; (&#147;APB
25&#148;), and related interpretations. Compensation cost is measured under the
intrinsic value method. Stock-based employee compensation cost is not
reflected in net income (loss), as all options granted under these plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant. If the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123, &#147;Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation&#148; (&#147;SFAS 123&#148;), the
expense, net of tax, that would have been
recognized totaled $35.4&nbsp;million, $30.1&nbsp;million and $24.4&nbsp;million in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. The following table illustrates the effect on net
income (loss)&nbsp;and basic and diluted earnings (loss)&nbsp;per share if the Company
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, to stock-based
employee compensation in all periods presented.

Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;46,
&#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No.&nbsp;51&#148;
(&#147;FIN 46&#148;). In December&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued FIN 46-R &#147;Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No.&nbsp;51&#148; (&#147;FIN 46-R&#148;)
(revised December&nbsp;2003), which replaces FIN 46. FIN 46-R incorporates certain
modifications to FIN 46 adopted by the FASB subsequent to the issuance of FIN
46, including modifications to the scope of FIN 46. Additionally, FIN 46-R
also incorporates much of the guidance previously issued in the form of FASB
Staff Positions. For all special purposes entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;) and variable
interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;) created prior to February&nbsp;1, 2003, public entities
must apply either the provisions of FIN 46, or early adoption of the provisions
of FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period after
December&nbsp;15, 2003. The Company has evaluated the provisions of this
interpretation and has determined that the interpretation has no impact on the
Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as it has no
SPEs or VIEs.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
149, &#147;Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities&#148; (&#147;SFAS 149&#148;). This Statement amends and clarifies financial
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as
&#147;derivatives&#148;) and for hedging
activities under Statement No.&nbsp;133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.&#148; SFAS 149 did not have an impact on the Company&#146;s
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
150, &#147;Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity&#148; (&#147;SFAS 150&#148;). This Statement establishes standards for
how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer
classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an
asset in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously
classified as equity. SFAS 150 was effective for financial instruments entered
into or modified after May&nbsp;31, 2003, and otherwise

beginning of the first interim period beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2003. The
adoption of SFAS 150 had no impact on the Company&#146;s financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.&nbsp;132 (revised 2003), &#147;Employers&#146; Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits&#148; (&#147;SFAS 132&#148;). This Statement revises employers&#146;
disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The
Company revised its disclosures, which are included in Note 15, as required by
the standard.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In January&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (&#147;FSP&#148;) No.&nbsp;106-1,
&#147;Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003&#148; (&#147;FSP 106-1&#148;). FSP 106-1
permits employers that sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide
prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one-time election to defer
accounting for any effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the &#147;Act&#148;). The Company has
elected to defer the accounting effects of the Act until the FASB issues
guidance on how to account for the federal subsidy.
The Company expects the Act will reduce its annual non-cash postretirement
health expense by approximately $1&nbsp;million and reduce its postretirement health
liability by up to $12&nbsp;million, assuming no plan design changes.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;104 (&#147;SAB 104&#148;), Revenue Recognition, which supercedes
SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104&#146;s primary
purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to
multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of the issuance
of EITF 00-21, &#147;Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.&#148; SAB 104 did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In March&nbsp;2003, the EITF reached consensus on EITF 00-21. This guidance
addresses the determination of whether an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting. EITF 00-21 was
effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning
after June&nbsp;15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a material impact
on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Audit Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors recently completed an
investigation into the allegations contained in an amended class action
securities lawsuit filed in December&nbsp;2003. These allegations relate primarily
to the manner in which the Company recognized revenue, and wrote down assets,
with respect to its former broadband business. In connection with that
investigation, adjustments have been identified related to the manner that the
Company recorded a particular broadband network construction agreement entered
into in 2000. These adjustments related to the timing of revenue recognition
resulting from the inappropriate inclusion of certain costs that had not been
fully incurred and use of estimates regarding the extent to which the
construction contract had been completed. The Company has restated its
financial statements to reflect the revised accounting for this contract.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s restatement includes the reversal of a related unbilled account
receivable of $50.5 million that was previously written off in the second quarter of 2003, as
the account receivable was eliminated as a result of the adjustments to revenue
in 2001 and 2000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>3. Sale of Broadband Assets</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On February&nbsp;22, 2003, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell
substantially all of its broadband assets. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets&#148; (&#147;SFAS 144&#148;), the Company ceased depreciation of
the assets to be sold upon entering into the definitive agreement. On June&nbsp;6,
2003 and June&nbsp;13, 2003, the purchase agreement was amended to, among other
things, reduce the initial purchase price to $108.7&nbsp;million (an estimated

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">$91.5&nbsp;million in cash and $17.2&nbsp;million preliminary working capital promissory
note, which was ultimately reduced to zero based on the final working capital
position of the broadband business).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On June&nbsp;13, 2003, the first (and most significant) stage closing was
consummated. At the first stage closing, the Company had received regulatory
approval in states where approximately 75% of 2002 broadband revenue was
generated and effectively transferred control of the broadband business to the
buyer. The buyer paid the initial cash purchase price of $91.5&nbsp;million, of which $29.3
million was placed into escrow to support certain potential purchase price
adjustments and the portion of the purchase price payable upon the consummation
of the second and third stage closings.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During the third quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2003, the second and third (final)
stage closings were consummated as all remaining regulatory approvals had been
received. In connection with these closings, the Company received $20.5
million of the $29.3&nbsp;million escrowed funds. Subsequently, the Company
released the remaining escrowed funds of $8.8&nbsp;million to the buyer and returned
$0.5&nbsp;million of the purchase price in satisfaction of the working capital and
other post closing purchase price adjustments pursuant to the purchase
agreement between the Company and the buyer to settle such amounts.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company recorded a gain on sale of broadband assets of $336.7&nbsp;million
during 2003. The following table summarizes the components of the gain
(dollars in millions):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The adjustment to income tax reserves primarily relates to certain liabilities
recorded in connection with the purchase of the broadband business in 1999 and
are no longer considered necessary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the purchase agreement, the Company agreed to deliver a
parent guaranty in favor of the buyers, guaranteeing (1)&nbsp;all payments required
to be made by the BRCOM selling subsidiaries under the purchase agreement and
(2)&nbsp;the performance and observance and compliance with all covenants,
agreements,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">obligations, liabilities, representations and warranties of the BRCOM selling
subsidiaries under the purchase agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has indemnified the buyer of the broadband business against certain
potential claims. In order to determine the fair value of the indemnification
obligation, the Company performed a probability-weighted discounted cash flow
analysis, utilizing the minimum and maximum potential claims and several
scenarios within the range of possibilities. Such analysis resulted in an
estimated fair value of the indemnification obligation of $7.8&nbsp;million, which
is included in other liabilities and has been reflected as a reduction of the
gain on sale of broadband assets in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2003 (refer to Note&nbsp;11).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Not more than 30&nbsp;days after July&nbsp;1, 2004, the buyer will provide the BRCOM
selling subsidiaries with a calculation of cash EBITDA (as defined in the
Purchase Agreement) minus capital expenditures for the broadband business for
the period from July&nbsp;1, 2003 to July&nbsp;1, 2004. If annual cash EBITDA minus
capital expenditures for such period is negative $48&nbsp;million or less, the BRCOM
selling subsidiaries will pay to the buyers an amount equal to 35% of the
difference between negative $48&nbsp;million and the amount of annual cash EBITDA
minus capital expenditures, provided that the obligation for such reimbursement
will not exceed $10&nbsp;million. The Company has recorded a $10&nbsp;million liability
related to this potential purchase price adjustment. The BRCOM selling
subsidiaries will have no obligation to make the foregoing payment if the
buyers sell 51% or more of the equity, or voting control of the acquiring
entity, or the assets acquired in the broadband sale.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition, the Company entered into agreements with the buyer whereby the
Company will continue to market the buyer&#146;s broadband products to business
customers and to purchase capacity on the national network in order to sell
long distance services under the CBAD brand to residential and business
customers in the Greater Cincinnati area market. Due to the ongoing cash flows
under these arrangements, the sale of substantially all the broadband assets
did not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation under
SFAS 144.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>4. Senior Executive Bonuses and Termination Benefits</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $11.2&nbsp;million related to four
senior executives for certain success-based incentives and termination benefits
in accordance with their employment contracts, including all of the benefits
related to its former Chief Executive Officer who resigned effective July&nbsp;31,
2003. Substantially all of these benefits were paid upon termination. The
charge was required as the success plan, as defined in the senior executive
employment agreements, was completed upon the first stage closing of the sale
of substantially all of the broadband assets on June&nbsp;13, 2003. Three of the
senior executives, excluding the former Chief Executive Officer, were required
to remain with the Company for 180&nbsp;days following the completion of the success
plan. The charge included $0.8&nbsp;million of non-cash expenses related to the
accelerated vesting of stock options.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As previously discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted SFAS 142 on January&nbsp;1,
2002. The Company completed the initial impairment test for its Wireless and
Broadband segments during the first quarter of 2002, which indicated that the
goodwill of its Broadband segment was impaired as of January&nbsp;1, 2002 and
recorded an impairment charge of $2,008.7&nbsp;million, net of taxes, effective as
of January&nbsp;1, 2002. The impairment charge is reflected as a cumulative effect
of change in accounting principle, net of taxes, in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). As of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and
December&nbsp;31, 2002, goodwill totaled $40.9&nbsp;million, of which $40.1 related to
the Wireless segment and the remaining $0.8&nbsp;million related to the Other
segment.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>November&nbsp;2001 Restructuring Plan</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In November&nbsp;2001, the Company adopted a restructuring plan which included
initiatives to consolidate data centers, reduce the Company&#146;s expense
structure, exit the network construction business, eliminate other nonstrategic
operations and merge the digital subscriber line (&#147;DSL&#148;) and certain dial-up
Internet operations into the Company&#146;s other operations. Total restructuring
and impairment costs of $232.3&nbsp;million were recorded in 2001 related to these
initiatives. The $232.3&nbsp;million consisted of restructuring liabilities in the
amount of $84.2&nbsp;million and related non-cash asset impairments in the amount of
$148.1&nbsp;million. The restructuring charge was comprised of $21.4&nbsp;million
related to involuntary employee separation benefits, $62.5&nbsp;million related to
lease and other contractual terminations and $0.3&nbsp;million relating to other
exit costs.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During the first quarter of 2002, the Company
recorded additional restructuring
charges of $16.5&nbsp;million resulting from employee separation
benefits of $1.0
million and costs to terminate contractual obligations of $15.5&nbsp;million, which
were actions contemplated in the original plan for which an amount could not be
reasonably estimated at that time. During the fourth quarter of 2002, a $1.0
million reversal was made to the
restructuring reserve due to a change in estimate related to the termination of
contractual obligations. During the third quarter of 2003, a $1.2&nbsp;million
reversal was made to the restructuring reserve to reduce contractual
obligations as a result of the sale of the broadband business and was recorded
as a component of the gain on sale of broadband assets. During the fourth
quarter of 2003, a $4.1&nbsp;million reversal was made to the restructuring reserve
due to the settlement of certain obligations and a change in estimate related
to the termination of contractual obligations. In total, the Company expects
this restructuring plan to result in cash outlays of $89.4&nbsp;million and non-cash
items of $153.1&nbsp;million. The Company completed the plan as of December&nbsp;31,
2002, except for certain lease obligations, which are expected to continue
through December&nbsp;31, 2015.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The restructuring costs include the cost of involuntary employee separation
benefits, including severance, medical and other benefits, related to 863
employees across all areas of the Company. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002, all
employee separations had been completed which utilized reserves of $22.4
million, $17.6&nbsp;million of which was paid in cash. Cash
expenditures for termination of contractual obligations in
2003 amounted to $13.0&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the restructuring plan, the Company performed a review of
its long-lived assets to identify any potential impairments in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.&nbsp;121, &#147;Accounting for Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of&#148; (&#147;SFAS 121&#148;).
As a result, the Company recorded a $148.1&nbsp;million asset
impairment charge related
to the closing of data centers, consolidation of office space and curtailment
of other Company operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">centralized &#147;Cincinnati Bell&#148; presence for its customers. Total restructuring
costs of $9.4&nbsp;million were recorded in the first quarter of 2001 and consisted
of $2.5&nbsp;million related to lease terminations and $6.9&nbsp;million related to
involuntary employee separation benefits (including severance, medical
insurance and other benefits) for 114 employees. Of the total charge, $0.4
million in contractual terminations were related to CBD, which is presented as
a discontinued operation. During 2002, a $2.1&nbsp;million reversal was made to the
restructuring reserve due to an expected lease termination that did not occur.
In total, this restructuring plan resulted in cash outlays
of $6.4&nbsp;million and non-cash items of $0.9&nbsp;million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002,
this restructuring was complete.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>1999 Restructuring Plan</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In December&nbsp;1999, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to integrate
operations of the Company and BRCOM, (f/k/a/ IXC Communications)
acquired in November 1999, improve service delivery, and reduce the
Company&#146;s expense structure. Total restructuring costs and asset impairments
of $18.6&nbsp;million were recorded in 1999 related to these initiatives. The $18.6
million consisted of $7.7&nbsp;million relating to BRCOM (recorded as a component of
the purchase price allocation) and $10.9&nbsp;million relating to the Company
(recorded as a cost of operations). The $10.9&nbsp;million relating to the Company
consisted of restructuring and other liabilities in the amount of $9.5&nbsp;million
and related asset impairments of $1.4&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The restructuring costs recorded in 1999 included the costs of involuntary
employee separation benefits related to 347 employees (263 BRCOM employees and
84 employees from other subsidiaries of the Company). As of March&nbsp;31, 2001,
all employee separations had been completed for a total cash expenditure of
$9.1&nbsp;million. Employee separation benefits included severance, medical and
other benefits, and primarily affected customer support, infrastructure, and
the Company&#146;s long distance operations. The restructuring plans also included
costs associated with the closure of a variety of technical and customer
support facilities, the decommissioning of certain switching equipment, and the
termination of contracts with vendors.

separations and $0.2&nbsp;million in additional exist costs. The adjustment of $0.1
million in 2001 is related to additional severance in excess of the initial
estimate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Total cash expenditures during 2002 amounted to $0.8&nbsp;million. These
restructuring activities were completed in the third quarter of
2002, and the remaining reserve of $0.5&nbsp;million related to facility closure
costs was reversed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>7. Investments</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Investments in Marketable Securities</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On November&nbsp;2, 2001, Anthem Inc. (&#147;Anthem&#148;), a mutual insurance company in
which the Company held various medical and vision insurance policies for
coverage of its employees, converted from a mutual company to a publicly owned
company in a transaction known as a demutualization. As a mutual company, the
owners of Anthem were the policyholders. Upon demutualization, the Company
received 459,223 shares, which represented the Company&#146;s ownership interest in
the newly created stock enterprise. In 2001, the Company recorded a gain of
$19.7&nbsp;million based on the fair market value of the stock on the date of
receipt and an additional $3.0&nbsp;million through December&nbsp;31, 2001 as a result of
increases in the stock price. These amounts are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) under the heading
&#147;Other income, net.&#148; In January&nbsp;2002, the Company sold its entire investment
in Anthem generating cash proceeds of $23.3&nbsp;million and an additional gain of
$0.6&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2001, the Company sold its investment in Corvis Corporation. At December
31, 2000, the Company had a $132.2&nbsp;million ($85.9&nbsp;million, net of tax)
unrealized holding gain on its investment in Corvis, which was included in
&#147;Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income&#148;. The market value of the investment
declined during 2001 by $69&nbsp;million, net of taxes, before the Company entered
into a forward sale contract with a financial institution to hedge its exposure
to this investment. Therefore, upon delivery of the shares, the Company
reclassified the remaining $17.0&nbsp;million after tax gain ($26.1&nbsp;million pretax) from &#147;Other comprehensive income (loss)&#148; to &#147;Loss (gain)&nbsp;on investments.&#148;
Proceeds received from the complete liquidation of the holdings totaled $81.9
million in 2001.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2001, the Company&#146;s entire investment in PSINet was liquidated through
settlement of a forward sale and sale of shares in the open market. The
Company received proceeds of $28&nbsp;million and recorded a realized pretax gain of
$17.0&nbsp;million in 2001 related to these transactions. The cost basis was
calculated based on the specifically identified cost. There was no unrealized
gain or loss related to the investment included in &#147;Other Comprehensive Income&#148;
as of December&nbsp;31, 2001 as it was reclassified to a realized gain on
investment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Investments in Other Securities</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company periodically enters into certain equity investments for the
promotion of business and strategic objectives. A portion of these investments
is in securities, which do not have readily determinable fair market values.
These investments are recorded at cost based on specific identification. The
carrying value of cost method investments was approximately $4.2&nbsp;million and
$8.4&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company
reviews these investments on a regular basis using external valuations and cash
flow forecasts as factors in determining the existence of an &#147;other than
temporary&#148; impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a
loss of $11.2&nbsp;million on a cost based investment as the investment was
determined to be &#147;other than temporarily&#148; impaired. In 2003, the Company
received $3.8&nbsp;million from the sale of this cost basis investment.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Credit Facilities</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>General</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In November&nbsp;1999, the Company obtained credit facilities totaling $1,800.0
million from a group of lending institutions. The credit facilities were
increased to $2,100.0&nbsp;million in January&nbsp;2000 and again to
$2,300.0&nbsp;million in
June&nbsp;2001. Total availability under the credit facilities decreased to
$1,825.0&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2002, following a $335.0&nbsp;million prepayment
of the outstanding term debt facilities in the first quarter of 2002 (resulting
from the sale of substantially all of the assets of Cincinnati Bell Directory),
$5.0&nbsp;million in scheduled repayments of the term debt facilities and $135.0
million in a scheduled commitment reduction of the revolving credit facility.
In 2003, total availability under these credit facilities decreased by $904.5
million to $920.5&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, due to permanent prepayments
of $220.0&nbsp;million and $488.8&nbsp;million with net cash proceeds from the 16% Senior
subordinated discount notes and the 7&#188;% senior notes due 2013,
respectively, in addition to $195.0 of scheduled repayments of term debt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On March&nbsp;26, 2003, the Company permanently prepaid $220.0&nbsp;million in borrowings
under the term and revolving credit facilities and made a $90.0&nbsp;million payment
under the revolving credit facility with the net cash proceeds from the 16%
Senior subordinated discount notes and amended certain terms of the credit
facilities. On July&nbsp;11, 2003 the Company permanently prepaid $488.8&nbsp;million in
borrowings under the term and revolving credit facilities with the net cash
proceeds from the 7&#188;% senior notes due 2013. On November&nbsp;17, 2003, the
Company amended the existing credit facilities to provide for a new Term Loan D
facility of $525.0&nbsp;million. The Term Loan D facility was used to prepay all
outstanding term loans under the Company&#146;s credit facilities, which totaled
$327.2&nbsp;million, and to permanently pay down the revolving credit facility by
$197.8&nbsp;million. The Term Loan D facility will mature on June&nbsp;30, 2008 and
bears interest at a rate of 250 basis points over LIBOR. In 2003 the Company
recorded $4.7&nbsp;million of non-cash interest expense related to the amendment of
the credit facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Use of Credit Facilities</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">At December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had drawn approximately $608.4&nbsp;million from
the credit facilities&#146; capacity of approximately $920.5&nbsp;million, and had
outstanding letters of credit totaling $12.6&nbsp;million, leaving $299.5&nbsp;million in
additional borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. The credit
facilities&#146; borrowings have been used to refinance debt assumed as part of the
merger with BRCOM in November&nbsp;1999 and to fund capital expenditures and other
working capital needs.



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">92

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Prior to December&nbsp;2001, BRCOM relied solely on advances from the Parent for
funding its operations and capital program in excess of cash provided by its
operating activities. In December&nbsp;2001, BRCOM&#146;s subsidiary, BCSI Inc., began
borrowing funds directly from the credit facilities. Apart from an immaterial
amount of outstanding letter of credit balances, BSCI Inc. borrowings were
permanently paid down in conjunction with the closing of the Term D financing
on November&nbsp;17, 2003. Under the amended terms of the Company&#146;s credit
facilities, BRCOM and its subsidiaries are no longer able to borrow from the
credit facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Interest Rates</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest, at the Company&#146;s
election, at either (1)&nbsp;LIBOR plus 425 basis points in the case of the
revolving credit facility and 250 basis points in the case of the term facility
or (2)&nbsp;the base rate (as defined below) plus 325 basis points in the case of
the revolving credit facility and 150 basis points in the case of the term
facility. The &#147;base rate&#148; is equal to the higher of the base rate at Citibank,
N.A. or the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent. The
weighted-average interest rate on the revolving and term credit facilities was
4.89%, 4.47% and 6.28% for years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Maturity and Amortization</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Loans under the Term Loan D facility mature on June&nbsp;30, 2008, and amortize
under a schedule providing for quarterly installments in aggregate annual
amounts of $5&nbsp;million in 2004 and through June&nbsp;30, 2007 and in equal quarterly
installments of the remaining $505.3 in the period from July&nbsp;1, 2007 through
June&nbsp;30, 2008. The revolving credit facility commitment terminates on March&nbsp;1,
2006, and amortizes under a schedule providing for four equal quarterly
reductions of approximately $30.8&nbsp;million each in 2005 in an aggregate amount
equal to $123.3&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Fees</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company pays commitment fees to the lenders quarterly on the undrawn
portions of its commitments at an annual rate equal to 62.5 basis points of the
unused amount of borrowing of the revolving credit facility. Additionally, the
Company pays letter of credit fees on the available amount under all
outstanding letters of credit equal to the margin payable on LIBOR loans under
the revolving facility and pays a fee to each issuing bank of 0.25% per annum
of its letter of credit commitment, and customary fees for the issuance of
letters of credit. These commitment fees were $2.2&nbsp;million, $1.1&nbsp;million and
$1.9&nbsp;million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the March&nbsp;26, 2003 amendment of the terms of the credit
facilities, the Company agreed to pay an amendment fee in an amount equal to 75
basis points for the revolving credit facility and 37.5 basis points for each
of the Term Loan A, B and C credit facilities, which amounted to $23.4&nbsp;million.
This amount was paid during the first quarter of 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Prepayments</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Subject to certain limited exceptions, borrowings under the credit facilities
are required to be prepaid:

</TR>

</TABLE>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Covenants</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The financing documents governing the credit facilities contain financial
covenants that require the maintenance of certain debt to EBITDA (as defined in
the Credit Agreement), senior secured debt to EBITDA and interest coverage
ratios, as well as limit the Company to certain maximum capital expenditures.
The credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants that, among other
things, limit the Company&#146;s ability to incur additional debt or liens; pay
dividends to shareowners; repurchase Cincinnati Bell common stock; sell, lease,
transfer or dispose of assets; and make investments and merge with another
company. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all of
the covenants of the credit facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Events of Default</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The credit facilities provide for events of default customary to facilities of
this type, including non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts;
incorrectness of representations and warranties in any material respect;
violation of covenants; cross-default and cross-acceleration; certain events of
bankruptcy or insolvency; certain material judgments; invalidity of any loan or
security document; change of control and certain ERISA events.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As a result of the restatement of the Company&#146;s previously issued financial
statements, discussed in Note 2, the Company was in default on its Credit
Agreement. In March&nbsp;2004, the Credit Agreement was amended to provide that the
restatement does not constitute an event of default.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s credit facilities provide that a bankruptcy or insolvency of
BRCOM or any of its subsidiaries, a judgment against BRCOM or any of its
subsidiaries and breaches by BRCOM or any of its subsidiaries of the negative
covenants would not constitute an event of default with respect to the Company.
These terms continue to allow remedies to be exercised against BRCOM and are
treated as BRCOM events of default, but not events of default of the Company.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>BRCOM Arrangements</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Pursuant to the amendment obtained in March&nbsp;2003, future net cash investments
or other cash infusions in BRCOM and its subsidiaries after October&nbsp;1, 2002,
are limited (subject to certain exceptions) to an aggregate amount not to
exceed the sum of (a) $118.0&nbsp;million plus (b)&nbsp;the aggregate amount of net cash
dividends and distributions paid by BRCOM and its subsidiaries to the Company
after October&nbsp;1, 2002 plus or minus (c)&nbsp;the net position of BRCOM and its
subsidiaries under the Company&#146;s centralized cash management system. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had the ability to invest or otherwise provide
an additional $79.8&nbsp;million in funding to BRCOM. Also, corporate separateness
covenants require the Company to maintain legal and operational separation
between BRCOM and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Cincinnati Bell and
its other subsidiaries, on the other hand.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>7&#188;% Senior Notes Due 2023</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In July&nbsp;1993, the Company issued $50.0&nbsp;million of 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2023
(the &#147;7&#188;% Senior notes due 2023&#148;). The indenture related to these 7&#188;%
Senior notes due 2023 does not subject the Company to restrictive financial
covenants. However, the indenture govrening the 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2023 contains a covenant
that provides that if the Company incurs certain liens on its property or
assets, the Company must secure the outstanding notes equally and ratably with
the indebtedness or obligations secured by such liens. The 7&#188;% Senior
notes due 2023 are secured with assets by virtue of the lien granted under the
Company&#146;s credit facilities. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, $50.0&nbsp;million in
aggregate principal amount of the 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2023 remains outstanding. Interest
on the 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2023 is payable semi-annually on June&nbsp;15 and December&nbsp;15. The
7&#188;% Senior notes due 2023 may not be redeemed by the Company prior to maturity. The
indenture governing 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2023 provides for an event of
default upon the default and acceleration of any other existing debt instrument
indebtedness which exceeds $20.0&nbsp;million. For each of the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 the Company recorded $3.6&nbsp;million of cash interest expense
related to the 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2023.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Capital Lease Obligations</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company leases facilities and equipment used in its operations, some of
which are required to be capitalized in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;13, &#147;Accounting for Leases&#148; (&#147;SFAS 13&#148;). SFAS 13
requires the capitalization of leases meeting certain criteria, with the
related asset being recorded in property, plant and equipment and an offsetting
amount recorded as a liability discounted to the present value. The Company
had $18.2&nbsp;million in total indebtedness relating to capitalized leases as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003, $12.9&nbsp;million of which was considered long-term. The Company
recorded a gain of $10.0&nbsp;million in the fourth of 2003 included in &#147;Other
income, net&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income (Loss) due to the modification of a capital lease for the Company&#146;s headquarters.
This modification required the lease to be reclassified from a capital lease to
an operating lease. This modification reduced capital lease obligations and
related accrued interest by $14.0&nbsp;million and gross fixed assets by $6.2
million. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 the Company
recorded $4.0&nbsp;million, $5.0&nbsp;million and $6.0&nbsp;million, respectively, of cash
interest expense related to capital lease obligations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On July&nbsp;11, 2003, the Company issued $500.0&nbsp;million of 7&#188;% senior unsecured
notes due 2013 (the &#147;7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013&#148;). Net proceeds totaled
$488.8&nbsp;million and were used to prepay term credit facilities and permanently
reduce commitments under the Company&#146;s revolving credit facility. As a result,
the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $8.4&nbsp;million during the third quarter
of 2003 to &#147;Interest expense and other financing costs&#148; to write-off deferred
financing costs related to the Company&#146;s existing credit facilities. Interest

all existing and future subordinated debt as of the date of issuance. The
Company&#146;s subsidiaries, excluding Cincinnati Bell Telephone, Cincinnati Bell
Wireless, and BRCOM and all of its subsidiaries except CBAD, unconditionally
guarantee the 7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013 on a senior unsecured basis. The indenture governing the
7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013 contains covenants including but not limited to
the following: limitations on dividends to shareowners and other restricted
payments; dividend and other payment restrictions affecting the Company&#146;s
subsidiaries such that the subsidiaries are not permitted to enter into an
agreement that would limit their ability to make dividend payments to the
parent; indebtedness; asset dispositions; transactions with affiliates; liens;
investments; issuances and sales of capital stock of subsidiaries; redemption
of debt that is junior in right of payment;
issuances of senior subordinated debt, restrictions on dealing with BRCOM and
its subsidiaries; and mergers and consolidations. The indenture governing
7&#188;% Senior notes due 2013 provides for an event of default upon the default
and acceleration of any other existing debt instrument which exceeds $20.0
million. The Company may redeem the 7&#188;% Senior Notes due 2013 for a
redemption price of 103.625%, 102.417%, 101.208%, and 100.000% after July&nbsp;15,
2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. For the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2003, the Company recorded $17.1&nbsp;million of cash interest expense related to
the senior notes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Other Short-Term Debt</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company maintains a short-term revolving vendor financing arrangement for
its information technology consulting business, which had an outstanding
balance of $2.7&nbsp;million and $2.6&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company has the ability to borrow up to $3.0&nbsp;million under
this arrangement, which is secured by an irrevocable $2.0&nbsp;million letter of
credit against its revolving credit facility. The interest rate charged on the
borrowings is variable based on the prime rate and was 6.0% during 2003 and
2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBT has $100.0&nbsp;million in notes outstanding that are guaranteed by
Cincinnati Bell Inc. but not the other subsidiaries of Cincinnati Bell Inc.
These notes have original maturities of up to 30&nbsp;years and mature at various
intervals between 2005 and 2028. Interest rates on this indebtedness range
from 6.33% to 7.27%. These notes may be redeemed at any time, subject to
proper notice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In November&nbsp;1998, CBT issued $150.0&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of
6.30% unsecured senior notes due 2028 (the &#147;6.30% notes&#148;), which are not
guaranteed. These notes may be redeemed at any time, subject to proper notice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The indenture governing these notes provides for an event of default upon a
default and associated right to accelerate of any other existing debt
instrument of Cincinnati Bell Inc. or Cincinnati Bell Telephone, which exceeds
$20.0&nbsp;million. As a result of the restatement of the Company&#146;s previously
issued financial statements, discussed in Note 2, the Company was in default on
its Credit Agreement and 16% Notes Indenture, and as a result of the
cross-default provisions noted above, the Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes. In
March&nbsp;2004, the Credit Agreement and 16% Notes Indenture were amended to
provide that such restatement does not constitute an event of default, which
eliminated the cross-default of the Cincinnati Bell Telephone Notes. For the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2002 the Company recorded $17.7
million, $18.4&nbsp;million and $19.2&nbsp;million, respectively, of cash interest
expense related to these CBT notes.

from the issuance of the 16% Senior Subordinated Discount notes due 2009 (the
&#147;16% notes&#148;). Proceeds from the 16% notes, net of fees, were used to pay down

January&nbsp;20, 2009, whereby 12% is paid in cash and 4% is accreted on the
aggregate principal amount. In addition, purchasers of the 16% notes received
17.5&nbsp;million common stock warrants, subject to antidilution provisions, each to
purchase one share of Cincinnati Bell common stock at $3.00 each, which expire
in March&nbsp;2013. Of the total gross proceeds received, $47.5&nbsp;million was
allocated to the fair value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model and was recorded as a discount on the 16% notes. The
effective interest rate for the 16% notes is 23.8% due to the discount upon
issuance and accretion of the principal amount. Excluding the discount on the
16% notes, the effective interest rate is 19.0%. In 2003, the Company
recognized $6.3&nbsp;million of non-cash interest expense related to the
amortization of the discount. Through December&nbsp;31, 2003 and since inception,
the Company has recorded $10.6&nbsp;million in cumulative, non-cash interest expense
and has adjusted the carrying amount of the debt accordingly. The Company
incurred $32.0&nbsp;million of cash interest expense related to these notes in 2003.
The Company may
redeem the 16% notes after March&nbsp;26, 2006 for a redemption price of 108%, after
March&nbsp;26, 2007 for a redemption price of 106%, after March&nbsp;26, 2008 for a
redemption price of 104%, and for the principal amount of the notes at maturity
on January&nbsp;20, 2009. On any interest payment date prior to March&nbsp;26, 2006, the
Company may redeem the 16% notes for an amount equal to the accreted value plus
the make whole premium as defined in the indenture.

amended to provide that such restatement does not constitute an event of
default.

On November 19, 2003, the Company issued $540.0 million of 8 3/8% Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2014 (&#147;the 8 3/8% notes&#148;). The net proceeds, after deducting the initial
purchasers' discounts and fees and expenses related to the 8 3/8% notes totaled $528.2
million. The Company used $524.6 million of the net proceeds to purchase all of the
Company&#146;s outstanding Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009, which bore interest at a
rate of 9%, at a discounted price equal to 97% of their accreted value. The remaining
proceeds were used to pay fees related to the credit facility amendment discussed above
and to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
Interest on the 8 3/8% notes is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and
July 15, commencing on July 15, 2004.  The 8 3/8% notes are unsecured senior subordinated
obligations, subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Convertible Subordinated Notes</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In July&nbsp;1999, the Company issued $400.0&nbsp;million of 10-year, convertible
subordinated debentures to Oak Hill Capital Partners, L.P. These notes were
convertible into common stock of the Company at an adjusted price of $29.27 per
common share at the option of the holder. In March&nbsp;2003, the Company entered
into a supplemental indenture amending certain terms governing the Convertible
Subordinated Notes. The supplemental indenture
increased the paid-in-kind interest by 2&#188;% from March&nbsp;2003 through
redemption in July&nbsp;2009, resulting in a per annum interest rate of 9%. The
supplemental indenture also allowed for the sale of substantially all of the
assets of the Company&#146;s Broadband segment, provided that a bankruptcy of BRCOM
would not constitute an event of default, amended the definition of change in
control by increasing the ownership threshold deemed to be a change in control
from 20% of outstanding shares to 45% of outstanding shares and included
covenants restricting the ability of the Company to incur debt and consummate
certain asset dispositions. On November&nbsp;19, 2003, the Company purchased, with
the net proceeds from the 8 3/8% notes, all of the outstanding Convertible
Subordinated Notes at a discounted price of $524.6&nbsp;million, which was equal to
97% of their accreted value on November&nbsp;19, 2003. This transaction resulted in
a non-cash gain on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive
Income (Loss) included in &#147;Other income, net&#148; of $16.2&nbsp;million. During the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 the Company recorded $38.1
million, $32.3&nbsp;million and $30.3&nbsp;million, respectively, of non-cash interest
expense related to the convertible subordinated notes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>9% Senior Subordinated Notes (BRCOM)</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 1998, BRCOM (then known as IXC Communications) issued $450.0&nbsp;million of 9%
senior subordinated notes due 2008 (&#147;the 9% notes&#148;). In January&nbsp;2000, $404.0
million of these 9% notes were redeemed through a tender offer as a result of
the change of control provision of the related indenture. In March&nbsp;2003, the
Company entered into an exchange and voting agreement with holders of the 9%
notes. On September&nbsp;8, 2003, the Company exchanged the remaining $46.0&nbsp;million
of the 9% notes and $1.6&nbsp;million in accrued interest for approximately 11.1
million shares of common stock of the Company, which had a fair value of $65.0
million at the exchange date. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on
extinguishment of debt of $17.4&nbsp;million during the third quarter of 2003
included in &#147;Other income, net&#148; on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss). Upon completion of the exchange, the indenture
related to the 9% notes was terminated. During the years ended December&nbsp;31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 the Company recorded $2.9&nbsp;million, $4.2&nbsp;million and $3.7
million, respectively, of cash interest expense related to the convertible

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Interest Rate Contracts</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">From time to time the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements with
the intent of limiting its exposure to movements in interest rates. Interest
rate swap agreements are contractual agreements between two parties for the
exchange of interest payment streams on a notional principal amount at an
agreed upon fixed or floating rate, for a defined time period. These
agreements are hedges against movements in the LIBOR rate, which determines the
rate of interest paid by the Company on debt obligations under its credit
facilities (refer to Note 8). Realized gains and losses from the interest rate
swaps are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in each period. The
Company recorded $6.8&nbsp;million, $13.3&nbsp;million and $4.6&nbsp;million in interest
expense related to interest rate swap agreements for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The Company&#146;s interest rate swap agreements expired throughout 2003. During
2003, the fair value of the interest rate swaps increased resulting in a
year-to-date, after-tax net gain of $4.5&nbsp;million, which was recognized in OCI.

$412.4&nbsp;million of minority interest obligations and $64.9&nbsp;million in accrued
dividends of the Company. Additional-paid-in-capital increased $469.2&nbsp;million,
net of fees of $8.1&nbsp;million, as a result of the exchange. Concurrently with
the preferred stock exchange offer, the Company solicited consents from holders
of BRCOM preferred stock to amend the certificate of designation under
which the shares were issued to eliminate all voting rights and restrictive
covenants. Upon completion of the exchange and a related subsidiary merger,
there are no longer any shares of the 12&#189;% Preferreds outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Prior to the exchange, dividends on the 12&#189;% Preferreds were classified as
&#147;Minority interest expense&#148; in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss) and were approximately $32.0&nbsp;million in 2003 and

Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) under the
caption &#147;Minority interest expense.&#148; Under the terms of the related operating
agreement, AWE has the right to require CBW to purchase its 19.9% ownership
interest for a cash price equal to fair market value. Such right is
exercisable beginning on December&nbsp;31, 2006 and at any time thereafter, or if at

Corporation (&#147;Convergys&#148;), a provider of billing, customer service and other
services, which remains in effect until June&nbsp;30, 2008. The contract states
that Convergys will be the primary provider of certain data processing,
professional and consulting, technical support and customer support services
for the Company. In return, the Company will be the exclusive provider of
local telecommunications services to Convergys. In 2003, the Company signed a
letter of intent to revise the contract, which would extend the contract
through December&nbsp;31, 2010 and reduce the Company&#146;s annual commitment in 2004
and 2005 to $35.0&nbsp;million from $45.0&nbsp;million. Beginning in 2006, the minimum
commitment would be reduced 5% annually. The Company expects to finalize this
agreement in the second quarter of 2004. If the Company does not execute the final agreement, the Company
could be obligated to make a payment to Convergys of 40% of the difference
between the commitment and actual amount of services purchased, or
approximately $1.6&nbsp;million in 2004 based on a projected shortfall of $4.0.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Between October and December&nbsp;2002, five virtually identical class action
lawsuits were filed against Broadwing Inc. and two of its former Chief
Executive Officers in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">These complaints were filed on behalf of purchasers of the Company&#146;s securities
between January&nbsp;17, 2001 and May&nbsp;20, 2002, inclusive, and alleged violations of
Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by, inter
alia, (1)&nbsp;improperly recognizing revenue associated with Indefeasible Right of
Use (&#147;IRU&#148;) agreements; and (2)&nbsp;failing to write-down goodwill associated with
the Company&#146;s 1999 acquisition of IXC Communications, Inc. The plaintiffs seek
unspecified compensatory damages, attorney&#146;s fees, and expert expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;30, 2002, the &#147;Local 144 Group&#148; filed a motion seeking
consolidation of the complaints and appointment as lead plaintiff. By order
dated October&nbsp;29, 2003, Local 144 Nursing Home Pension Fund, Paul J. Brunner
and Joseph Lask were named lead plaintiffs in a putative consolidated class
action.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;1, 2003, lead plaintiffs filed their amended consolidated complaint
on behalf of purchasers of the Company&#146;s securities between January&nbsp;17, 2001

the amended filing. The Company&#146;s motion to dismiss was filed on February&nbsp;6,
2004. Plaintiffs have until April&nbsp;2, 2004 to file their opposition, and the
Company is required to file its reply by May&nbsp;17, 2004. The timing and outcome
of these matters are not currently predictable. An unfavorable outcome could
have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations and

Savings and Security Plan, the Broadwing Retirement Savings Plan, and a class
of participants in the Plans, generally allege that the defendants breached
their fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (&#147;ERISA&#148;) by improperly encouraging the Plan participant-plaintiffs to
elect to invest in the Company stock fund within the relevant Plan and by
improperly continuing to make employer contributions to the Company stock fund
within the relevant Plan.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2000, BRCOM entered into a long-term construction contract to build a
fiber route system. During the second quarter of 2002, the customer
alleged a breach of contract and requested the Company to cease all
construction activities, requested a refund of $62.0&nbsp;million in progress
payments previously paid to the Company, and requested conveyance of title to
all routes constructed under the contract. Subsequently, the Company notified
the customer that such purported termination was improper and constituted a
material breach under the terms of the contract, causing the Company to
terminate the contract. As a result of the contract termination, the Company
expensed $13.3&nbsp;million in both costs incurred under the contract and estimated
shutdown costs during the second quarter of 2002. In February&nbsp;2004, the
Company and El Paso Global Networks reached a final settlement of the
arbitration proceeding. Under the terms of the settlement, both parties agreed
to release their respective claims for monetary damages. As a result of the
settlement, the Company recorded a $5.2&nbsp;million charge included in &#147;Asset
Impairments and Other Charges (Credits)&#148; in the Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the fourth quarter of 2003. The operating
expenses were related to the increase in obligations assumed, indemnities
granted and warranties provided under the terms of the settlement agreement
over what had been previously recorded.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company has indemnified the buyer of the broadband assets against certain
potential claims, including environmental, tax, title and authorization,
broker, and other general claims. The title and authorization indemnification
is capped at 100% of the purchase price of the broadband assets, which
initially was $91.5&nbsp;million, subject to reductions under the terms of the
purchase agreement. The environmental and general indemnifications are capped
at 50% of the purchase price of the broadband assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In order to determine the fair value of the indemnification obligations and
warranties provided to the buyers of the broadband assets, the Company
performed a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis, utilizing the
minimum and maximum potential claims and several scenarios within the range of
possibilities. The analysis resulted in a $7.8&nbsp;million estimated fair value of
the indemnification obligations, which is included in other liabilities and has
been reflected as a reduction of the gain on sale of broadband assets in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In February&nbsp;2004, the Company reached a final settlement with a customer
related to a disputed construction contract, discussed above. As a result of
the terms of the settlement, the Company recorded $3.2&nbsp;million related to
indemnities granted and warranties provided under the terms of the settlement
agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In order to determine the fair value of the indemnification obligations and
warranties provided under the settlement agreement, the Company utilized a best
estimates approach when possible and for certain indemnifications performed a probability-weighted
discounted cash flow analysis, utilizing the minimum and maximum potential
claims and certain scenarios within the range of possibilities. The analysis
resulted in a $3.2&nbsp;million estimated fair value of the indemnification
obligations, which is included in other liabilities and has been reflected as
an other operating expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as special purpose
entities (&#147;SPEs&#148;) or variable interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;), which would have been
established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or
other limited purposes. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003 the Company is not involved in
any unconsolidated SPEs or VIEs.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Common Shares</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The par value of the Company&#146;s common shares is $.01 per share. At December
31, 2003 and 2002, common shares outstanding were 244.6&nbsp;million and 218.7
million, respectively. In July&nbsp;1999, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">shares of the Company. The 244.6&nbsp;million shares of Company common
shares outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2003, are net of approximately 7.9&nbsp;million
shares that were repurchased by the Company under its share repurchase program
and certain management deferred compensation arrangements for a total cost of
$145.5&nbsp;million.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In the first quarter of 1997, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors adopted a Share
Purchase Rights Plan by granting a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right for each outstanding common share to shareowners of
record at the close of business on May&nbsp;2, 1997. Under certain conditions, each
right entitles the holder to purchase one-thousandth of a Series&nbsp;A Preferred
Share. The rights cannot be exercised or transferred apart from common shares,
unless a person or group acquires 15% or more, or 20% or more for certain
groups, of the Company&#146;s outstanding common shares. The rights will expire May
2, 2007, if they have not been redeemed. The plan was amended in 2002. Under
the original plan, no single entity was allowed to hold 15% of the Company&#146;s
outstanding shares. The amendment increased the allowed threshold from 15% to
20% for an investment adviser within the meaning of the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940, and/or its affiliates.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Preferred Shares</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company is authorized to issue 1,357,299 voting preferred shares without
par value and 1,000,000 nonvoting preferred shares without par value.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company issued 155,250 voting shares of 6&#190;% cumulative convertible
preferred stock at stated value. These shares were subsequently deposited into
a trust in which the underlying 155,250 shares are equivalent to 3,105,000
depositary shares. Shares of this preferred stock can be converted at any time
at the option of the holder into common stock of the Company at a conversion
rate of 1.44 shares of Company common stock per depositary share of 6&#190;%
convertible preferred stock. Dividends on the 6&#190;% convertible preferred
stock are payable quarterly in arrears in cash, or common stock in certain
circumstances if cash payment is not legally permitted. The liquidation
preference on the 6&#190;% preferred shares is $1,000 per share (or $50 per
depositary share).



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>13. Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share from Continuing Operations</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Basic earnings (loss)&nbsp;per common share from continuing operations (&#147;EPS&#148;) is
based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that would occur if common
stock equivalents were exercised, but only to the extent that they are
considered dilutive to the Company&#146;s earnings. The following table is a
reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS
computations for earnings (loss)&nbsp;from continuing operations for the following
periods:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had approximately $1,856.3&nbsp;million of
federal operating loss tax carryforwards, with a deferred tax asset value of
$649.7&nbsp;million, and $333.5&nbsp;million in deferred tax assets related to state and
local operating loss tax carryforwards. Tax loss carryforwards will generally
expire between 2011 and 2023. U.S. tax laws limit the annual utilization of
tax loss carryforwards of acquired entities. These limitations should not
materially impact the utilization of the tax carryforwards.

for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The net decrease
in the valuation allowance of $948.5&nbsp;million during 2003 was primarily due to
the reversal of the valuation allowance related to the uncertainties
surrounding BRCOM&#146;s liquidity, which were substantially mitigated during the
fourth quarter of 2003. The remaining valuation allowance is necessary due to
the uncertainties surrounding the ability of the Company to utilize certain
state net operating loss carry forwards before expiration.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon the
Company&#146;s ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which
basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the
expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. The Company concluded, due
to the sale of the broadband business and the historical and future projected
earnings of the remaining businesses, that the Company will utilize future
deductions and available net operating loss carryforwards prior to their
expiration. The Company also concluded that it was more likely than not that
certain state tax loss carryforwards would not be realized based upon the
analysis described above and therefore provided a valuation allowance.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>15. Employee Benefit Plans</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Pension and Postretirement Plans</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company sponsors three noncontributory defined benefit pension plans: one
for eligible management employees, one for non-management employees and one
supplemental, nonqualified, unfunded plan for certain senior executives.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The management pension plan is a cash balance plan in which the pension benefit
is determined by a combination of compensation-based credits and annual
guaranteed interest credits. The non-management pension plan is also a cash
balance plan in which the pension benefit is determined by a combination of
service and job-classification-based credits and annual interest credits.
Benefits for the supplemental plan are based on eligible pay, adjusted for age
and service upon retirement. Funding of the management and non-management
plans is achieved through contributions to an irrevocable trust fund. The
contributions are determined using the aggregate cost method. The Company uses
the traditional unit credit cost method for determining pension cost for
financial reporting purposes and uses a December&nbsp;31 measurement date for all of
its plans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company also provides health care and group life insurance benefits for
eligible retirees. The Company funds certain group life insurance benefits
through Retirement Funding Accounts and funds health care benefits and other
group life insurance benefits using Voluntary Employee Benefit Association
(&#147;VEBA&#148;) trusts. It is the Company&#146;s practice to fund amounts as deemed
appropriate from time to time. Contributions are subject to IRS limitations
developed using the aggregate cost method.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The actuarial expense calculation for the postretirement health plan is based
on numerous assumptions, estimates and judgments including health care cost
trend rates and cap-related cost sharing. Certain of the Company&#146;s
non-management labor contracts contain an annual dollar value cap for the
purpose of determining postretirement health care contributions required from
retirees. The Company has waived cost sharing in excess of the cap during the
current contract period, but will begin collecting certain cost sharing
payments from certain non-management employees beginning in 2004. The caps for
certain contracts are set during each bargaining cycle in connection with the
negotiation of the overall contract. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS
106, the Company accounts for non-management retiree health benefits in
accordance with the terms of each individual contract.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company made the one-time election under FSP 106-1 to defer accounting for
any effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
Act of 2003. The Company has elected to defer the accounting effects of the
Act until the FASB issues guidance on how to account for the federal subsidy.
The Company expects the Act to reduce its annual non-cash postretirement health
expense by approximately $1&nbsp;million and reduce its postretirement health
liability by up to $12&nbsp;million, assuming no plan design changes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The following information relates to all Company noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans, postretirement health care, and life insurance benefit
plans. Pension and postretirement benefit costs are as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, developed using the
building block approach, is based on the following: the participant&#146;s benefit
horizons; the mix of investments held directly by the plans; and the current
view of expected future returns, which is influenced by historical averages.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can
impact the Company&#146;s operating results, financial position and cash flows.
Actual asset return experience results in an increase or decrease in the asset
base and this effect, in conjunction with a decrease in the pension discount
rate, may result in a plan&#146;s assets being less than a plan&#146;s accumulated benefit
obligation (&#147;ABO&#148;). The ABO is the present value of benefits earned to date
and is based on past compensation levels. The Company is required to show in
its consolidated balance sheet a net liability that is at least equal to the
ABO less the market value of plan assets. This liability is

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Savings Plans</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company sponsors several defined contribution plans covering substantially
all employees. The Company&#146;s contributions to the plans are based on matching
a portion of the employee contributions, on a percentage of employee earnings.
Company and employee contributions are invested in various investment
funds at the direction of the employee. Total Company contributions to the
defined contribution plans were $6.6&nbsp;million, $8.8&nbsp;million and $10.3&nbsp;million
for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>16. Stock-Based Compensation Plans</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During 2003 and in prior years, certain employees and directors of the Company
were granted stock options and other stock-based awards under the Company&#146;s
Long-Term Incentive Plans (&#147;Company LTIP&#148;). Under the Company LTIP, options are
granted with exercise prices that are no less than market value of the stock at
the grant date. Generally, stock options and stock appreciation rights have
ten-year terms and vesting terms of three to five years. The number of shares
authorized and available for grant under these plans were
approximately 78.3&nbsp;million and 28.4&nbsp;million, respectively, at December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Presented below is a summary of the status of outstanding Company stock options
issued to employees and related transactions (shares in thousands):

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In 2003 and 2002, there were no restricted stock awards granted. During 2001,
restricted stock awards were 65,000 shares and the weighted average market
value of the shares on the grant date was $24.41. Restricted stock awards
generally vest within one to five years. Total compensation expense for
restricted stock awards during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $0.3&nbsp;million, $3.8
million and $6.1&nbsp;million, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In January&nbsp;1999, the Company granted stock options to each of its then existing
employees (approximately 3,500). According to the terms of this program, stock
option grant recipients remaining with the Company until January&nbsp;2002 could
exercise their options to purchase up to 500 common shares each at an exercise
price of $16.75. This plan also includes a provision for option grants to
employees hired after the January&nbsp;1999 grant date, in smaller amounts and at an
exercise price based on the month of hire (e.g., employees hired during 2001
received options to purchase up to 300 common shares of the Company). Grant
recipients must exercise their options within ten years of the date of grant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2001, the Company announced an additional stock option grant to a
majority of its management employees. Each eligible employee was granted 300

the first quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $328.3
million ($211.8&nbsp;million, net of taxes), related to the sale of
these assets in the Consolidated Statements of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>19. Business Segment Information</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company is organized on the basis of products and services. The Company&#146;s
segments are strategic business units that offer distinct products and services
and are aligned with specific subsidiaries of the Company. The Company
operates in the four business segments, Local, Wireless, Other and Broadband,
as described below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Local segment provides local telephone service, network access, data
transport (including DSL), high-speed and dial-up Internet access, inter-lata
toll, telecommunications equipment, installation and maintenance as well as
other ancillary products and services to customers in southwestern Ohio,
northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. This market consists of
approximately 2,400 square miles located within an approximately 25-mile radius
of Cincinnati, Ohio. Services are provided through the Company&#146;s CBT
subsidiary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Wireless segment includes the operations of the CBW subsidiary, a venture
in which the Company owns 80.1% and AWE owns the remaining 19.9%. This segment
provides advanced digital personal communications and sales of related
communications equipment to customers in the Greater Cincinnati and Dayton,
Ohio operating areas.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Other segment combines the operations of Cincinnati Bell Any Distance
(&#147;CBAD&#148;) and Cincinnati Bell Public Communications Inc. (&#147;Public&#148;). CBAD
resells voice long distance service and Public provides public payphone
services.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Broadband segment previously provided data and voice communication services
nationwide through the Company&#146;s BRCOM subsidiary. These services were provided
over approximately 18,700 route miles of fiber-optic transmission facilities.
Broadband segment revenue was generated by broadband transport through private
line and IRU agreements, Internet services utilizing technology based on
Internet protocol (&#147;IP&#148;), and switched voice services provided to both
wholesale and retail customers. During the second and third quarters of 2003,
the Company sold substantially all of its broadband assets, which were reported
in the Broadband segment (refer to Note 3). The Broadband segment continues to
offer information technology consulting (&#147;IT consulting&#148;), data collocation and
managed services through the Company&#146;s CBTS subsidiary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBT will continue to market the buyers&#146; broadband products to business
customers and purchase capacity on the buyers&#146; national network in order to
sell long distance services, under the CBAD brand, to residential and business
customers in the Greater Cincinnati area market after the closing of the sale, subject to the terms of the agreements with the buyer.
Prior to the sale of substantially all the broadband assets, CBT recognized the
customer-invoiced amount as revenue and the related costs of providing service.
For results prior to June&nbsp;13, 2003 the Company has recast the Local segment and
Broadband segment results as if Broadwing had paid the difference between the
historical invoiced amount of revenue less related costs of providing service
as commission revenue.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For segment reporting purposes through the June&nbsp;13, 2003 first stage closing of
the sale of substantially all of the broadband assets, the Other segment
reported revenue for long distance switched voice minutes provided by the
Broadband segment to customers in the Greater Cincinnati area. The Other
segment recorded a corresponding cost of service based on the market rate
margins for the resale of long distance switched voice minutes to third
parties. The Broadband segment recorded revenue equal to the cost recorded in
the Other segment. The cost recorded by the Other segment and revenue
recorded by the Broadband segment were eliminated in consolidation. After the
completion of the first stage closing of the sale of the broadband assets, the
Other segment recorded revenue for customers in the Greater Cincinnati area,
but recorded costs to a third-party vendor, the buyer, which were no longer
eliminated in consolidation.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>20. Fair Value of Financial Instruments</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate, where practicable,
the fair value of each class of financial instruments:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Cash and cash equivalents, and current maturities of long-term debt &#151; The
carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of
these instruments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Accounts receivable and accounts payable &#151; The carrying amounts approximate
fair value.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Current and Long-term debt &#151; The fair value is estimated based on year-end closing market
prices of the Company&#146;s debt and of similar liabilities. The carrying amounts
of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002 were
$2,269.6&nbsp;million and $2,519.4&nbsp;million, respectively. The estimated fair values
at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002 were $2,475.8&nbsp;million and $2,255.7&nbsp;million,
respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Convertible preferred stock &#151; The fair value of the 63/4% Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock at December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002 was $106.1&nbsp;million
and $54.3&nbsp;million, respectively, based on the trading value on
those dates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Interest rate risk management &#151;The Company is exposed to the impact of interest
rate changes. The Company&#146;s objective is to manage the impact of interest rate
changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs.
The Company continuously monitors the ratio of variable to fixed interest rate
debt to maximize its total return. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002
approximately 74% and 51% of debt, respectively, was fixed-rate debt and
approximately 26% and 49%, respectively, were bank loans with variable interest
rates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>21. Supplemental Guarantor Information</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CBT Notes</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">CBT, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Company, has registered debt
outstanding that is guaranteed by the Parent Company but not by other
subsidiaries of the Parent Company. The guarantee is full and unconditional
and is joint and several. Substantially all of the Parent Company&#146;s income and
cash flow is generated by its subsidiaries. Generally, funds necessary to meet
the Parent Company&#146;s debt service obligations are provided by distributions or
advances from its subsidiaries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The following information sets forth the consolidating balance sheets of the
Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, and 2002 and the consolidating statements of
operations and cash flows for the three years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and
2001 of (1)&nbsp;Cincinnati Bell Inc., the Parent Company and guarantor (2)&nbsp;CBT, the
issuer and (3)&nbsp;the non-guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis:

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company restated its previously reported
results for the second quarter of 2003 and decreased accounts receivable by
$50.5&nbsp;million as discussed in Note 2. The effect of the restatement on the
second quarter was to decrease cost of services and products by $50.5&nbsp;million
and increase operating income and net income by the same amount.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2003 Unusual Items</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the first quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non-recurring increase to
net income of $85.9&nbsp;million, net of tax, associated with the adoption of SFAS
143 as a change in accounting principle (refer to Note 1). The net effect of
the income related to depreciation previously recorded increased diluted
earnings per share by $0.39 in the first quarter.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the second, third and fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold substantially
all the assets of its broadband business (refer to Note 3). The Company
recorded a gain on sale of broadband assets of $299.0&nbsp;million, $37.3

and $0.4&nbsp;million, which contributed $1.20 and $0.16 to diluted earnings per
share in the second and third quarter, respectively and had an immaterial
effect on fourth quarter diluted earnings per share.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Company reached a final settlement agreement regarding a construction
contract that was in dispute in February&nbsp;2004. As part of the settlement, both
parties agreed to drop their respective claims for monetary damages. The
Company recorded a $5.2&nbsp;million charge in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a
result of this settlement. The net impact of this charge reduced the Company&#146;s
fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by $0.01.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the third quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a $17.4&nbsp;million non-cash
charge on the exchange of $46.0&nbsp;million of 9% Senior Subordinated Notes of
BRCOM for 11.1&nbsp;million shares of common stock in Cincinnati Bell Inc. The net
impact of this charge reduced the Company&#146;s diluted earnings per share by
$0.07. Additionally, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $8.4&nbsp;million to
interest expense to write-off deferred financing costs related to the Company&#146;s
credit facilities, which were reduced using the proceeds from the issuance of
the 7&#188;% Senior Notes due 2013. The net impact of this charge reduced the
Company&#146;s fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by $0.04.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash gain of $16.2
million due to the extinguishment of the Company&#146;s convertible subordinated
debentures, which were purchased at 97% of accreted value. The net impact of
this gain increased the Company&#146;s fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by $.04.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a gain of $10.0&nbsp;million due
to the modification of a lease at the Company&#146;s headquarters. This modification
required the lease to be reclassified from a capital lease to an operating
lease. The net impact of this gain increased the Company&#146;s fourth quarter diluted earnings
per share by $.02.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash income tax
benefit of $823.0&nbsp;million resulting primarily from the reversal of
substantially all the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the
uncertainties surrounding BRCOM&#146;s liquidity, which were substantially mitigated
in 2003. The net impact of the income tax benefit increased the Company&#146;s
fourth quarter diluted earnings per share by $3.08.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2002 Restatement</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company restated previously
reported results for the fourth quarter of 2002, as discussed in Note 2. The
impact of the restatement was to increase income tax expense by $18.0&nbsp;million,
as a valuation allowance was required as of December&nbsp;31, 2002 to reserve
against certain deferred tax assets.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In connection with the restatement, the Company made an adjustment that was
previously identified but deemed to be immaterial and was recorded in the period management identified the error. The impact of the 2002
adjustments was to decrease cost of services and products by $0.6&nbsp;million in
the first quarter of 2002 and increase cost of services and products by $0.6
million in the second quarter of 2002, with no impact on the full year results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>2002 Unusual Items</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the first quarter of 2002, the Company sold substantially all of the assets
of its CBD subsidiary. The net effect of the gain from the sale of CBD&#146;s asset
decreased loss per share by $0.97 in the first quarter.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the first quarter of 2002, the Company incurred a charge of $2&nbsp;billion, net
of tax, associated with the adoption of SFAS 142 and presented as a cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle (refer to Note 5). The net effect of
the goodwill write-down increased loss per share by $9.21 in the first quarter.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The cessation of goodwill amortization in 2002 in accordance with SFAS
142, contributed approximately $0.10 earnings per share each quarter.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In
the second quarter of 2002 the Company incurred a charge of
$13.3&nbsp;million for costs associated with the termination of the Company&#146;s
uncompleted network construction contract further discussed in Note 11. The
effect of the charge increased loss per share by $0.04 in the second quarter.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the second and third quarter of 2002, the Company terminated IRU contracts
with two customers (refer to Note 1), which contributed $18&nbsp;million and $41
million of revenue and operating income and $0.05 and $0.14 of earnings per share
in the second and third quarter, respectively.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a $2.2&nbsp;billion non-cash
pretax asset impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the Broadband
unit&#146;s assets to estimated fair market value. The effect of the impairment
charge increased the fourth quarter loss per share by $6.54.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge of $930.4&nbsp;million
to establish a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets as a
component of income tax expense. The effect of the valuation allowance
increased the fourth quarter loss per share by $4.26.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>23. Concentrations</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Substantially all of the Company&#146;s revenue is generated by serving customers in
the Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio areas. An economic downturn or natural
disaster occurring in this limited operating territory could have a
disproportionate effect on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows compared to similar companies of a national scope
and similar companies operating in different geographic areas.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">Approximately 73% of the consolidated revenue in 2003 was generated by Local,
Wireless and Other segments, which operate in and generate substantially all of
their revenue from the Greater Cincinnati area. Going forward, the Company
expects an even greater concentration of business in the Greater Cincinnati
area, as it will no longer generate substantial revenue from the Broadband
segment, which previously generated revenue nationally.

Financial Disclosure</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">No disagreements with accountants on any accounting or financial disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure occurred during the period covered by this report.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;9A. Internal Controls and Procedures</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company&#146;s management, including
the Company&#146;s President and Chief Executive Officer and the individual acting
in the capacity of Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Exchange Act Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and Rule&nbsp;15d-15(e). Based upon that evaluation,
the President and Chief Executive Officer and the individual acting in the
capacity of Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company&#146;s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 in timely
alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its
consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company&#146;s periodic
Securities and Exchange Commission filings. No significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses were identified in the evaluation and therefore, no
corrective actions were taken. There were no significant changes in the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In connection with the restatement of prior years&#146; financial statements
discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
deficiencies in internal control over the accounting for a particular broadband
network construction contract entered into in 2000 were identified. In
November&nbsp;2001, the Company publicly announced its intention to exit the
broadband network construction business. Thereafter, the Company did not enter
into any new network construction agreements and no revenue was recognized in
either 2002 or 2003 on this broadband network construction contract. As
previously disclosed, the Company effectively completed the sale of
substantially all of the assets of its broadband business in June&nbsp;2003.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">In addition, the Company has taken the following steps in connection with its continuing efforts to
further enhance its system of controls: (1)&nbsp;the appointment of
Brian A. Ross on
January&nbsp;12, 2004 to the position of Chief Financial Officer; (2)&nbsp;the
appointment of Gary A. Cornett on February&nbsp;24, 2004 to the position of Controller;
(3)&nbsp;the implementation of revised Purchasing, Spending and Capital
Authorization policies, detailing the corporate approval process required for,
among other things, purchase orders, expense vouchers and capital projects,
effective March&nbsp;31, 2004; (4)&nbsp;the engagement of independent consultants to
supplement the Company&#146;s efforts to comply with the Section&nbsp;404 requirements of
the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and to perform the Company&#146;s internal audit
function; and (5)&nbsp;the imposition of a mandatory requirement that all non-union
employees, including all officers, finance and accounting management staff,
annually review and affirm their understanding of, and intent to comply with,
the Company&#146;s Code of Business Conduct, effective May&nbsp;2003.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(1) Includes 30,007,052 outstanding stock options not yet exercised and 17,500 shares of restricted stock, restrictions
on which have not yet expired.  Awards were granted under various incentive plans approved by Cincinnati Bell Inc. shareholders.
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(2) The shares to be issued relate to deferred compensation to non-employee
directors, pursuant to the "Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors".
Under this plan, on the first day of each year, each non-employee director
receives, in his or her account, the equivalent of 1,500 common shares. The
non-employee directors generally vest in the respective account over a period of
five years, but are not eligible to receive disbursement from the account until
retirement from the board of directors. Upon retirement and to the extent
vested, each non-employee director receives distributions from the account in
the form of common shares. This mandatory distribution in the form of common
shares will not be in effect for future grants without shareholder approval.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For detail regarding the pro forma impact of stock options on the earnings per
share calculation, refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. For detail regarding the range of exercise prices on outstanding
stock options, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
