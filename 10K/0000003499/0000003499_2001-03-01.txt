Item 1.  Business

GENERAL

         Alexander's, Inc. (the "Company") is a real estate investment trust
("REIT") engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties.
Alexander's activities are conducted through its manager, Vornado Realty Trust
("Vornado").

         Alexander's has seven properties consisting of:

         Operating properties:

         (i)      the Rego Park I property located on Queens Boulevard and 63rd
                  Road in Rego Park, Queens, New York, which contains a 351,000
                  square foot building, which is 100% leased to Sears, Circuit
                  City, Bed Bath & Beyond, Marshalls and Old Navy;

         (ii)     the recently renovated Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center on
                  Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, New York, which contains
                  1,100,000 square feet is comprised of a two-level mall
                  containing 477,000 square feet (the "Mall), a 289,000 square
                  foot department store leased to Sears and another anchor
                  department store owned and operated as a Macy's by Federated
                  Department Stores, Inc. ("Federated");

         (iii)    the Flushing property located at Roosevelt Avenue and Main
                  Street in Flushing, New York, which contains a 177,000 square
                  foot building currently unoccupied; and

         (iv)     the Third Avenue property located at Third Avenue and 152nd
                  Street in the Bronx, New York, which contains a 173,000 square
                  foot building leased to an affiliate of Conway.

         Non-operating properties to be developed:

         (v)      the Lexington Avenue property which comprises the entire
                  square block bounded by Lexington Avenue, East 59th Street,
                  Third Avenue and East 58th Street in Manhattan, New York;

         (vi)     the Paramus property which consists of 30.3 acres of land
                  located at the intersection of Routes 4 and 17 in Paramus, New
                  Jersey; and

         (vii)    the Rego Park II property, which comprises one and one-half
                  square blocks of vacant land adjacent to the Rego Park I
                  property.

         The Company has completed the excavation and laying the foundation for
its Lexington Avenue property as part of the proposed development of a large
multi-use building. The proposed building is expected to be comprised of a
commercial portion, which may include a combination of retail stores, offices,
hotel space, extended stay residences, residential rentals and parking; and a
residential portion, consisting of condominium units. The capital required for
the proposed building will be in excess of $650,000,000.

         If the residential portion of the property is developed, the air rights
representing the residential portion would be transferred to a taxable REIT
subsidiary, as a REIT is not permitted to sell condominiums without being
subject to a 100% excise tax on the gain from the sale of such condominiums.

         The Company sold its Fordham road property, located in the Bronx, New
York, on January 12, 2001. The vacant property contains 303,000 square feet and
was sold for $25,500,000 resulting in a gain of $19,000,000. In addition, the
Company paid off the mortgage on this property at a discount, which resulted in
an extraordinary gain from the early extinguishment of debt of $3,500,000.

         Sears accounted for 21%, 22% and 28% of the Company's consolidated
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. No
other tenant accounted for more than 10% of revenues.


                                      -3-
<PAGE>   4
         The Company has completed a renovation of the Kings Plaza Regional
Shopping Center (the "Center") at a total cost of $48,000,000, of which
$42,392,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2000. Included in the
$48,000,000 is $15,000,000 that the Company agreed to pay Federated to renovate
its Macy's store at the Center. This agreement was part of the terms of the
acquisition, by the Company, of Federated's 50% interest in the Center in June
1998. The remainder of the Center renovation (the exterior) is expected to be
completed in 2001.

         In the aggregate, Alexander's operating properties do not generate
sufficient cash flow to pay all of its expenses. The Company's three
non-operating properties (Lexington Avenue, Paramus, and Rego Park II) are in
various stages of development. As rents commence from portions of the
development property(s) and from the vacant property, the Company expects that
cash flow will become positive.

         The Company estimates that the fair market values of its assets are
substantially in excess of their historical cost and that it has additional
borrowing capacity. Alexander's continues to evaluate its needs for capital,
which may be raised through (a) property specific or corporate borrowing, (b)
the sale of securities and (c) asset sales. Although there can be no assurance,
the Company believes that these cash sources will be adequate to fund cash
requirements until its operations generate adequate cash flow.

         The Company is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive
office located at 888 Seventh Avenue; New York, New York 10019, telephone
212-894-7000.


         Relationship with Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado")

         Vornado owns 33.1% of the Company's Common Stock at December 31, 2000,
of which 41,500 share were acquired on March 31, 2000 and 10,400 shares were
acquired on April 11, 2000. The Company is managed by, and its properties are
redeveloped and leased by Vornado, pursuant to agreements with a one-year term
expiring in March of each year which are automatically renewable.

         The annual management fee payable by the Company to Vornado is equal to
the sum of (i) $3,000,000, (ii) 3% of the gross income from the Mall, plus (iii)
6% of development costs with minimum guaranteed fees of $750,000 per annum. The
leasing agreement provides for the Company to pay a fee to Vornado equal to (i)
3% of the gross proceeds, as defined, from the sale of an asset and (ii) in the
event of a lease or sublease of an asset, 3% of lease rent for the first ten
years of a lease term, 2% of lease rent for the eleventh through the twentieth
years of a lease term and 1% of lease rent for the twenty-first through
thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of rents by tenants. Such
amount is payable annually in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000, until the
present value of such installments (calculated at a discount rate of 9% per
annum) equals the amount that would have been paid had it been paid on September
21, 1993, or at the time the transactions which gave rise to the Commissions
occurred, if later. At December 31, 2000 the Company does not owe Vornado any
leasing fees. Pursuant to the leasing agreement, in the event third party real
estate brokers are used, the fees to Vornado increase by 1% and Vornado is
responsible for the fees to the third party real estate brokers.

         At December 31, 2000, the Company is indebted to Vornado in the amount
of $115,000,000 comprised of (i) $95,000,000 relating to the subordinated
tranche of a $115,000,000 secured financing, and (ii) $20,000,000 under the line
of credit discussed below.

         On August 1, 2000, the Company obtained a $50,000,000 secured line of
credit from Vornado under the same terms and conditions as the existing
$95,000,000 loan from Vornado, including the interest rate of 15.72%. The
maturity date of the existing $95,000,000 loan has been extended to March 15,
2002, which is also the maturity date of the new line of credit. The interest
rate on the loan and line of credit will reset on March 15, 2001, using the same
spread to treasuries as presently exists. The proceeds of the secured line of
credit are being used for general corporate purposes including continuing to
fund the real estate development costs at its Lexington Avenue property. It is
expected that a construction loan will be obtained to finance the development of
the Lexington Avenue property.

         These loans are secured by liens on all of the Company's assets and/or
pledges of the stock of subsidiaries owning the assets and/or guarantees of such
subsidiaries and the parent. The liens do not cover the Kings Plaza Regional
Shopping Center and Rego Park I and are subordinate to first mortgages and a
$20,000,000 bank term loan.

         Vornado is a fully integrated REIT with significant experience in the
ownership, development, leasing, operation and management of retail and office
properties.

         Steven Roth is Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company,
the Managing General Partner of Interstate Properties ("Interstate") and
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. At December 31,
2000, Mr. Roth, Interstate and the other two general partners of Interstate,
David Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. (who are also directors of the
Company and trustees of Vorndao) own, in the aggregate, 27.5% of the outstanding
common stock of the Company, and 17.7% of the outstanding common shares of
beneficial interest of Vornado.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         In June 1997, the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center (the "Center"),
commissioned an Environmental Study and Contamination Assessment Site
Investigation (the Phase II "Study") to evaluate and delineate environmental
conditions disclosed in a Phase I study. The results of the Study indicate the
presence of petroleum and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate contamination in the soil
and groundwater. The Company has delineated the contamination and has developed
a remediation approach. The New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation ("NYDEC") has not yet approved the remediation approach. The
Company accrued $2,000,000 in previous years ($1,678,000 has been paid as of
December 31, 2000) for its estimated obligation with respect to the clean up of
the site, which includes costs of (i) remedial investigation, (ii) feasibility
study, (iii) remedial design, (iv) remedial action and (v) professional fees. If
the NYDEC insists on a more extensive remediation approach, the Company could
incur additional obligations.

         The majority of the contamination may have resulted from activities of
third parties; however, the sources of the contamination have not been fully
identified. Although the Company intends to pursue all available remedies
against any potentially responsible third parties, there can be no assurance
that such parties will be identified, or if identified, whether these
potentially responsible third parties will be solvent. In addition, the costs
associated with pursuing any potentially responsible parties may be cost
prohibitive. The Company has not recorded an asset as of December 31, 2000 for
potential recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties.

         Compliance with applicable provisions of federal, state and local laws
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
to the protection of the environment have not had, and, although there can be no
assurance, are not expected to have, a material effect on the Company's
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

COMPETITION

         The Company conducts its real estate operations in the New York
metropolitan area, a highly competitive market. The Company's success depends
upon, among other factors, the trends of the national and local economies, the
financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants,
the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, construction and
renovation costs, income tax laws, governmental regulations and legislation,
population trends, the market for real estate properties in the New York
metropolitan area, zoning laws and the ability of the Company to lease, sublease
or sell its properties at profitable levels. The Company competes with a large
number of real estate property owners. In addition, although the Company
believes that it will realize significant value from its properties over time,
the Company anticipates that it may take a number of years before all of its
properties generate cash flow at or near anticipated levels. The Company's
success is also subject to its ability to finance its development and to
refinance its debts as they come due.

EMPLOYEES

         The Company currently has one corporate employee and 77 property level
employees.

Development Properties:

Lexington Avenue

     The Company owns the Lexington Avenue property which comprises the entire
square block bounded by Lexington Avenue, East 59th Street, Third Avenue and
East 58th Street and is situated in the heart of one of Manhattan's busiest
business and shopping districts with convenient access to several subway and bus
lines. The property is located directly across the street from Bloomingdale's
flagship store and only a few blocks away from both Fifth Avenue and 57th
Street.

         The Company has completed the excavation and laying the foundation for
its Lexington Avenue property as part of the proposed development of a large
multi-use building. The proposed building is expected to be comprised of a
commercial portion, which may include a combination of retail stores, offices,
hotel space, extended stay residences, residential rentals and parking; and a
residential portion, consisting of condominium units. The capital required for
the proposed building will be in excess of $650,000,000.

         If the residential portion of the property is developed, the air rights
representing the residential portion would be transferred to a taxable REIT
subsidiary, as a REIT is not permitted to sell condominiums without being
subject to a 100% excise tax on the gain from the sale of such condominiums.

Paramus

     The Company owns 30.3 acres of land located at the intersection of Routes 4
and 17 in Paramus, New Jersey. The Company's property is located directly across
from the Garden State Plaza regional shopping mall, within two miles of three
other regional shopping malls and within 10 miles of New York City.

     The Company may develop a shopping center of approximately 550,000 square
feet on this site. The estimated cost of such development is approximately
$100,000,000. The Company has received municipal approvals on tentative plans to
redevelop the site. No development plans have been finalized.

Rego Park II

     The Company owns two land parcels adjacent to the Rego Park I property.
They are the entire square block bounded by the Long Island Expressway, 97th
Street, 62nd Drive and Junction Boulevard and a smaller parcel of approximately
one-half square block at the intersection of 97th Street and the Long Island
Expressway. Both parcels are currently zoned for residential use. Both parcels
are being used for public paid parking. The Company intends to continue to use
these properties for paid parking while it evaluates development options.

Insurance

     The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage
and rental loss insurance with respect to its properties with policy
specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties.
Management of the Company believes that the Company's insurance coverage
conforms to industry norms.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

     Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, nor is their
property the subject of, any material pending legal proceeding other than
routine litigation incidental to their businesses. The Company believes that
these legal actions will not be material to the Company's financial condition or
results of operations.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the year ended December 31, 2000.

         As of December 31, 2000, there were approximately 1,700 holders of
record of the Company's common stock. The Company pays dividends only if, as and
when declared by its Board of Directors. No dividends were paid in 2000 and
1999. In order to qualify as a REIT, the Company generally is required to
distribute as a dividend 95% of its taxable income. At December 31, 2000, the
Company had net operating loss carryovers ("NOL's") of approximately
$146,000,000. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company's
NOL's generally would be available to offset the amount of the Company's REIT
taxable income that otherwise would be required to be distributed as a dividend
to stockholders.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
          Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

         The Company had net income of $5,197,000 for the year ended December
31, 2000 as compared to net income of $5,524,000 in the prior year. Net income
for 1999 is after a charge of $4,877,000 resulting from the write-off of the
asset arising from the straight-lining of rents primarily due to Caldor's
rejection of its Flushing lease.

         Details of the changes in the components of net income are discussed in
the comparison of the years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999 below.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         Years Ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999

         The Company's revenues, which consist of property rentals and tenant
expense reimbursements were $63,965,000 in 2000, compared to $64,390,000 in
1999, a decrease of $425,000.

         Property rentals were $43,173,000 in 2000, compared to $44,232,000 in
1999, a decrease of $1,059,000. This decrease resulted primarily from Caldor's
rejection of its Flushing lease effected March 29, 1999.

         Tenant expense reimbursements were $20,792,000 in 2000, compared to
$20,158,000 in 1999, an increase of $634,000. This increase resulted primarily
from higher reimbursements for a portion of the increased fuel costs of the
utility plant at the Company's Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center; partially
offset from a change made in the first quarter of 2000, in the method of
allocating an anchor tenant's share of parking lot expenses at the Rego Park I
property (which covered a number of years).

         Operating expenses were $29,040,000 in 2000, compared to $33,081,000 in
1999, a decrease of $4,041,000. This decrease resulted primarily from: (i)
$4,877,000 representing the write-off of the asset arising from the
straight-lining of rents due to Caldor's rejection of its Flushing lease in
1999, (ii) a decrease in repairs and maintenance of $1,243,000 in 2000,
partially offset by an increase in expenses of the utility plant at the
Company's Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center in the current year resulting
from higher fuel costs.

         General and administrative expenses were $3,885,000 in 2000, compared
to $3,692,000 in 1999, an increase of $193,000 primarily as a result of higher
professional fees.

         Interest and debt expense was $21,424,000 in 2000, compared to
$17,647,000 in 1999, an increase of $3,777,000. This increase resulted from (i)
an increase in average debt outstanding of $61,268,000, and (ii) an increase in
average interest rates from 8.50% to 10.07%, substantially offset by (iii) an
increase in capitalized interest relating to the Company's development
properties.

         Years Ended December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998

         The Company's revenues, which consist of property rentals, tenant
expense reimbursements and equity in income of unconsolidated joint venture
(prior to 1999) were $64,390,000 in 1999, compared to $51,663,000 in 1998, an
increase of $12,727,000.

         Property rentals were $44,232,000 in 1999, compared to $35,151,000 in
1998, an increase of $9,081,000. This increase resulted from:

</TABLE>

         Tenant expense reimbursements were $20,158,000 in 1999, compared to
$13,993,000 in 1998, an increase of $6,165,000. This increase resulted primarily
from the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the Kings Plaza Mall and
the resulting consolidation of its operations after June 18, 1998.

         The decrease in equity in income of unconsolidated joint venture
resulted from the consolidation of the Mall's operations in 1998 as noted above.

         Operating expenses were $33,081,000 in 1999, compared to $20,132,000 in
1998, an increase of $12,949,000. Of this increase (i) $9,254,000 primarily
resulted from the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the Kings Plaza
Mall and the resulting consolidation of the Mall's operations after June 18,
1998 and (ii) $4,877,000 resulted from the write-off of the asset arising from
the straight-lining of rents primarily due to Caldor's rejection of its Flushing
lease in 1999, partially offset by a decrease in real estate tax, repairs and
maintenance and parking garage expenses.

         General and administrative expenses were $3,692,000 in 1999, compared
to $4,079,000 in 1998, a decrease of $387,000 primarily as a result of lower
professional fees.

         Depreciation and amortization expense was $5,441,000 in 1999 compared
to $4,289,000 in 1998, an increase of $1,152,000 primarily as a result of the
acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the Kings Plaza Mall and the
resulting consolidation of its operations after June 18, 1998.

         In September 1998, the Company wrote-off $15,096,000 resulting from the
razing of the building formerly located at the Lexington Avenue site.

         Interest and debt expense was $17,647,000 in 1999, compared to
$15,115,000 in 1998, an increase of $2,532,000. This increase resulted primarily
from (i) higher average debt, partially offset by (ii) a decrease in the average
interest rate and (iii) an increase in capitalized interest relating to the
Company's development properties.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         In the aggregate, Alexander's operating properties do not generate
sufficient cash flow to pay all of its expenses. The Company's three
non-operating properties (Lexington Avenue, Paramus, and Rego Park II) are in
various stages of development. As rents commence from portions of the
development property(s) and from the vacant property, the Company expects that
cash flow will become positive.

         The Company may develop a shopping center of approximately 550,000
square feet on the Paramus Property. The estimated cost of such development is
approximately $100,000,000. The Company has received municipal approvals on
tentative plans to redevelop the site. No development plans have been finalized.

         The Company has completed the excavation and laying the foundation for
its Lexington Avenue property as part of the proposed development of a large
multi-use building. The proposed building is expected to be comprised of a
commercial portion, which may include a combination of retail stores, offices,
hotel space, extended stay residences, residential rentals and parking; and a
residential portion, consisting of condominium units. In connection therewith,
the Company let contracts for $28,000,000 to undertake the excavation and laying
the


                                      -14-
<PAGE>   15
foundation for the proposed development. $26,839,000 has been paid as of
December 31, 2000. The capital required for the proposed building will be in
excess of $650,000,000.

         If the residential portion of the property is developed, the air rights
representing the residential portion would be transferred to a taxable REIT
subsidiary, as a REIT is not permitted to sell condominiums without being
subject to a 100% excise tax on the gain from the sale of such condominiums.

         The Company sold its Fordham road property, located in the Bronx, New
York, on January 12, 2001. The vacant property contains 303,000 square feet and
was sold for $25,500,000 resulting in a gain of $19,100,000. In addition, the
Company paid off the $21,263,000 mortgage on this property at a discount, which
resulted in an extraordinary gain from the early extinguishment of debt of
$3,500,000.

         At December 31, 2000, the Company is indebted to Vornado in the amount
of $115,000,000 comprised of (i) $95,000,000 relating to the subordinated
tranche of a $115,000,000 secured financing, and (ii) $20,000,000 under the line
of credit discussed below.

         On August 1, 2000, the Company obtained a $50,000,000 secured line of
credit from Vornado under the same terms and conditions as the existing
$95,000,000 loan from Vornado, including the interest rate of 15.72%. The
maturity date of the existing $95,000,000 loan has been extended to March 15,
2002, which is also the maturity date of the new line of credit. The interest
rate on the loan and line of credit will reset on March 15, 2001, using the same
spread to treasuries as presently exists. The proceeds of the secured line of
credit are being used for general corporate purposes including continuing to
fund the real estate development costs at its Lexington Avenue property. It is
expected that a construction loan will be obtained to finance the Lexington
Avenue property.

         These loans are secured by liens on all of the Company's assets and/or
pledges of the stock of subsidiaries owning the assets and/or guarantees of such
subsidiaries and the parent. The liens do not cover the Kings Plaza Regional
Shopping Center and Rego Park I and are subordinate to first mortgages and a
$20,000,000 bank term loan.

         A summary of maturities of debt at December 31, 2000 is as follows:

                               2002                        115,000,000
                               2003                         36,263,000(2)
                               2004                            339,000
                               2005                            735,000
</TABLE>

         (1)      $114,525,000 of this amount relates to a first mortgage loan
                  secured by the Company's Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center
                  (the "Center"). The Company is currently negotiating
                  refinancing the Center with various outside lenders. Based on
                  the historical operating performance of the Center, management
                  believes that it has excess borrowing capacity over the
                  existing mortgage loan. The remaining $20,000,000 is a term
                  loan to a bank which was scheduled to mature on March 15,
                  2001. This loan has been extended to March 15, 2002.

         (2)      $21,263,000 of this amount was repaid on January 12, 2001 in
                  connection with the sale of the Fordham Road Property.

         The Company estimates that the fair market values of its assets are
substantially in excess of their historical cost and that it has additional
borrowing capacity. Alexander's continues to evaluate its needs for capital

the sale of securities and (c) asset sales. Although there can be no assurance,
the Company believes that these cash sources will be adequate to fund cash
requirements until its operations generate adequate cash flow.

         Funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating
activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is
not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, which is
disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable
periods. There are no material legal or functional restrictions on the use of
funds from operations. Funds from operations should not be considered as an
alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance
or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Management
considers funds from operations a relevant supplemental measure of operating
performance because it provides a basis for comparison among REITs; however,
funds from operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other REITs since the Company's method of calculating funds from
operations is different from that used by NAREIT. Funds from operations, as
defined by NAREIT, represents net income before depreciation and amortization,
extraordinary items and gains or losses on sales of real estate. Funds from
operations as disclosed above has been modified to adjust for the effect of
straight-lining of property rentals for rent escalations and leasing fee
expenses. Below are the cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing
and financing activities:

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

         In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS No. 133") which establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. The Company
is required to adopt SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 138, effective January
1, 2001. Because the Company does not currently utilize derivative instruments
or engage in hedging activities, management does not anticipate that
implementation of this statement will have a material effect on the Company's
financial statements.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

         At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had $170,788,000 and
$132,161,000 of variable rate debt at weighted average interest rates of 8.36%
and 8.43%. In addition, the Company had $197,000,000 in both years of fixed rate
debt bearing interest at weighted average interest rates of 12.19% and 10.58%. A
one percent increase in the base used to determine the interest rate of the
variable rate debt would result in a $1,708,000 decrease in the Company's annual
net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 ($.34 per basic and diluted
share).

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


Board of Directors and Stockholders
  of Alexander's, Inc.

Paramus, New Jersey

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alexander's,
Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the index at
Item 14(a)(2). These financial statements and financial statement schedules are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2000, and
1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS

   Alexander's Inc. (the "Company") is a real estate investment trust ("REIT")
engaged in leasing, managing, developing and redeveloping properties.
Alexander's activities are conducted through its manager, Vornado Realty Trust
("Vornado").

   In the aggregate, Alexander's operating properties do not generate sufficient
cash flow to pay all of its expenses. The Company's three non-operating
properties (Lexington Avenue, Paramus, and Rego Park II) are in various stages
of development. As rents commence from portions of the development property(s)
and from the vacant property, the Company expects that cash flow will become
positive.

   The Company estimates that the fair market values of its assets are
substantially in excess of their historical cost, and that it has additional
borrowing capacity. Alexander's continues to evaluate its needs for capital,
which may be raised through (a) property specific or corporate borrowing, (b)
the sale of securities and (c) asset sales. Although there can be no assurance,
the Company believes that these cash sources will be adequate to fund cash
requirements until its operations generate adequate cash flow.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Basis of Presentation -- The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications to
prior year amounts have been made to conform with the current year's
presentation. The Company currently operates in one business segment.

   The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Management has made estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   Cash and Cash Equivalents -- The Company includes in cash and cash
equivalents both cash and short-term highly liquid investments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents does not
include cash restricted for construction financing and operating liabilities
which is disclosed separately.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   Fair Value of Financial Instruments - All financial instruments of the
Company are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at
historical cost which, in management's estimation, based upon an interpretation
of available market information and valuation methodologies (including
discounted cash flow analyses with regard to fixed rate debt), reasonably
approximates their fair values. Such fair value estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition of the
Company's financial instruments.

   Real Estate and Other Property - Real estate and other property is carried at
cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on buildings and
improvements on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging
from four years to forty years. When real estate and other property is
undergoing development activities, all property operating expenses, including
interest expense, are capitalized to the cost of the real property to the extent
that management believes such costs are recoverable through the value of the
property.

   The Company's properties are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be
recoverable. In such an event, a comparison is made of the current and projected
operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an
undiscounted basis, to the carrying amount of such property. Such carrying
amount would be adjusted, if necessary, to reflect an impairment in the value of
the asset.

   Deferred Lease Expense - The Company capitalizes the costs incurred in
connection with obtaining long-term leases. Deferred lease expense is amortized
on the straight-line method over the initial terms of the leases.

   Deferred Debt Expense - The Company capitalizes the costs incurred in
connection with obtaining short-term or long-term debt or refinancing existing
debt. These costs are amortized on the straight-line method over the initial
terms of the debt, which approximates the interest method.

   Leases - All leases are operating leases whereby rents and reimbursements of
operating expenses are recorded, when due, as real estate operating revenue. The
straight-line basis is used to recognize rents under leases entered into which
provide for varying rents over the lease terms.

    Income Taxes - The Company operates in a manner intended to enable it to
continue to qualify as a REIT under sections 856 through 860 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Under the Code, the Company's net
operating loss ("NOL") carryovers generally would be available to offset the
amount of the Company's REIT taxable income that otherwise would be required to
be distributed as a dividend to its stockholders.

   The Company has reported NOL carryovers for federal tax purposes of
approximately $146,000,000 at December 31, 2000, expiring from 2005 to 2012. The
Company also has investment tax and targeted jobs tax credits of approximately
$3,000,000 expiring in 2002 through 2005.

   The net basis in the Company's assets and liabilities for tax purposes is
approximately $84,000,000 lower than the amount reported for financial statement
purposes.

   Amounts Per Share - Basic income (loss) per share excludes any dilutive
effects of stock options. Stock options outstanding were not dilutive in any
period.

    Stock Options - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method compensation cost is
measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company's
stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted.

options, if any, is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The Company's
policy is to grant options with an exercise price equal to the quoted market
price of the Company's stock on the grant date. Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized for the Company's stock option plans.

3.  ACQUISITION OF KINGS PLAZA MALL

    In June 1998, the Company increased its interest in the Kings Plaza Mall
(the "Mall") to 100% by acquiring Federated Department Store's ("Federated") 50%
interest. The purchase price was approximately $28,000,000, which was paid in
cash, plus the Company agreed to pay Federated $15,000,000 to renovate its
Macy's store in the Mall ($14,500,000 has been paid as of December 31, 2000) and
Federated agreed to certain modifications to the Kings Plaza Operating
Agreement. Prior to June 18, 1998, the Company owned a 50% interest in the Mall
and had accounted for this investment under the equity method. The acquisition
was recorded under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase cost was
allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the fair value
as of the closing date.

    Set forth below is the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements
of operations data for the Company for the year ended December 31, 1998 as if
the acquisition of the Kings Plaza Mall and the related financing transactions
had occurred on January 1, 1997.

          (1)  At December 31, 2000, the Company is indebted to Vornado in the
               amount of $115,000,000 comprised of (i) $95,000,000 relating to
               the subordinated tranche of a $115,000,000 secured financing and
               (ii) $20,000,000 under the line of credit discussed below.

               On August 1, 2000, the Company obtained a $50,000,000 secured
               line of credit from Vornado under the same terms and conditions
               as the existing $95,000,000 loan from Vornado, including the
               interest rate of 15.72%. The maturity date of the existing
               $95,000,000 loan has been extended to March 15, 2002, which is
               also the maturity date of the new line of credit. The interest
               rate on the loan and line of credit will reset on March 15, 2001,
               using the same spread to treasuries as presently exists. The
               proceeds of the secured line of credit are being used for general
               corporate purposes including continuing to fund the real estate
               development costs at its Lexington Avenue property.

               The interest rate on the bank loan is LIBOR plus 1.85% (8.56% at
               December 31, 2000). The term loan to the bank which was scheduled
               to mature on March 15, 2001, has been extended to March 15, 2002.
               In addition, the interest rate will reset on March 15, 2001 using
               the same spread to LIBOR as presently exists.

               The loans are secured by liens on all of the Company's assets
               and/or pledges of the stock of subsidiaries owning the assets
               and/or guarantees of such subsidiaries and the parent. The liens
               do not cover the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center and Rego
               Park I and are subordinate to first mortgages. The Vornado lien
               is subordinate to the bank's. The Vornado loan is prepayable
               quarterly without penalty. Under the terms of the loans, no
               dividends can be paid unless required to maintain REIT status.

          (2)  The Company's mortgage loan, which is an obligation of a
               wholly-owned subsidiary, matures on June 1, 2001 and is secured
               by a mortgage on the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center and
               guaranteed by the Company. The loan bears interests at LIBOR plus
               1.25% (8.06% at December 31, 2000).

          (3)  The Company's mortgage loan, which is an obligation of a
               wholly-owned subsidiary, matures in May, 2009 and is secured by a
               mortgage on the Rego Park I property and guaranteed by the
               Company. The loan bears interests at 7.25%. Amortization of
               principal begins in July 2004 on a 30-year schedule.

          (4)  The Company's $21,263,000, an obligation of a wholly-owned
               subsidiary of the Company collateralized by the Fordham Road
               property, was scheduled to mature on February 24, 2000. The
               mortgage loan was extended for an additional three-years to April
               17, 2003. Under the terms of the extension, interest accrues at
               LIBOR plus 1.50% in the first two years and LIBOR plus 1.75% in
               year three which is a reduction of the original terms of LIBOR
               plus 4.25%. (8.30% at December 31, 2000) interest is payable at
               LIBOR for the entire term. The spread over LIBOR accrues during
               the extended term and increases the principal balance. This
               obligation has been satisfied in connection with the sale of the
               Fordham Road property on January 12, 2001. See "Subsequent
               Event."

          (5)  The note is secured by a third mortgage on the Lexington Avenue
               property. The note bears annual interest at Prime plus 1% (10.50%
               at December 31, 2000) and is prepayable without penalty.

      A summary of maturities of debt at December 31, 2000, is as follows:

</TABLE>

(A)      $114,525,000 of this amount relates to a first mortgage loan secured by
         the Company's Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center (the "Center"). The
         Company is currently negotiating refinancing the Center with various
         outside lenders. Based on the historical operating performance of the
         Center, management believes that it has excess borrowing capacity over
         the existing mortgage loan. The remaining $20,000,000 is a term loan to
         a bank which was scheduled to mature on March 15, 2001. This loan has
         been extended to March 15, 2002.

(B)      $21,263,000 of this amount was repaid on January 12, 2001 in connection
         with the sale of the Fordham Road property.

    All of the Company's debt is secured by mortgages and/or pledges of the
stock of subsidiaries holding the properties. The net carrying value of real
estate collateralizing the debt amounted to $346,051,000 at December 31, 2000.

5.  LEASES

As Lessor

      The Company leases properties to tenants. The rental terms for the
properties leased range from 5 years to approximately 30 years. The leases
provide for the payment of fixed base rentals payable monthly in advance and for
the payment by the lessees of additional rents based on a percentage of the
tenants' sales as well as reimbursements of real estate taxes, insurance and
maintenance.

      Future base rental revenue under these noncancellable operating leases is
as follows:

</TABLE>

      Included in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 is
$4,877,000 resulting from the write-off of the asset arising from the
straight-line of rents primarily as a result of Caldor's rejection of its
Flushing lease in 1999.

      Sears accounted for 21%, 22% and 28% of the Company's consolidated
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. No
other tenant accounted for more than 10% of revenues

6.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     Steven Roth is Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company, the
Managing General Partner of Interstate Properties ("Interstate") and Chairman of
the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Vornado. At December 31, 2000, Mr.
Roth, Interstate and the other two general partners of Interstate, David
Mandelbaum and Russell B. Wight, Jr. (who are also directors of the Company and
trustees of Vorndao) own, in the aggregate, 27.5% of the outstanding common
stock of the Company, and 17.7% of the outstanding common shares of beneficial
interest of Vornado.

     The Company is managed by and its properties are redeveloped and leased by
Vornado, pursuant to agreements with a one-year term expiring in March of each
year which are automatically renewable.

     The annual management fee payable by the Company to Vornado is equal to the
sum of (i) $3,000,000, (ii) 3% of the gross income from the Kings Plaza Mall,
plus (iii) 6% of development costs with minimum guaranteed fees of $750,000 per
annum. The leasing agreement provides for the Company to pay a fee to Vornado
equal to (i) 3% of the gross proceeds, as defined, from the sale of an asset,
and (ii) in the event of a lease or sublease of an asset, 3% of lease rent for
the first ten years of a lease term, 2% of lease rent for the eleventh through
the twentieth years of a lease term and 1% of lease rent for the twenty-first
through thirtieth year of a lease term, subject to the payment of rents by
tenants. Such amount is payable annually in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000,
until the present value of such installments (calculated at a discount rate of
9% per annum) equals the amount that would have been paid had it been paid on
September 21, 1993, or at the time the transactions which gave rise to the
Commissions occurred, if later. At December 31, 2000 the Company does not owe
Vornado any leasing fees. Pursuant to the leasing agreement, in the event third
party real estate brokers are used, the fees to Vornado increase by 1% and
Vornado is responsible for the fees to the third party real estate brokers.

                       ALEXANDER'S, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


     The Company owes Vornado $115,000,000. The Company incurred interest on the
loan of $15,934,000, $7,857,000 and $6,486,000 for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998.

7.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     The Company let contracts for $28,000,000 to undertake the excavation,
clearing and preparation of the Lexington Avenue property for the proposed
development of a large multi-use building. As of December 31, 2000, $26,839,000
has been paid.

      In June 1997, the Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center (the "Center"),
commissioned an Environmental Study and Contamination Assessment Site
Investigation (the Phase II "Study") to evaluate and delineate environmental
conditions disclosed in a Phase I study. The results of the Study indicate the
presence of petroleum and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate contamination in the soil
and groundwater. The Company has delineated the contamination and has developed
a remediation approach. The New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation ("NYDEC") has not yet approved the remediation approach. The
Company accrued $2,000,000 in previous years ($1,678,000 has been paid as of
December 31, 2000) for its estimated obligation with respect to the clean up of
the site, which includes costs of (i) remedial investigation, (ii) feasibility
study, (iii) remedial design, (iv) remedial action and (v) professional fees. If
the NYDEC insists on a more extensive remediation approach, the Company could
incur additional obligations.

      The majority of the contamination may have resulted from activities of
third parties; however, the sources of the contamination have not been fully
identified. Although the Company intends to pursue all available remedies
against any potentially responsible third parties, there can be no assurance
that such parties will be identified, or if identified, whether these
potentially responsible third parties will be solvent. In addition, the costs
associated with pursuing any potentially responsible parties may be cost
prohibitive. The Company has not recorded an asset as of December 31, 2000 for
potential recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties.

     Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, nor is their
property the subject of, any material pending legal proceeding other than
routine litigation incidental to their businesses. The Company believes that
these legal actions will not be material to the Company's financial condition or
results of operations

     Letters of Credit

     Approximately $900,000 in standby letters of credit were issued at December
31, 2000.

8.   STOCK OPTION PLAN

     Under the Omnibus Stock Plan (the "Plan"), approved by the Company's
stockholders on May 22, 1996, directors, officers, key employees, employees of
Vornado Realty Trust and any other person or entity as designated by the Omnibus
Stock Plan Committee are eligible to be granted incentive share options and
non-qualified options to purchase common shares. Options granted are at prices
equal to 100% of the market price of the Company's shares at the date of grant,
vest on a graduated basis, becoming fully vested 36 months after grant and
expire ten years after grant. The Plan also provides for the award of Stock
Appreciation Rights, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock, as defined.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


     On June 5, 2000, the Board of Directors approved the conversion of 850,000
stock options of two officers/directors into equivalent stock appreciation
rights (SARs). The SARs have the same vesting terms and strike prices as the
options. Accounting for SARs is reflected in the statement of operations,
whereas the accounting for stock options is not. Since the stock price at
December 31, 2000 is less than the strike price, no expense is included in the
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. SARs, unlike
options, are not aggregated under the REIT rules.

         The Company sold its Fordham Road Property, located in the Bronx, New
York, on January 12, 2001. The vacant property contains 303,000 square feet and
was sold for $25,500,000 resulting in a gain of $19,100,000. In addition, the

an extraordinary gain from the early extinguishment of debt of $3,500,000.
Included in the expenses relating to the sale, the Company paid a commission of
$1,020,000 of which $520,000 was paid to Vornado. These transactions will be
recorded in the first quarter of 2001.

(1)  The loans, which were scheduled to mature in March 2001, have been extended
     to March 2002. The loans are secured by liens on all of the Company's
     assets and/or pledges of the stock of subsidiaries owning the assets and/or
     guarantees of such subsidiaries and the parent, except for the Kings Plaza
     Regional Shopping Center and Rego Park I. These liens are subordinate to
     first mortgages.

(2)  Initial cost is as of May 15, 1992 (the date on which the Company commenced
     real estate operations) unless acquired subsequent to that date. See Column
     J.

(3)  The net basis in the Company's assets and liabilities for tax purposes is
     approximately $84,000,000 lower than the amount reported for financial
     statement purposes.

(4)  Date represents lease acquisition date.

(5)  The Fordham Road property was sold on January 12, 2001 and the related
     encumbrance was satisfied. At December 31, 2000 such property was
     classified as "asset held for sale."
