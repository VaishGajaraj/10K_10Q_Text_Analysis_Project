PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
     Hathaway Corporation (the Company) was organized under the laws of Colorado
     in 1962. The Company is engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing
     and selling advanced systems and instrumentation to the worldwide power and
     process industries, as well as motion control products to a broad spectrum
     of customers throughout the world. The Company operates primarily in the
     United States and the United Kingdom and has three joint venture
     investments in China.

     POWER AND PROCESS BUSINESS
     POWER INSTRUMENTATION
     Hathaway's power instrumentation products helps ensure that electric
     utilities provide high quality service to consumers of electricity. With
     manufacturing facilities in Seattle and Belfast, Northern Ireland, and
     sales and engineering functions in Seattle, Belfast and Denver, the power
     products group produces a comprehensive and cost-effective range of
     products designed exclusively for the power industry worldwide. Hathaway's
     equipment assists the electric power system operators in operating and
     maintaining proper system performance. The products, which are used to
     monitor and control the power generation, transmission and distribution
     processes, include fault recording products, fault location products,
     condition monitoring (circuit breaker) products and remote terminal units
     for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.

     The Company also has three joint venture investments in China - Hathaway Si
     Fang Protection and Control Company (Si Fang), Zibo Kehui Electric Company
     Ltd. (Kehui) and Hathaway Power Monitoring Systems Company, Ltd. (HPMS).
     The Company holds a 20% interest in Si Fang, a 25% interest in Kehui and a
     40% interest in HPMS. Si Fang designs, manufactures and sells a new
     generation of digital protective relays, control equipment and
     instrumentation products for substations in power transmission and
     distribution systems in China and is now the largest Chinese supplier of
     digital relays in China. The Company may sell these products outside of
     China. Kehui designs, manufactures and sells cable and overhead fault
     location products, SCADA systems and other test instruments within the
     China market and the Company may sell these products outside of China. HPMS
     manufactures and sells, under a license from the Company, instrumentation
     products designed by the Company to electric power companies in China.

     PROCESS INSTRUMENTATION
     The process instrumentation products group manufactures and markets
     products for the process and power industries including monitoring systems,
     calibration equipment and process measurement instrumentation. The
     monitoring systems, called visual annunciators and sequential event
     recorders, provide both visual and audible alarms and are used to control
     processes in various plants, including chemical, petroleum, food and
     beverage, pulp and paper, and textiles. Calibration equipment is used to
     test and adjust instrumentation for proper and accurate operation in
     measuring electricity, temperatures and pressure within the process
     industry. Process measurement instrumentation includes signal conditioning
     products and transducers used to measure such variables as temperature,
     voltage, current and power in various industrial applications.

     SYSTEMS AUTOMATION
     Effective September 30, 1996, the Company acquired Tate Integrated Systems
     ("TIS") which has since operated under the ownership of Hathaway Industrial
     Automation (HIA), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. HIA is located
     near Baltimore, Maryland and is a full service supplier of process
     automation systems for industrial applications. HIA has developed a
     state-of-the-art software system for Supervisory Control and Data
     Acquisition (SCADA) and Distributed Control Systems (DCS). The HIA system
     has been used to fully automate such industrial applications as water and
     wastewater treatment plants, glass manufacturing plants, oil and gas
     terminals and tank farm facilities. In addition to expanding into its
     traditional process markets, HIA's system is being marketed to the power
     utility industry that is beginning to operate in a deregulated environment.
     The Company has been successful at integrating the HIA system with certain
     other Hathaway products and targeting the integrated product at substation
     automation and integration applications used in power transmission and
     distribution facilities. The automation system allows for the measurement,
     control and communication of information including the data for the
     metering of electricity to ensure the reliable delivery of power, provide
     data privacy and to control security.

     MOTION CONTROL BUSINESS
     The motion control group offers quality, cost-effective products that suit
     a wide range of applications in the telecommunications, semi-conductor
     processing, industrial, medical, military and aerospace industries, as well
     as in manufacturing of analytical instruments and computer peripherals. The
     end products using Hathaway technology include tuneable lasers, wavelength
     meters, spectrum analyzers, special industrial and technical products such
     as satellite tracking systems, MRI scanners, and high definition printers.

     The motion control group is organized into one division and two
     subsidiaries, respectively, of Hathaway Motion Control Corporation, a
     wholly owned subsidiary of the Company: Motors and Instruments Division
     (MI - Tulsa), Emoteq Corporation (Emoteq - Tulsa) and Computer Optical
     Products, Inc. (COPI - Chatsworth, CA).

     Effective July 1, 1998, Emoteq Corporation acquired all of the outstanding
     shares of Ashurst Logistic Electronics Limited of Bournemouth, England
     (Ashurst) for $317,000. Ashurst manufactures drive electronics and position
     controllers for a variety of motor technologies as well as a family of
     static frequency converters for military and aerospace applications and has
     extensive experience in power electronics design and software development
     required for the application of specialized drive electronics technology.
     The acquired company was renamed Emoteq UK Limited.

     The MI division manufactures precision direct-current fractional horsepower
     motors and certain motor components. Industrial equipment and military
     products are the major application for the motors. This division also
     supplies spare parts and replacement equipment for general-purpose
     instrumentation products.

     Emoteq designs, manufactures and markets direct current brushless motors,
     related components, and drive and control electronics. Markets served
     include semiconductor manufacturing, industrial automation, medical
     equipment, and military and aerospace. A new motion technology center was
     established in Evergreen, Colorado in fiscal year 1998 to develop more
     automated methods of manufacturing and advance the state of Emoteq's core
     technology base.

     Optical encoders are manufactured by COPI. They are used to measure
     rotational and linear movements of parts in diverse applications such as
     tuneable lasers, spectrum analyzers, machine tools, robots, printers and
     medical equipment. The primary markets for the optical encoders are in the
     telecommunications, computer peripheral manufacturing, industrial and
     medical sectors. COPI also designs, manufactures and markets fiber
     optic-based encoders with special characteristics, such as immunity to
     radio frequency interference and high temperature tolerance, suited for
     industrial, aerospace and military environments. Applications include
     airborne navigational systems, anti-lock braking transducers, missile
     flight surface controls and high temperature process control equipment.

     PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION AND PRINCIPAL MARKETS
     The Company maintains a direct sales force. In addition to its own
     marketing and sales force, the Company has developed a worldwide network of
     independent sales representatives and agents to market its various product
     lines.

     The Company faces competition in all of its markets, although the number of
     competitors varies depending upon the product. The Company believes there
     are only a small number of competitors in the power and process markets,
     but there are numerous competitors in the motion control market. No clear
     market share data is available for the Company's other product areas.
     Competition involves primarily product performance and price, although
     service and warranty are also important.

     FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATING SEGMENTS
     The information required by this item is set forth in Note 9 of the Notes
     to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 30 herein.

     AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
     All parts and materials used by the company are in adequate supply. No
     significant parts or materials are acquired from a single source.


                                       2
<PAGE>

     PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, FRANCHISES, AND CONCESSIONS
     The Company holds several patents and trademarks regarding components used
     by the various subsidiaries; however, none of these patents and trademarks
     are considered to be of major significance.

     SEASONALITY OF THE BUSINESS
     The Company's business is not of a seasonal nature; however, revenues
     derived from the power market may be influenced by customers' fiscal year
     ends and holiday seasons.

     WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS
     The Company currently maintains inventory levels adequate for its
     short-term needs based upon present levels of production. The Company
     considers the component parts of its different product lines to be readily
     available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying
     anticipated needs.

     SALES TO LARGE CUSTOMERS
     During fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 no single customer accounted for more
     than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenue from continuing operations.

     SALES BACKLOG
     The Company's backlog at June 30, 2000 consisted of sales orders totaling
     approximately $23,827,000. The Company expects to ship goods filling
     $20,912,000 of those purchase orders within fiscal 2001. This compares to a
     backlog of $18,260,000 at June 30, 1999, of which $16,128,000 was scheduled
     for shipment in fiscal 2000.

     GOVERNMENT SALES
     Approximately $181,000 of the Company's backlog as of June 30, 2000
     consisted of contracts with the United States Government. The Company's
     contracts with the government contain a provision generally found in
     government contracts which permits the government to terminate the contract
     at its option. When the termination is attributable to no fault of the
     Company, the government would, in general, have to pay the Company certain
     allowable costs up to the time of termination, but there is no compensation
     for loss of profits.

     ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
     The Company's expenditures on engineering and development were $4,274,000
     in fiscal 2000, $4,466,000 in fiscal 1999 and $4,411,000 in fiscal 1998. Of
     these expenditures, no material amounts were charged directly to customers.

     ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
     No significant pollution or other types of emission result from the
     Company's operations and it is not anticipated that the Company's proposed
     operations will be affected by Federal, State or local provisions
     concerning environmental controls. However, there can be no assurance that
     any future regulations will not affect the Company's operations.

     FOREIGN OPERATIONS
     The information required by this item is set forth in Note 9 of the Notes
     to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 32 herein.

     EMPLOYEES
     As of the end of fiscal 2000, the Company had approximately 374 full-time
     employees.

OPERATING RESULTS
FISCAL YEAR 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 1999
The Company recorded net income of $1,475,000 in fiscal year 2000, compared
to a net loss of $1,525,000 in fiscal 1999. Revenues increased 8% from
$41,691,000, in fiscal 1999 to $45,133,000 in fiscal 2000. The increase in
revenues was due to a 43.2% increase in revenues from the Company's motion
control products, partially offset by a 7.6% decrease in revenues from the
Company's power and process systems and instrumentation products.

The increase in Motion Control revenues was primarily due to expansion into new
high growth applications such as test instrumentation for the fiberoptic
telecommunications industry as well as the expansion of existing applications.
At June 30, 2000 backlog for Motion Control orders was in excess of $12 million,
69% higher than at June 30, 1999. This is a reflection of Motion Control's
continued expansion into new markets and broader segments of its existing
markets. The increased order rate and backlog indicate that the segment should
continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability in fiscal year 2001.

The decrease in Power and Process revenues was due to a decline in orders and
sales from the process instrumentation business partially as a result of the
Company's delay in releasing a new calibration product line which has now been
completed and shipments started in May 2000. In addition, the decline was
partially due to higher sales being achieved in fiscal year 1999 from customers
purchasing upgrade products to comply with Year 2000 requirements which reduced
their funds available for projects in our fiscal year 2000. At June 30, 2000
backlog for Power and Process orders was $11,522,000 which was 5% higher than at
the end of the previous year. This reflects higher backlog for power
instrumentation and systems automation products partially offset by a decreased
backlog for process instrumentation products.

Sales to international customers decreased 9% from $12,902,000, or 31% of sales,
in fiscal 1999, to $11,779,000 or 26% of sales, in fiscal 2000 due to a decrease
in sales of fault recording and maintenance products in foreign markets.

Sales order backlog increased 30% from $18,260,000 at June 30, 1999 to
$23,827,000 at June 30, 2000. Cost of products sold decreased 2% from 64% of
revenues in fiscal 1999 to 62% of revenues in fiscal 2000 due to increased sales
volume and changes in the mix of products sold.

Selling expenses decreased 6% from $6,852,000 in fiscal 1999 to $6,433,000 in
fiscal 2000 resulting from savings due to the continued overall cost reduction
efforts of the Company. General and administrative expenses increased 5% from
$4,958,000 in fiscal 1999 to $5,194,000 in fiscal 2000 primarily due to bonuses
paid to the management of profitable operations. Engineering and development
expenses decreased 4% from $4,466,000 in 1999 to $4,274,000 in 2000.

Amortization of intangibles and other assets decreased from $481,000 in 1999 to
$83,000 in 2000. The decrease was primarily due to the $125,000 of amortization
and $249,000 write off in fiscal 1999 of the goodwill from the 1991 acquisition
of Hathaway Systems Limited (HSL). This goodwill was fully written off in fiscal
1999.

The Company also has three joint venture investments in China - Hathaway Si Fang
Protection and Control Company (Si Fang), Zibo Kehui Electric Company Ltd.
(Kehui) and Hathaway Power Monitoring Systems Company, Ltd. (HPMS). The Company
holds a 20% interest in Si Fang, a 25% interest in Kehui and a 40% interest in
HPMS. Si Fang designs, manufactures and sells a new generation of digital
protective relays, control equipment and instrumentation products for
substations in power transmission and distribution systems in China and is now
the largest Chinese supplier of digital relays in China. The Company may sell
these products outside of China. Kehui designs, manufactures and sells cable and
overhead fault location products, SCADA systems and other test instruments
within the China market and the Company may sell these products outside of
China. HPMS manufactures and sells, under a license from the Company,
instrumentation products designed by the Company to electric power companies in
China.

 During fiscal 2000 the Company sold a portion of its investment in its Si Fang
joint venture to another partner, reducing its ownership from 23% to 20%. The
Company received $143,000 and recognized a $126,000 gain on the sale. The gain
is included in other income in the consolidated statement of operations. The
Company reinvested the proceeds from the sale plus an additional $283,000 in
cash to maintain this 20% ownership interest. During fiscal


                                       6
<PAGE>

2000, the Company received $139,000 in cash dividends from this joint venture.
The Company has no future commitments relating to its Chinese investments.

The Company accounts for the Chinese joint ventures using the equity method of
accounting. At the time of the original investments in the Chinese joint
ventures and until the beginning of fiscal 1998, the Company determined that due
to the start-up nature of the entities, their untested products and political
uncertainty in China, the realization of the initial investments and subsequent
earnings (which were not significant) was uncertain; and, therefore, the Company
fully reserved against the original investments and its share of any equity in
income.

Beginning in fiscal year 1998 and continuing during fiscal years 1999 and 2000,
Si Fang and Kehui's operations matured, their products have gained significant
acceptance and both companies have achieved sustained profitability. Because of
the sustained positive operating results, offset by a certain amount of
political and business uncertainty in China, the Company recognized a portion of
its share of equity income from these two joint ventures, totaling $698,000 and
$329,000 in fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively. These amounts are included
in equity income from investments in joint ventures in the consolidated
statements of operations. The amounts recognized represent management's best
estimate of the future amounts that will be realized from the joint ventures as
of June 30, 2000. The Company will continue to recognize its share of equity in
income (loss) from these two joint ventures to the extent it believes such
amounts are realizable.

The Company acquired Tate Integrated Systems (TIS) effective September 30, 1996.
TIS has operated under the ownership of Hathaway Industrial Automation (HIA), a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, since October 1, 1996. HIA is a full
service supplier of process automation systems for industrial applications. HIA
has developed a state-of-the-art software system for Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Distributed Control Systems (DCS). The HIA system
has been used to fully automate such industrial applications as water and
wastewater treatment plants, glass manufacturing plants, oil and gas terminals
and tank farm facilities. In addition to expanding into its traditional process
markets, HIA's system is being marketed to the deregulated power utility
industry. The Company has been successful at integrating the HIA system with
certain other Hathaway products and targeting the integrated product at
substation automation and integration applications used in the generation,
transmission and distribution of power. The automation system allows for the
measurement, control and communication of information including data for the
metering of electricity to ensure the reliable delivery of power, provide data
privacy and to control security.

For the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, HIA had losses before income
taxes of approximately $871,000, $1.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively.
HIA's traditional business is highly dependent on sales to the industrial market
which typically encompasses a long sales cycle, significant customization to
specific customer requirements, long performance periods and large contract
values which are subject to a high degree of scrutiny and negotiation with
customers.

Consistent with the Company's strategy to develop applications for the HIA
software for the deregulated power industry, the Company has continued to invest
substantial resources in HIA. HIA's system is now successfully installed at
generator sites in California and as part of pilot projects for several power
companies where the system has been installed for evaluation in both
transmission substations and generating plants. The Company also has a contract
to install the technology at over eighty generating plants that supply electric
power to the New England area. The systems are designed to adapt to the power
industry's future needs by allowing for the addition of future enhancements and
systems capabilities.

Management believes that the software products developed by HIA, as modified for
the power industry and combined with other Company products, will provide power
companies with automated and integrated systems solutions that will both reduce
their operating costs and improve the reliability of their power supply.
However, there can be no assurance that such modifications will be successful
and/or economically viable. Management believes that there is significant demand
in the power industry for such solutions as a result of the business environment
created by the recent industry deregulation.

The successful implementation of the Company's current business plan continues
to be partially dependent on the Company's ability to successfully market HIA's
products to the deregulated power industry. The factors that will affect the
success of implementing this business plan include, but are not limited to, the
ability to win sufficient amount of project work on favorable terms to the
Company, the ability to complete projects in a timely and cost-


                                       7
<PAGE>

effective manner, and the existence of sufficient demand for the HIA
products. An inability to achieve this plan in the planned timeframe may have
a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial
condition.

In fiscal year 2000 the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of
$129,000 compared to $208,000 in fiscal year 1999. The effective tax rate as a
percentage of the income or loss before income taxes was a provision of 8% in
fiscal 2000 and 16% in fiscal 1999. The difference is primarily due to the
change in the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset. In
year fiscal 2000, the valuation allowance was decreased due to the utilization
of net operating loss carryforwards, whereas in fiscal year 1999, the valuation
allowance was increased due to the increase in net operating losses being
carried forward. The difference is also due to a decrease in nondeductible
expenses and goodwill amortization. Realization of the Company's remaining net
deferred tax asset is dependent upon the Company generating sufficient taxable
income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible
temporary differences and the remaining net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. The Company's management believes that, on a more likely than not
basis, the recorded net deferred tax asset is realizable. The amount of deferred
tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if
estimates of future taxable income are changed.

FISCAL YEAR 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 1998
The Company recorded a net loss of $1,525,000 in fiscal year 1999, compared to a
net loss of $1,977,000 in fiscal 1998. Revenues increased 1% from $41,317,000,
in fiscal 1998 to $41,691,000 in fiscal 1999. The increase in revenues was due
to a 4.5% increase in revenues from the Company's power and process
instrumentation products partially offset by a 6.2% decrease in revenues from
the Company's motion control products. The decrease in Motion Control revenues
was primarily due to decreased orders as a result of the Asian economic crises
and the slowdown in the semi-conductor industry partially offset by the addition
of revenues from Emoteq UK. Motion Control orders, however, increased over the
prior year, with the order rate progressively increasing over the last three
quarters of fiscal 1999. At June 30, 1999 backlog for Motion Control orders was
24% higher than at June 30, 1998. This is a reflection of Motion Control's
expansion into new markets and broader segments of its existing markets.

Sales to international customers decreased 8% from $13,955,000, or 34% of sales,
in fiscal 1998, to $12,902,000, or 31% of sales, in fiscal 1999. Sales order
backlog increased 31% from $13,892,000 at June 30, 1998 to $18,260,000 at June
30, 1999. Cost of products sold remained at 64% of revenues in fiscal 1998 and
1999.

Selling expenses decreased 11% from $7,697,000 in fiscal 1998 to $6,852,000 in
fiscal 1999 resulting from savings due to the overall cost reduction efforts of
the Company as well as from HIA's change in its primary focus to the deregulated
power industry in 1999 from industrial markets in previous periods. General and
administrative expenses increased 14% from $4,358,000 in fiscal 1998 to
$4,958,000 in fiscal 1999 primarily due to bonuses paid to the management of
profitable operations and the addition of Emoteq UK. Engineering and development
expenses increased 1% from $4,411,000 in 1998 to $4,466,000 in 1999.

Amortization of intangibles and other assets decreased from $738,000 in 1998 to
$481,000 in 1999. The decrease was primarily due to the $406,000 impairment
write-off in fiscal 1998 of the unamortized portion of goodwill which resulted
from the HIA acquisition, partially offset by the $249,000 impairment write-off
in fiscal 1999 of the unamortized portion of goodwill from the 1991 acquisition
of Hathaway Systems Limited (HSL), and fiscal 1999 amortization expense related
to the Ashurst acquisition. (See further discussion under "Business Acquisition"
below.)

As a result of its acquisition of HSL, the Company had previously recorded
goodwill of $1,197,000. At June 30, 1999 and in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of" (SFAS No. 121),
the Company determined that the unamortized cost in excess of net assets
acquired from its acquisition of HSL was impaired; and, therefore, wrote-off the
remaining unamortized balance of $249,000. The Company's determination was based
on projections of undiscounted cash flows of HSL, which were based on current
marketplace conditions, low orders and continuing losses. Such undiscounted cash
flow estimates were not sufficient to indicate realization of the related
unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired. Utilizing such projections
and discounting the estimated cash flows, the Company determined that the entire
unamortized amount was impaired. The current year amortization of $125,000


                                       8
<PAGE>

and impairment write-off of $249,000, totaling $374,000, is included in
amortization of intangibles and other in the fiscal year 1999 consolidated
statement of operations.

The Company recognized a portion of its share of equity income from Kehui and Si
Fang, two of its joint venture investments in China, totaling $329,000 and
$222,000 in fiscal years 1999 and 1998, respectively. These amounts are included
in equity income from investments in joint ventures in the consolidated
statements of operations.

During fiscal 1999, the Company sold 2% of its investment in Si Fang for $57,000
in cash and recognized a $49,000 gain on the sale, which is included in other
income in the accompanying statement of operations. The Company also invested an
additional $92,000 in the joint venture and received $121,000 cash dividends
during the fiscal year. At June 30, 1999, the Company has recorded a net
investment in Si Fang and Kehui of $467,000 and $47,000, respectively, which is
included in investment in joint ventures, net in the consolidated balance
sheets.

Prior to June 30, 1999, the Company also had an 11.4% interest in a joint
venture (JV) with KUB Holdings BHD, a Malaysian firm, acquired from TIS, which
had a carrying value of $0. The JV was created for the purpose of marketing and
selling the TIS-4000 system of HIA in certain Asian countries. As of June 30,
1998, the JV had ceased all operations due to unprofitability and the Asian
economic downturn. During fiscal year 1999, the JV was dissolved and settled its
existing obligations from its existing assets. The license to manufacture,
market and sell the TIS-4000 system reverted back to the Company and the Company
has no further obligations related to this JV.

In fiscal year 1999 the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of
$208,000 compared to a benefit of $184,000 in fiscal year 1998. The effective
tax rate was a provision of 16% in fiscal 1999 and a benefit of 9% in fiscal
1998. The difference is primarily due to a decrease in nondeductible expenses
and goodwill amortization plus an increase in the valuation allowance against
the deferred tax asset. The increase is also due to income taxes payable in
local tax jurisdictions where the Company has no net operating losses. The
valuation allowance was increased primarily due to the increased level of net
operating losses being carried forward and the Company's continued operating
losses. Realization of the Company's net deferred tax asset is dependent upon
the Company generating sufficient United States federal taxable income
(approximately $1,859,000) in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal
of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and net operating
loss carryforwards. The Company's management believes that, on a more likely
than not basis, the recorded net deferred tax asset is realizable. The amount of
deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future
periods if estimates of future United States federal taxable income are changed.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION
Effective July 1, 1998, Emoteq Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, acquired all the outstanding shares of Ashurst Logistic Electronics
Limited of Bournemouth, England (Ashurst) for $281,000 in cash, net of cash
acquired. Ashurst manufactures drive electronics and position controllers for a
variety of motor technologies as well as a family of static frequency converters
for military and aerospace applications and has extensive experience in power
electronics design and software development required for the application of
specialized drive electronics technology. The acquired company was renamed
Emoteq UK Limited. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting, and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to
the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair
values at the date of acquisition.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents
(excluding restricted cash) increased $512,000 during the year to a balance
of $2,928,000 at June 30, 2000. Fiscal 2000 operating activities generated
$678,000, compared to $81,000 used in fiscal 1999 and $1,450,000 generated in
1998. The amounts used to fund the operations of the HIA business in 2000,
1999 and 1998 was $1,052,000, $1,379,000 and $1,628,000, respectively, while
the amounts generated from the operating activities of the Company's other
businesses was $1,730,000, $1,298,000 and $3,078,000, respectively, for the
same periods. The increased cash generated from operations during 1998 was
primarily due to income tax refunds received.

Cash of $970,000, $987,000 and $914,000 was used by investing activities in
fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The 2000 cash used for investing
activities includes $143,000 net cash used in investments in joint ventures. The
1999 cash used for investing activities includes $281,000 net cash paid for the
interest acquired in Ashurst. The 1998 cash used for investing activities
includes $229,000 paid for the interest acquired in TIS.

Financing activities generated $809,000 and $63,000 in fiscal years 2000 and
1999, respectively, and used $526,000 in fiscal year 1998. The increase in cash
generated from financing activities in 2000 was due to proceeds from the
exercise of employee stock options, as well as increased net borrowings on the
line-of-credit. The increased cash used in financing activities in 1998 was due
to repayments, net of borrowings, on the line-of-credit of $524,000.

At June 30, 2000, the Company had $1,546,000 of bank debt, compared with
$1,308,000 at June 30, 1999, an increase of $238,000. The debt at June 30, 2000
represents borrowings on the Company's current long-term financing agreement
(Agreement) with Silicon Valley Bank (Silicon). The Agreement matures on May 7,
2001 and, accordingly, the $1,546,000 balance has been classified as a current
liability as of June 30, 2000. The Agreement is subject to automatic and
continuous annual renewal for successive additional terms of one year each
unless either party notifies the other of its intention to terminate the
Agreement at least sixty days before the next maturity date. Borrowings on the
loan are restricted to the lesser of $3,000,000 or 85% of the Company's eligible
receivables (Maximum Credit Limit). As of June 30, 2000, 85% of the Company's
eligible receivables exceeded the maximum loan amount, therefore, the Company
could borrow an additional $1,454,000 up to the Maximum Credit Limit of
$3,000,000.

The loan bears interest at Silicon's prime borrowing rate (prime rate, 9.5% at
June 30, 2000) plus 2%. The interest rate is adjustable on a quarterly basis to
prime rate plus 1.5% if the Company achieves a net loss less than $750,000 for
each previous twelve-month rolling period. The Company must continue to meet
this quarterly financial goal, or the rate will be re-adjusted to prime rate
plus 2%. In addition to interest, the loan bears a monthly unused line fee at
0.125% of the Maximum Credit Limit less the average daily balance of the
outstanding loan during a month. The unused line fee is also adjustable on a
quarterly basis, if the Company achieves a net loss less than $750,000 for each
previous twelve-month rolling period, the monthly unused line fee will be
adjusted to 0.0625%. The Company must continue to meet this quarterly financial
goal, or the rate will be re-adjusted to 0.125%. The Company qualified for the
lower interest rate and unused line fee beginning January 1, 2000.

The debt is secured by all assets of the Company. The Agreement requires that
the Company maintain compliance with certain covenants related to tangible net
worth. At June 30, 2000, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.

As in the three-year period ended June 30, 2000, the Company's fiscal 2001
working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements are expected
to be funded from cash provided by operations, the existing cash balance of
$2,928,000 and the $1,454,000 available under the long-term financing agreement
at June 30, 2000. The Company believes that such amounts are sufficient to fund
operations and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. As
explained above, the Company's Agreement with Silicon matures on May 7, 2001 but
will continue for successive additional terms of one each year unless either
party gives notice of termination at least sixty days before the maturity date.
The Company has not received notice of termination and does not anticipate
receiving or giving such notice.

In June 1998, the Company filed a request for an income tax ruling by the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to the tax-free treatment of the
possible spin-off of its Power and Process Business from its Motion Control
Business. In December 1998, the IRS issued a favorable ruling on the proposed
transaction; however, because of the downturn in results of the Motion Control
business in fiscal 1999 and losses being incurred by the Power and Process
business, the Company did not believe it was prudent to proceed with the
spin-off. The Company will continue to explore opportunities for increasing
shareholder value that could include consideration of a spin-off of the Power
and Process Business as well as other alternatives.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE
In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted a "Y2K Readiness Program" and prepared for
Year 2000 effects on the proper functioning of computer systems included in its
products, software systems used in its business and items purchased from its
suppliers. The Company has not experienced, and does not anticipate experiencing
in the future any Year 2000 related failures in its products. In addition there
was no interruption in or failure of normal business activities or operations
due to Year 2000 failures experienced in its internal systems, processes and
facilities or from its key vendors, suppliers or subcontractors nor are any
anticipated in the future.


                                       10
<PAGE>

The Company's activities related to Year 2000 compliance were performed with
internal resources. All payroll and associated costs related to the Year 2000
issue were expensed as incurred. Year 2000 activities did not delay other
projects or materially impact the Company's business however, certain customers
may have deferred purchases of certain power products due to their own Year 2000
concerns. With the Year 2000 rollover completed, the Company believes it
obtained any such deferred sales during fiscal 2000. The Company will continue
to monitor whether it needs to further address any anticipated costs, problems
and uncertainties associated with Year 2000 consequences.

PRICE LEVELS AND THE IMPACT OF INFLATION
Prices of the Company's products have not increased significantly as a result
of inflation during the past several years, primarily due to competition. The
effect of inflation on the Company's costs of production has been minimized
through production efficiencies and lower costs of materials. The Company
anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any
foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which
it operates. As the Company's manufacturing activities mainly utilize
semi-skilled labor, which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding
the Company's production facilities, the Company does not anticipate
substantial inflation-related increases in the wages of the majority of its
employees.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Company due to adverse changes in
financial and commodity market prices and rates. The Company is exposed to
market risk in the areas of changes in United States interest rates and changes
in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the United States dollar.
These exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding
activities. Historically, and as of June 30, 2000, the Company has not used
derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities.

INTEREST RATE RISK
The interest payable on the Company's line-of-credit is variable based on the
prime rate, and, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. At
June 30, 2000, approximately $1.5 million was outstanding with a weighted
average interest rate of 10.56%. The line-of-credit matures in May 2001 and is
subject to automatic and continuous annual renewal for successive annual terms
of one year each unless either party notifies the other of its intention to
terminate the Agreement at least sixty days before the next maturity date. The
Company manages interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents
bearing variable interest rates that are tied to various market indices.
Additionally, the Company monitors interest rates frequently and has sufficient
cash balances to pay off the line-of-credit should interest rates increase
significantly. As a result, the Company does not believe that reasonably
possible near-term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on
future earnings, fair values or cash flows of the Company.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Company has wholly-owned subsidiaries located in Northern Ireland and
England. Sales from these operations are typically denominated in British
Pounds, thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates. The changes in
the British/U.S. exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the Company's
sales, gross margins, net income and retained earnings. The Company does not
believe that reasonably possible near-term changes in exchange rates will result
in a material effect on future earnings, fair values or cash flows of the
Company, and therefore, has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging
instruments. There can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful,
especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the
British Pound.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, " Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities," ("SFAS 133") establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires that
an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure
those instruments at fair value. It also specifies the accounting for changes in
the fair value of a derivative instrument depending on the intended use of the
instrument and whether (and how) it is designated as a hedge. SFAS 133 was
effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. During 1999, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS 133," (SFAS 137") which
delayed the effective date of SFAS 133 until all fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2000. Through June 30, 2000, the Company had not entered into any
transactions involving derivative financial


                                       11
<PAGE>

instruments and, therefore, cannot predict the financial statement impact of
adopting SFAS 133 with respect to transactions that have not yet been entered
into.

In December 1999, the SEC staff released SAB No. 101, "Revenue
Recognition,"("SAB 101") to provide guidance on the recognition, presentation
and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. In order to recognize
revenue, there must be persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery
must have occurred or services must have been rendered, the selling price must
be fixed or determinable, and collectibility must be reasonably assured. The
accounting and disclosures described in SAB 101 must be applied no later than
the fourth fiscal quarter of the Company's fiscal year beginning after December
15, 1999 (fiscal 2001). The Company believes that adoption of SAB No. 101 will
not materially impact its financial statements. However, implementation
guidelines for this bulletin, as well as potential new bulletins, could result
in unanticipated changes to the Company's current revenue recognition policies.
These changes could affect the timing of the Company's future revenue
recognition and results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Hathaway Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HATHAWAY
CORPORATION (a Colorado corporation) AND SUBSIDIARIES as of June 30, 2000 and
1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
stockholders' investment for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
June 30, 2000. These consolidated financial statements and the schedule referred
to below are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hathaway Corporation
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended June 30, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental Schedule II
is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic consolidated
financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in our audits of the basic consolidated financial statements
and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole.

     Hathaway Corporation (the Company) is engaged in the business of designing,
     manufacturing and selling advanced systems and instrumentation to the
     worldwide power and process industries, as well as motion control products
     to a broad spectrum of customers throughout the world. The Company operates
     primarily in the United States and Europe and has three joint venture
     investments in China (Note 3).

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
     and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
     and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

     Investments in joint ventures, in which the ownership is at least 20% but
     less than 50%, are accounted for using the equity method (Note 3).

     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
     Cash and cash equivalents include amounts which are readily convertible
     into cash (original maturities of three months or less) and which are not
     subject to significant risk of changes in interest rates. Cash flows in
     foreign currencies are translated using an average rate.

     RESTRICTED CASH
     Restricted cash consists of certificates of deposit that serve as
     collateral for letters of credit issued on behalf of the
     Company.

     INVENTORIES
     Inventories, valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or
     market, are as follows (in thousands):

1.   BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
     COST IN EXCESS OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED
     Cost in excess of net assets acquired represents the amount by which the
     purchase price of acquired companies exceeds the fair market value of net
     assets acquired, and is amortized using the straight-line method over the
     period estimated to be benefited. Cost in excess of net assets acquired as
     of June 30, 2000 and 1999 consists of $195,000 of original costs, $16,000
     and $10,000 of effect of exchange rate changes, and $120,000 and $59,000 of
     accumulated amortization, respectively.

     The Company reviews its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
     circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
     recoverable. For assets that are held and used in operations, the asset
     would be considered to be impaired if the undiscounted future cash flows
     related to the asset did not exceed the net book value. The amount of the
     impairment is assessed using the assets' fair market value, which is
     determined using discounted cash flows.

     As a result of its acquisition of Hathaway Systems Limited (HSL) in 1991,
     the Company had previously recorded goodwill of $1,197,000. At June 30,
     1999 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
     121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
     Assets to be Disposed of" (SFAS No. 121), the Company determined that the
     unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired from its acquisition of
     HSL was impaired; and, therefore, wrote off the remaining unamortized
     balance of $249,000. The Company's determination was based on projections
     of undiscounted cash flows of HSL, which were based on current marketplace
     conditions, low orders and continuing losses. Such undiscounted cash flow
     estimates were not sufficient to indicate realization of the related
     unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired. Utilizing such
     projections and discounting the estimated cash flows, the Company
     determined that the entire unamortized amount was impaired. Fiscal year
     1999 amortization of $125,000 and impairment write-off of $249,000,
     totaling $374,000, is included in amortization of intangibles and other in
     the fiscal year 1999 consolidated statement of operations.

     As a result of its acquisition of Hathaway Industrial Automation (HIA), the
     Company recorded goodwill of $624,000 primarily due to loss accruals on an
     in-process contract acquired by the Company. As a result of continuing and
     expected near term losses from HIA at June 30, 1998 and in accordance with
     SFAS 121, the Company determined that the unamortized cost in excess of net
     assets acquired from its acquisition of TIS was impaired and, therefore,
     wrote-off the remaining unamortized balance of $406,000. The Company's
     determination was based on projections of undiscounted cash flows of HIA,
     which were based on current marketplace and competitive conditions and
     resulting low margins for the industrial applications of HIA's product.
     Such undiscounted cash flow estimates were not sufficient to indicate
     realization of the related unamortized cost in excess of net assets
     acquired. Utilizing such projections and discounting the estimated cash
     flows, the Company determined that the entire unamortized amount was
     impaired. The fiscal year 1998 amortization of $202,000 and impairment
     write-off of $406,000, totaling $608,000 is included in amortization of
     intangibles and other in the fiscal year 1998 consolidated statement of
     operations.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
     In accordance with SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation", the assets

     U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are
     translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The resulting
     translation adjustments are recorded in the cumulative translation
     adjustments component of stockholders' investment in the accompanying
     consolidated balance sheets.

1.   BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
     REVENUE RECOGNITION
     HIA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, undertakes contracts for the
     installation of integrated process control systems which are based upon its
     proprietary software. These contracts typically require substantial
     customization of this proprietary software. Accordingly, in accordance with
     SOP 97-2, the Company recognizes contract revenues by applying the
     percentage of completion achieved to the total contract sales price. The
     Company determines the percentage of completion for all contracts using the
     "cost-to-cost" method of measuring contract progress. Under this method,
     actual contract costs incurred to date are compared to total estimated
     contract costs to determine the estimated percentage of revenues to be
     recognized. To the extent these estimates prove to be inaccurate, the
     revenues and gross profits, if any, reported for the period during which
     work on the contract is ongoing may not accurately reflect the final
     results of the contract, which can only be determined upon contract
     completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts, to
     the full extent of the estimated loss, are made during the period in which
     the Company first becomes aware that a loss on a contract is probable. The
     Company's traditional businesses (other than HIA) generally recognize
     revenue when products are shipped, evidence of an arrangement exists,
     selling price is fixed, and collectibility is reasonably assured.

     BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
     Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net earnings or
     loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.
     Diluted earnings or loss per share is determined by dividing the net
     earnings or loss by the sum of (1) the weighted average number of common
     shares outstanding and (2) if not anti-dilutive, the effect of outstanding
     warrants and stock options determined utilizing the treasury stock method.
     In fiscal years 1999 and 1998, stock options to purchase 819,004 and
     648,204 shares of common stock, respectively, (without regard to the
     treasury stock method) were excluded from the calculation of diluted (loss)
     per share since the result would have been anti-dilutive. In fiscal year
     2000, stock options to purchase 621,276 shares of common stock were
     included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS
     No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," ("SFAS 130"). SFAS 130
     establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and
     its components in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
     prominence as other financial statements. The Company adopted SFAS 130 in
     fiscal year 1999. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity
     of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events
     and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity
     during a period except those resulting from investments by and
     distributions to shareholders.

1.   BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
     The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans for employees
     and non-employee directors under the provisions of Accounting Principles
     Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"
     ("APB 25") and related interpretations.

     FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
     The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash
     and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, accounts payable
     and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or
     short-term maturities of these financial instruments. The carrying amount
     of the line-of-credit approximates fair value because the underlying
     instrument is a variable rate note that reprices frequently.

     CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
     During fiscal 2000, 1999 or 1998, no single customer accounted for more
     than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenue from continuing operations.

     USE OF ESTIMATES
     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
     accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain
     estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions affect the
     reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of
     contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
     statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
     reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     RECLASSIFICATIONS
     Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' balances in order
     to conform to the current year's presentation.

     RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Derivative
     Instruments and Hedging Activities," ("SFAS 133") establishes accounting
     and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
     derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging
     activities. SFAS 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as
     either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value.
     It also specifies the accounting for changes in the fair value of a
     derivative instrument depending on the intended use of the instrument and
     whether (and how) it is designated as a hedge. SFAS 133 was effective for
     all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. During 1999, the Financial
     Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
     Standards No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
     Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS 133," ("SFAS 137")
     which delayed the effective date of SFAS 133 until all fiscal years
     beginning after June 15, 2000. Through June 30, 2000, the Company had not
     entered into any transactions involving derivative financial instruments
     and, therefore, cannot predict the financial statement impact of adopting
     SFAS 133 with respect to transactions that have not yet been entered into.

     In December 1999, the SEC staff released SAB No. 101, "Revenue
     Recognition," ("SAB 101") to provide guidance on the recognition,
     presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. In order to
     recognize revenue, there must be persuasive evidence that an arrangement
     exists, delivery must have occurred or services must have been rendered,
     the selling price must be fixed or determinable, and collectibility must be
     reasonably assured. The accounting and disclosures described in SAB 101
     must be applied no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of the Company's
     fiscal year beginning after December 15, 1999 (fiscal 2001). The Company
     believes that adoption of SAB No. 101 will not materially impact its

2.   BUSINESS ACQUISITION
     Effective July 1, 1998, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company acquired
     all the outstanding shares of Ashurst Logistic Electronics Limited of
     Bournemouth, England (Ashurst) for $317,000 in cash. Ashurst manufactures
     drive electronics and position controllers for a variety of motor
     technologies as well as a family of static frequency converters for
     military and aerospace applications and has extensive experience in power
     electronics design and software development required for the application of
     specialized drive electronics technology. The acquired company was renamed
     Emoteq UK Limited.

     The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of
     accounting, and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the
     assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair
     values at the date of acquisition. The final net purchase price allocation
     was as follows (in thousands):

     The results of operations of Ashurst have been included in the Company's
     fiscal 1999 consolidated statement of operations starting on July 1, 1998.

     The following unaudited pro forma summary (in thousands, except per share
     data) combines the consolidated results of operations of the Company and
     Ashurst as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year
     1998 after giving effect to certain pro forma adjustments related to such
     items as income taxes, depreciation, and amortization of cost in excess of
     net assets acquired. The pro forma results are shown for illustrative
     purposes only, and do not purport to be indicative of the actual results
     which would have occurred had the transaction been consummated as of the

3.   INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES (CONTINUED)
     The Company accounts for the Chinese joint ventures using the equity method
     of accounting. At the time of the original investments in the Chinese joint
     ventures and until the beginning of fiscal 1998, the Company determined
     that due to the start-up nature of the entities, their untested products
     and political uncertainty in China, the realization of the initial
     investments and subsequent earnings (which were not significant) was
     uncertain; and, therefore, the Company fully reserved against the original
     investments and its share of any equity in income.

     Beginning in fiscal year 1998 and continuing during fiscal years 1999 and
     2000, Si Fang and Kehui's operations have matured, their products have
     gained significant acceptance, and both companies have achieved sustained
     profitability. Because of sustained positive operating results, offset by a
     certain amount of political and business uncertainty in China, the Company
     recognized a portion of its share of equity in income from these two joint
     ventures, totaling $698,000, $329,000 and $222,000 in fiscal years 2000,
     1999 and 1998, respectively. These amounts are included in equity income
     from investments in joint ventures in the consolidated statements of
     operations. The amounts recognized represent management's best estimate of
     the future amounts that will be realized from the joint ventures as of June
     30, 2000. The Company will continue to recognize its share of equity in
     income (loss) from these two joint ventures to the extent it believes such
     amounts are realizable.

     During fiscal 2000, the Company sold a portion of its investment in its Si
     Fang joint venture to another partner, reducing its ownership from 23% to
     20%. The Company received $143,000 and recognized a $126,000 gain on the
     sale. The gain is included in other income in the consolidated statement of
     operations. The Company reinvested the proceeds from the sale plus an
     additional $283,000 in cash to maintain this 20% ownership interest. During
     fiscal 2000, the Company received $139,000 in cash dividends from this
     joint venture. The Company has no future commitments relating to its
     Chinese investments.

     During fiscal 1999, the Company sold 2% of its ownership interest in Si
     Fang for $57,000 in cash and recognized a $49,000 gain on the sale, which
     is included in other income in the accompanying 1999 consolidated statement
     of operations.

     At June 30, 2000, the Company's investments and current ownership interests
     in these joint ventures are as follows (in thousands):

     Prior to June 30, 1999, the Company also had an 11.4% interest in a joint
     venture (JV) with KUB Holdings BHD, a Malaysian firm. The JV was created
     for the purpose of manufacturing, marketing and selling the TIS-4000 system
     in certain Asian countries. As of June 30, 1998, the JV had ceased all
     operations due to unprofitability and the Asian economic downturn. During
     fiscal year 1999, the JV was dissolved and settled its existing obligations
     from its existing assets. The license to manufacture, market and sell the
     TIS-4000 system reverted back to the Company and the Company has no further
     obligations related to this JV.

4.   DEBT
     On May 7, 1998, the Company entered into a long-term financing agreement
     (Agreement) with Silicon Valley Bank (Silicon). The Agreement matures on
     May 7, 2001 and, accordingly, the $1,546,000 balance of the line-of-credit
     has been classified as a current liability as of June 30, 2000. The
     Agreement is subject to automatic and continuous annual renewal for
     successive additional terms of one year each unless either party notifies
     the other of its intention to terminate the Agreement at least sixty days
     before the next maturity date. Borrowings on this line-of-credit are
     restricted to the lesser of $3,000,000 or 85% of the Company's eligible
     receivables (Maximum Credit Limit). As of June 30, 2000, 85% of the
     Company's eligible receivables exceeded the maximum loan amount; therefore
     the company could borrow an additional $1,454,000 up to the $3,000,000
     Maximum Credit Limit.

     The line bears interest at Silicon's prime borrowing rate (prime rate, 9.5%
     at June 30, 2000) plus 2%. The interest rate is adjustable on a quarterly
     basis to prime rate plus 1.5% if the Company achieves a net loss less than
     $750,000 for each previous twelve-month rolling period. The Company must
     continue to meet this quarterly financial goal, or the rate will be
     re-adjusted to prime rate plus 2%. In addition to interest, the line bears
     a monthly unused line fee at 0.125% of the Maximum Credit Limit less the
     average daily balance of the outstanding loan during a month. The unused
     line fee is also adjustable on a quarterly basis, if the Company achieves a
     net loss less than $750,000 for each previous twelve-month rolling period,
     the monthly unused line fee will be adjusted to 0.0625%. The Company must
     continue to meet this quarterly financial goal, or the rate will be
     re-adjusted to 0.125%. The Company qualified for the lower interest rate
     and unused line fee beginning January 1, 2000. The debt is secured by all
     assets of the Company. The Agreement requires that the Company maintain
     compliance with certain covenants related to tangible net worth. At June
     30, 2000, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.

     The Company is entitled to a deduction for tax purposes related to the
     exercise of employee stock options during fiscal 2000, and, therefore has a
     domestic operating loss carryforward of $1,392,000 for tax purposes that
     will expire in 2013 and 2019 for which a benefit for income taxes will not
     be recorded upon realization. The Company also has domestic tax credit
     carryforwards of $334,000 expiring in 2004 through 2008, foreign loss
     carryforwards totaling $251,000 which can be carried forward indefinitely
     and foreign advance corporation tax of $47,000 available which may be
     utilized to reduce future foreign taxes due.

5.   INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)
     Realization of the Company's net deferred tax asset is dependent upon the
     Company generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain
     benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from
     tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards. The Company's management
     believes that, on a more likely than not basis, the recorded net deferred
     tax asset is realizable. The amount of deferred tax assets considered
     realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of
     future taxable income are changed.

6.   STOCK COMPENSATION
     HATHAWAY CORPORATION STOCK OPTION PLAN
     At June 30, 2000, 133,996 shares of common stock were available for grant
     under the Company's stock option plans. Under the terms of the plans,
     options may not be granted at less than 85% of fair market value. However,
     all options granted to date have been granted at fair market value as of
     the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable evenly over three
     years starting one year from the date of grant and expire seven years from
     the date of grant.

     In conjunction with the acquisition of HIA during fiscal 1997, the Company
     granted options for 125,000 shares of the Company's common stock to certain
     key management personnel of HIA with vesting schedules reliant on meeting
     certain performance criteria. At June 30, 2000, options to purchase 54,000
     shares remain outstanding. The options vest during fiscal 2004.

     Option activity in fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000 was as follows:

6.   STOCK COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)
     The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans for employees
     under the provisions of APB 25 and related interpretations. In October
     1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
     Compensation," ("SFAS 123") which established an alternative method of
     expense recognition for stock-based compensation awards to employees based
     on fair values. Companies that elect to continue accounting for stock-based
     compensation plans under the provisions of APB 25 must present certain pro
     forma disclosures.

     Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) and income (loss) per
     share is required by SFAS 123 and has been determined as if the Company had
     accounted for its stock-based compensation plans using the fair value
     method prescribed by that statement. The fair value for these options was
     estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
     with the following weighted average assumptions:

     The weighted average fair value of options granted during fiscal years
     2000, 1999 and 1998 was $0.79, $1.07 and $1.28, respectively. The total
     fair value of options granted was $130,000, $266,000 and $59,000 in fiscal
     years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. These amounts are being amortized
     ratably over the vesting periods of the options for purposes of this
     disclosure.

     EMOTEQ CORPORATION STOCK OPTION PLAN
     During fiscal year 2000 the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Emoteq
     Corporation (Emoteq), amended its stock option plan that was adopted during
     fiscal 1998. Under the terms of the amended plan, options to purchase
     223,636 shares of Emoteq have been granted to officers and key employees of
     Emoteq. All options have been granted at fair market value as of the date
     of grant. If all granted options become vested and are exercised, the
     dilution of the Company's ownership of Emoteq would be 12%. The Company
     accounts for the performance vested options under variable plan accounting.

     Under the terms of the plan as amended, the Company may, upon an employee
     stockholder's termination of employment with Emoteq, purchase the
     terminated employee's shares of Emoteq that were acquired through the
     exercise of stock options (Call Right). In addition, the option holders
     have a liquidity Put Option, whereby, upon its exercise, the Company would
     purchase shares of Emoteq acquired through the exercise of stock options.
     Shares purchased by the Company under the Call Right or Put Option, would
     be purchased at fair market value and would be paid for in cash, Hathaway
     Corporation stock, stock of any parent of Emoteq if it is marketable, or a
     combination of the above. Such Put Right and Call Option may only be
     exercised after the employee has held the stock for at least six months.

     Ownership Plan and Trust (the Plan) and $133,000 from an Officer of the
     Company.

     The Plan allows eligible Company employees to participate in ownership of
     the Company. The $102,000 receivable represents the unpaid balance of the
     original $500,000 that the Company loaned to the Plan in fiscal year 1989
     so that the Plan could acquire from the Company 114,285 newly issued shares
     of the Company's common stock. The note bears interest at an annual rate of
     9.23% and matures May 31, 2004. The terms of the Plan require the Company
     to make an annual contribution equal to the greater of i) the Board
     established percentage of pretax income before the contribution (5% in
     fiscal years 2000, 1999, and 1998) or ii) the annual interest payable on
     the note. Company contributions to the Plan were $84,000 in 2000 and $9,000
     in 1999 and 1998.

     The $133,000 receivable represents the unpaid balance of a loan made in
     fiscal year 1994 to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company in
     connection with his purchase of the Company's common stock, pursuant to the
     Officer and Director Loan Plan approved by stockholders on October 26,
     1989. The loan is full-recourse and bears interest at the applicable
     federal rate determined by the Internal Revenue Service (5.8% as of June
     30, 2000). The loan is due on demand but no later than October 31, 2001.

     Officer which replaced the previous agreement that had been in effect
     since July 1, 1993. This Employment Agreement is renewable after the
     initial five-year term on a year-to-year basis unless the Company or the
     officer gives termination notice at least sixty days prior to expiration of
     the initial or subsequent terms. The Employment Agreement provides for base
     salary plus 1) an annual incentive bonus based on corporate performance, as
     defined each year by the Board of Directors, 2) a long-term incentive bonus
     in the form of stock options, 3) specified benefits upon termination of
     employment (for reasons other than cause or change in control) which are
     effective for one year thereafter and 4) a bonus paid on dispositions of
     subsidiaries or divisions of the Company.

     portion of the current and previous agreements. As of June 30, 2000, the
     maximum amount that could be required to be paid under the termination
     clause of the Employment Agreement was approximately $399,000.
