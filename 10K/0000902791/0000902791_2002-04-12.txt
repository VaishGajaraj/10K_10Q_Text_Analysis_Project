Item 1.  BUSINESS

General

      Barrett  Business  Services,  Inc.  ("Barrett"  or  the  "Company"),   was
incorporated  in the state of  Maryland  in 1965.  Barrett  is a  leading  human
resource  management  company.  The Company  provides  comprehensive  outsourced
solutions   addressing  the  costs  and   complexities   of  a  broad  array  of
employment-related  issues for businesses of all sizes. Employers are faced with
increasing  complexities in employment laws and regulations,  employee  benefits
and  administration,  federal,  state  and  local  payroll  tax  compliance  and
mandatory  workers'  compensation  coverage,  as  well  as the  recruitment  and
retention  of quality  employees.  The Company  believes  that  outsourcing  the
management of various  employer and human resource  responsibilities,  which are
typically considered non-core functions, enables organizations to focus on their
core competencies, thereby improving operating efficiencies.

      Barrett's  range of services and  expertise in human  resource  management
encompasses five major  categories:  payroll  processing,  employee benefits and
administration,  workers' compensation  coverage,  effective risk management and
workplace safety  programs,  and human resource  administration,  which includes
functions such as recruiting,  interviewing,  drug testing,  hiring,  placement,
training  and  regulatory  compliance.  These  services are  typically  provided
through a variety of contractual  arrangements,  as part of either a traditional
staffing  service  or a  professional  employer  organization  ("PEO")  service.
Staffing  services  include  on-demand  or  short-term   staffing   assignments,
long-term  or  indefinite-term  contract  staffing,  and  comprehensive  on-site
personnel management responsibilities.  In a PEO arrangement, the Company enters
into a  contract  to  become a  co-employer  of the  client  company's  existing
workforce  and  assumes  responsibility  for some or all of the  human  resource
management  responsibilities.  The Company's  target PEO clients  typically have
limited  resources  available to effectively  manage these matters.  The Company
believes  that its  ability  to offer  clients a broad mix of  staffing  and PEO
services differentiates it from its competitors and benefits its clients through
(i) lower  recruiting  and personnel  administration  costs,  (ii)  decreases in
payroll expenses due to lower workers'  compensation and health insurance costs,
(iii)  improvements  in  workplace  safety  and  employee  benefits,  (iv) lower
employee  turnover  and (v)  reductions  in  management  resources  expended  in
employment-related  regulatory compliance. For 2001, Barrett's staffing services
revenues represented 56.8% of total revenues, compared to 43.2% for PEO services
revenues.

      Barrett  provides  services to a diverse  array of  customers,  including,
among others, electronics manufacturers, various light-manufacturing industries,
forest products and  agriculture-based  companies,  transportation  and shipping
enterprises,  food processing,  telecommunications,  public  utilities,  general
contractors  in numerous  construction-related  fields and various  professional
services  firms.   During  2001,  the  Company  provided  staffing  services  to
approximately  3,300 customers,  down from 4,600 in 2000. Although a majority of
the Company's staffing customers are small to mid-sized businesses,  during 2001
approximately 25 of the Company's customers each utilized Barrett employees in a
number  ranging from at least 200 employees to as many as 750 employees  through
various staffing services arrangements.  In addition,  Barrett had approximately
380 PEO clients at December 31, 2001,  compared to 465 at December 31, 2000. The
decrease in the number of PEO  customers at December 31, 2001 was  primarily due
to the Company's  decision to discontinue doing business with customers who were
not providing adequate profit margins or represented unacceptable levels of risk
associated with credit or workplace safety.

      The  Company  operates  through a network of 27 branch  offices in Oregon,
California,  Washington,  Maryland, Delaware, Idaho, Arizona and North Carolina.
Barrett also has several smaller  recruiting offices in its general market areas
under the direction of a branch office.

                                     PART I

Operating Strategies
      The Company's principal operating strategies are to: (i) provide effective
human  resource  management  services  through a unique and  efficient  blend of
staffing and PEO  arrangements,  (ii)  promote a  decentralized  and  autonomous
management  philosophy  and  structure,  (iii)  leverage  zone and branch  level
economies of scale,  (iv)  motivate  employees  through  wealth  sharing and (v)
control workers' compensation costs through effective risk management.

Growth Strategies
      The  Company's  principal  growth  strategies  are to: (i)  utilize a zone
management   structure  to  strengthen  and  expand  operations,   (ii)  enhance
management  information  systems  to  support  continued  growth  and to improve
customer   services   and   (iii)   expand   through   acquisitions   of   human
resource-related businesses in new and existing geographic markets.

Acquisitions
      The Company reviews  acquisition  opportunities on an ongoing basis. While
growth  through  acquisition  has been a major element of the Company's  overall
strategic   growth  plan,   there  can  be  no  assurance  that  any  additional
acquisitions  will be completed in the  foreseeable  future,  or that any future
acquisitions  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  the  Company's   performance.
Acquisitions  involve a number of potential  risks,  including  the diversion of
management's  attention to the  assimilation  of the operations and personnel of
the acquired  companies,  exposure to workers'  compensation  and other costs in
differing regulatory  environments,  adverse short-term effects on the Company's
operating  results,  integration  of  management  information  systems  and  the
amortization of acquired intangible assets.

The Company's Services
      Overview of Services.  Barrett's services are typically provided through a
variety of contractual  arrangements,  as part of either a traditional  staffing
service  or a  PEO  service.  These  contractual  arrangements  also  provide  a
continuum of human resource  management  services.  While some services are more
frequently  associated with Barrett's  co-employer  arrangements,  the Company's
expertise  in such areas as safety  services  and  personnel-related  regulatory
compliance may also be utilized by its staffing  services  customers through the
Company's human resource  management  services.  The Company's range of services
and expertise in human resource management encompasses five major categories:

         o    Payroll  Processing.  For both the Company's staffing services and
              PEO employees,  the Company performs all functions associated with
              payroll   administration,   including   preparing  and  delivering
              paychecks,  computing  tax  withholding  and  payroll  deductions,
              handling  garnishments,  computing  vacation  and  sick  pay,  and
              preparing W-2 forms and  accounting  reports  through  centralized
              operations at its headquarters in Portland, Oregon.

         o    Employee  Benefits  and  Administration.  As a result of its size,
              Barrett is able to offer employee benefits which are typically not
              available  at  an  affordable  cost  to  many  of  its  customers,
              particularly  those with fewer than 100 employees.  These benefits
              include  health care  insurance,  a 401(k) savings plan, a Section
              125  cafeteria  plan,  life  and  disability   insurance,   claims
              administration and a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

         o    Safety  Services.  Barrett  offers  safety  services  to both  its
              staffing  services and PEO customers in keeping with its corporate
              philosophy  of "making  the  workplace  safer." The Company has at
              least one risk manager  available at each branch office to perform
              workplace  safety  assessments  for each of its  customers  and to
              recommend  actions  to achieve  safer  operations.  The

                                     PART I


              Company's  services include safety training and safety manuals for
              both  workers  and  supervisors,  job-site  visits  and  meetings,
              improvements  in  workplace  procedures  and  equipment to further
              reduce  the risk of  injury,  compliance  with OSHA  requirements,
              environmental  regulations,   workplace  regulation  by  the  U.S.
              Department   of   Labor   and   state    agencies   and   accident
              investigations.   As  discussed   under   "Self-Insured   Workers'
              Compensation   Program"  below,   the  Company  also  pays  safety
              incentives to its customers who achieve  improvements in workplace
              safety.

         o    Workers'  Compensation  Coverage.  Beginning in 1987,  the Company
              obtained  self-insured  employer status for workers'  compensation
              coverage  in Oregon  and is  currently  a  qualified  self-insured
              employer in many of the states in which it  operates.  Through its
              third-party  administrators,  Barrett  provides claims  management
              services to its PEO customers.  As discussed  under  "Self-Insured
              Workers'   Compensation   Program"   below,   the  Company   works
              aggressively at managing job injury claims,  including identifying
              fraudulent  claims and utilizing  its staffing  services to return
              workers to active employment  earlier.  As a result of its efforts
              to manage workers'  compensation  costs, the Company is often able
              to reduce its clients' overall expenses arising out of job-related
              injuries and insurance.

         o    Human  Resource  Administration.  Barrett  offers its  clients the
              opportunity    to   leverage   the    Company's    experience   in
              personnel-related  regulatory  compliance.  For both its  staffing
              services  employees  and PEO  clients,  the  Company  handles  the
              burdens of advertising,  recruitment,  skills testing,  evaluating
              job  applications  and references,  drug  screening,  criminal and
              motor vehicle records  reviews,  hiring,  and compliance with such
              employment  regulatory  areas as  immigration,  the Americans with
              Disabilities Act, and federal and state labor regulations.

      Staffing  Services.  Barrett's  staffing  services  include  on-demand  or
short-term staffing assignments, contract staffing, long-term or indefinite-term
on-site  management  and  human  resource  administration.  Short-term  staffing
involves employee demands caused by such factors as seasonality, fluctuations in
customer  demand,  vacations,  illnesses,  parental leave,  and special projects
without  incurring  the  ongoing  expense  and  administrative  responsibilities
associated with recruiting, hiring and retaining additional permanent employees.
As more and more  companies  focus on  effectively  managing  variable costs and
reducing fixed overhead, the use of employees on a short-term basis allows firms
to utilize  the  "just-in-time"  approach  for their  personnel  needs,  thereby
converting a portion of their fixed personnel costs to a variable expense.

      Contract  staffing  refers  to  the  Company's  responsibilities  for  the
placement of employees  for a period of more than three months or an  indefinite
period. This type of arrangement often involves outsourcing an entire department
in a large corporation or providing the workforce for a large project.

      In an  on-site  management  arrangement,  Barrett  places  an  experienced
manager on site at a customer's  place of business.  The manager is  responsible
for conducting all  recruiting,  screening,  interviewing,  testing,  hiring and
employee  placement  functions  at the  customer's  facility  for a long-term or
indefinite period.

      The  Company's  staffing  services  customers  operate in a broad range of
businesses,   including   forest  products  and   agriculture-based   companies,
electronic   manufacturers,   transportation   and  shipping   companies,   food
processors,  professional  firms and  construction



                                      -4-
<PAGE>

                                     PART I


contractors.  Such  customers  range in size from small local firms to companies
with international operations, which use Barrett's services on a domestic basis.
None of the Company's  staffing services  customers  individually  accounted for
more than 3% of its total 2001 revenues.

      In 2001, the light industrial  sector generated  approximately  74% of the
Company's staffing services revenues,  while clerical office staff accounted for
18% of such  revenues and  technical  personnel  represented  the balance of 8%.
Light industrial workers in the Company's employ perform such tasks as operation
of machinery, manufacturing,  loading and shipping, site preparation for special
events,  construction-site cleanup and janitorial services.  Technical personnel
include  electronic  parts  assembly  workers  and  designers  and  drafters  of
electronic parts.

      Barrett  emphasizes  prompt,  personalized  service in assigning  quality,
trained,  drug-free  personnel at  competitive  rates to its  staffing  services
customers.  The Company uses internally developed computer databases of employee
skills and  availability  at each of its branches to match  customer  needs with
available  qualified  employees.  The Company  emphasizes the  development of an
understanding  of the  unique  requirements  of  its  clientele  by its  account
managers.  Customers are offered a "money-back"  guarantee if dissatisfied  with
staffing employees placed by Barrett.

      The  Company  utilizes a variety of methods to recruit  its work force for
staffing  services,  including  among others,  referrals by existing  employees,
newspaper  advertising  and  marketing  brochures  distributed  at colleges  and
vocational  schools.  The employee  application  process  includes an interview,
skills  assessment  test,  reference   verification  and  drug  screening.   The
recruiting of qualified  employees  requires more effort when unemployment rates
are  low.  In   mid-2000,   the  Company   implemented   a  new,   comprehensive
pre-employment   screening   test  to  further   ensure  that   applicants   are
appropriately qualified for employment.

      Barrett's  staffing  services  employees are not under its direct  control
while  working  at a  customer's  business.  Barrett  has  not  experienced  any
significant  liability due to claims arising out of negligent acts or misconduct
by its staffing services employees.  The possibility exists,  however, of claims
being  asserted  against the Company  which may exceed the  Company's  liability
insurance coverage,  with a resulting negative effect on the Company's financial
condition.

      PEO Services. Many businesses, particularly those with a limited number of
employees,  find personnel administration  requirements to be unduly complex and
time consuming. These businesses often cannot justify the expense of a full-time
human resource staff. In addition,  the escalating  costs of health and workers'
compensation insurance in recent years, coupled with the increased complexity of
laws  and  regulations  affecting  the  workplace,  have  created  a  compelling
opportunity  for small to mid-sized  businesses  to outsource  these  managerial
burdens. The outsourcing of non-core business functions,  such as human resource
administration,  enables small  enterprises to devote their limited resources to
their core competencies.

      In a PEO services arrangement,  Barrett enters into a contract to become a
co-employer  of the  client  company's  existing  workforce.  Pursuant  to  this
contract,  Barrett assumes  responsibility for some or all of the human resource
management  responsibilities,  including  payroll  and payroll  taxes,  employee
benefits,  health insurance,  workers' compensation  coverage,  workplace safety
programs, compliance with federal and state employment laws, labor and workplace
regulatory requirements and related administrative responsibilities. Barrett has
the  right to hire  and fire its PEO  employees,  although  the  client  company
remains responsible for day-to-day assignments, supervision and training and, in
most cases, recruiting.

                                      -5-

                                     PART I

      The Company  began  offering PEO services to Oregon  customers in 1990 and
subsequently  expanded these  services to other states.  The Company has entered
into  co-employer  arrangements  with  a  wide  variety  of  clients,  including
companies  involved in moving and shipping,  professional  firms,  construction,
retail,  manufacturing  and distribution  businesses.  PEO clients are typically
small to mid-sized  businesses  with up to 100 employees.  None of the Company's
PEO clients individually accounted for more than 3% of its total annual revenues
during 2001.

      Prior to entering into a co-employer arrangement,  the Company performs an
analysis of the potential  client's actual  personnel and workers'  compensation
costs based on  information  provided by the customer.  Barrett  introduces  its
workplace safety program and recommends improvements in procedures and equipment
following a safety  inspection of the customer's  facilities which the potential
client must agree to implement as part of the co-employer  arrangement.  Barrett
also  offers  significant  financial  incentives  to PEO  clients to  maintain a
safe-work environment.

      The Company's standard PEO services agreement provides for services for an
indefinite  term,  until notice of  termination  is given by either  party.  The
agreement  permits  cancellation by either party upon 30 days written notice. In
addition,  the Company may  terminate  the  agreement at any time for  specified
reasons,  including  nonpayment or failure to follow Barrett's  workplace safety
program.

      The form of agreement also provides for  indemnification of the Company by
the client  against  losses  arising out of any default by the client  under the
agreement,  including failure to comply with any employment-related,  health and
safety or  immigration  laws or  regulations.  The Company also requires the PEO
client to maintain comprehensive  liability coverage in the amount of $1 million
for acts of its  work-site  employees.  In  addition,  the  Company  has  excess
liability  insurance  coverage.  Although no claims exceeding such policy limits
have been paid by the Company to date,  the  possibility  exists that claims for
amounts in excess of sums available to the Company  through  indemnification  or
insurance  may be  asserted  in the future,  which  could  adversely  affect the
Company's profitability.

Sales and Marketing
      The  Company   markets  its  services   primarily   through  direct  sales
presentations by its branch office account  managers.  Barrett develops customer
prospects   through  the  utilization  of   state-of-the-art   customer  contact
management  software,   which  incorporates  tailored  databases  of  businesses
purchased  from a third-party  vendor.  The Company also obtains  referrals from
existing  clients and other third  parties,  and places  radio  commercials  and
advertisements in various  publications,  including local  newspapers,  business
magazines and the Yellow Pages.

Billing
      Through centralized  operations at the Company's headquarters in Portland,
Oregon, the Company prepares invoices weekly for its staffing services customers
and following the end of each payroll period for PEO clients.  Health  insurance
premiums are passed  through to PEO clients.  Payment terms for most PEO clients
are due on the invoice date.

Self-Insured Workers' Compensation Program
      A principal service provided by Barrett to its customers, particularly its
PEO  clients,  is workers'  compensation  coverage.  As the  employer of record,
Barrett is responsible for complying with applicable statutory  requirements for
workers' compensation  coverage.  The Company's workplace safety services,  also
described  under "Overview of Services," are closely tied to its approach to the
management of workers' compensation risk.

      Elements  of Workers'  Compensation  System.  State law (and,  for certain
types of employees,  federal law) generally  mandates that an employer reimburse
its  employees  for the costs of medical care and other  specified  benefits for
injuries  or  illnesses  incurred  in the  course and scope of  employment.  The
benefits  payable  for  various  categories  of claims are  determined  by state
regulation  and vary with the  severity  and nature of the injury or illness and
other  specified  factors.  In return for this guaranteed  protection,  workers'
compensation is an exclusive  remedy and employees are generally  precluded from
seeking other damages from their  employer for workplace  injuries.  Most states
require  employers  to maintain  workers'  compensation  insurance  or otherwise
demonstrate financial  responsibility to meet workers' compensation  obligations
to employees.  In many states,  employers  who meet certain  financial and other
requirements are permitted to self-insure.

      Self Insurance for Workers' Compensation. In August 1987, Barrett became a
self-insured  employer for workers' compensation coverage in Oregon. The Company
subsequently  obtained self-insured employer status for workers' compensation in
four  additional  states,  Maryland,  Washington,  Delaware and  California.  In
addition,  in May 1995, the Company was granted self-insured  employer status by
the U.S.  Department  of Labor  for  longshore  and  harbor  ("USL&H")  workers'
compensation coverage. Effective April 16, 2001, the Company voluntarily elected
to terminate its USL&H self-insured status.  Regulations governing  self-insured
employers in each jurisdiction typically require the employer to maintain surety
deposits of cash,  government securities or other financial instruments to cover
workers' claims in the event the employer is unable to pay for such claims.

      Through December 31, 2001, Barrett maintained excess workers' compensation
insurance for single  occurrences  exceeding  $400,000  (except for $500,000 for
USL&H coverage through April 16, 2001) with statutory limits (i.e., in unlimited
amounts)  pursuant  to annual  policies  with  major  insurance  companies.  The
excess-insurance  policies contain standard exclusions from coverage,  including
punitive damages, fines or penalties in connection with violation of any statute
or regulation and losses covered by other insurance or indemnity provisions.

      Claims  Management.  As a self-insured  employer,  the Company's  workers'
compensation expense is tied directly to the incidence and severity of workplace
injuries to its  employees.  Barrett seeks to contain its workers'  compensation
costs  through an  aggressive  approach to claims  management.  The Company uses
managed-care  systems to reduce  medical  costs and keeps  time-loss  costs to a
minimum  by  assigning  injured  workers,   whenever  possible,   to  short-term
assignments  which accommodate the workers'  physical  limitations.  The Company
believes that these  assignments  minimize both time actually lost from work and
covered  time-loss costs.  Barrett has also engaged  third-party  administrators
("TPAs") to provide additional claims management  expertise.  Typical management
procedures  include  performing  thorough and prompt on-site  investigations  of
claims filed by  employees,  working  with  physicians  to  encourage  efficient
medical  management  of cases,  denying  questionable  claims and  attempting to
negotiate  early  settlements to eliminate  future case  development  and costs.
Barrett also maintains a corporate-wide  pre-employment  drug screening  program
and a mandatory  post-injury drug test. The program is believed to have resulted
in a reduction in the frequency of  fraudulent  claims and in accidents in which
the use of illegal drugs appears to have been a contributing factor.

      Elements of Self-Insurance  Costs. The costs associated with the Company's
self-insured  workers'  compensation  program include case reserves for reported
claims, an additional expense provision  (referred to as the "IBNR reserve") for
unanticipated  increases  in the cost of open injury  claims  (known as "adverse
loss  development")  and for claims  incurred in prior periods but not reported,
fees payable to the Company's TPAs, additional claims  administration  expenses,
administrative   fees  payable  to  state  and  federal  workers'



                                      -7-

                                     PART I

compensation  regulatory  agencies,  premiums for excess  workers'  compensation
insurance,  legal fees and safety  incentive  payments.  Although  not  directly
related  to the  size  of the  Company's  payroll,  the  number  of  claims  and
correlative  loss  payments may be expected to increase with growth in the total
number of  employees.  The state  assessments  are  typically  based on  payroll
amounts  and, to a limited  extent,  the amount of permanent  disability  awards
during the previous year.  Excess  insurance  premiums are also based in part on
the size of the Company's payroll. Safety incentives expense may increase as the
number of the Company's PEO employees rises,  although increases will only occur
for any given PEO client if such  client's  claims  costs are below  agreed-upon
amounts.

Workers' Compensation Claims Experience and Reserves
      The Company  recognizes its liability for the ultimate payment of incurred
claims and claims  adjustment  expenses by accruing  liabilities which represent
estimates of future  amounts  necessary to pay claims and related  expenses with
respect to covered events that have occurred.  When a claim involving a probable
loss is reported, the Company's TPA establishes a case reserve for the estimated
amount of ultimate  loss.  The estimate  reflects an informed  judgment based on
established case reserving practices and the experience and knowledge of the TPA
regarding the nature and expected  value of the claim,  as well as the estimated
expense of settling  the claim,  including  legal and other fees and expenses of
administering  claims.  The  adequacy  of  such  case  reserves  depends  on the
professional  judgment of each TPA to properly and comprehensively  evaluate the
economic  consequences of each claim.  Additionally,  on an aggregate basis, the
Company has  established an additional  expense  reserve for both future adverse
loss  development  in excess of initial  case  reserves  on open  claims and for
claims incurred but not reported, referred to as the IBNR reserve.

      As part of the case  reserving  process,  historical  data is reviewed and
consideration is given to the anticipated  effect of various factors,  including
known and anticipated  legal  developments,  inflation and economic  conditions.
Reserve amounts are necessarily  based on management's  estimates,  and as other
data  becomes  available,  these  estimates  are  revised,  which may  result in
increases  or  decreases  in  existing  case  reserves.  Barrett  has  engaged a
nationally-recognized,  independent  actuary to review,  at least annually,  the
Company's total workers'  compensation claims liability and reserving practices.
Based in part on such review,  the Company  believes its total accrued  workers'
compensation  claims  liabilities  at December 31,  2001,  are  adequate.  It is
possible,  however,  that the  Company's  actual  future  workers'  compensation
obligations  may  exceed  the  amount  of  its  accrued   liabilities,   with  a
corresponding  negative  effect  on  future  earnings,  due to such  factors  as
unanticipated  adverse loss development of known claims, and the effect, if any,
of  claims  incurred  but not  reported.  Refer  to Part II,  Item 7,  "Critical
Accounting Policies".

      Approximately  one-fifth of the Company's  total  payroll  exposure was in
relatively  high-risk  industries with respect to workplace injuries,  including
trucking,   construction  and  certain   warehousing   activities.   Failure  to
successfully manage the severity and frequency of workers' compensation injuries
results in increased  workers'  compensation  expense and has a negative effect,
which may be  substantial,  on the  Company's  operating  results and  financial
condition.  Management  maintains  clear  guidelines  for its  branch  managers,
account managers,  and loss control  specialists  directly tying their continued
employment with the Company to their diligence in  understanding  and addressing
the risks of accident or injury  associated  with the industries in which client
companies  operate and in monitoring  the  compliance by clients with  workplace
safety requirements.  The Company has a policy of "zero tolerance" for avoidable
workplace injuries.

Management Information Systems
      The Company performs all functions associated with payroll  administration
through its internal management  information system. Each branch office performs
payroll data entry



                                      -8-
<PAGE>
                                     PART I

functions and maintains an independent  database of employees and customers,  as
well as payroll and invoicing records.  All processing functions are centralized
at Barrett's corporate headquarters in Portland, Oregon.

Employees and Employee Benefits
      At December  31, 2001,  the Company had  approximately  10,425  employees,
including  approximately 6,700 staffing services employees,  approximately 3,500
PEO  employees  and  approximately  225  managerial,  sales  and  administrative
employees.  The number of employees at any given time may vary significantly due
to business  conditions at customer or client companies.  During 2001, less than
1% of the Company's employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Each of Barrett's  managerial,  sales and  administrative  employees has entered
into a standard form of employment agreement which, among other things, contains
covenants not to engage in certain  activities in  competition  with the Company
for  18  months  following   termination  of  employment  and  to  maintain  the
confidentiality  of  certain  proprietary  information.   Barrett  believes  its
employee relations are good.

      The Company's  decentralized  management  structure  relies heavily on its
zone managers,  each responsible for overseeing the operations of several branch
offices.  The Company  believes  that its zone  managers  possess the  requisite
business  acumen and experience  comparable to senior  management of many of the
Company's  larger   competitors.   Accordingly,   the  efficiency  of  Barrett's
operations is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified,
motivated individuals to serve as zone managers. This ability is also central to
the  Company's  plans  to  expand  through  acquiring  human  resources  related
businesses  in existing and new  geographic  areas.  If the Company is unable to
continue  to recruit  and  retain  individuals  with the  skills and  experience
required of zone managers, its operations may be adversely affected.

      Benefits offered to Barrett's  staffing  services  employees include group
health  insurance,  a Section 125 cafeteria plan which permits  employees to use
pretax  earnings  to  fund  various  services,  including  medical,  dental  and
childcare,  and a Section  401(k)  savings plan pursuant to which  employees may
begin making  contributions  upon reaching 21 years of age and completing  1,000
hours of service in any consecutive  12-month period.  The Company may also make
contributions  to the savings plan,  which vest over seven years and are subject
to certain  legal  limits,  at the sole  discretion  of the  Company's  Board of
Directors.  In addition, the Company offers a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan for highly  compensated  employees who are precluded from  participation in
the 401(k) plan. Employees subject to a co-employer  arrangement may participate
in the  Company's  benefit  plans,  provided  that the  group  health  insurance
premiums  may,  at the  client's  option,  be paid  by  payroll  deduction.  See
"Regulatory and Legislative Issues--Employee Benefit Plans."

Regulatory and Legislative Issues
      Business Operations. The Company is subject to the laws and regulations of
the   jurisdictions   within  which  it  operates,   including  those  governing
self-insured  employers  under the  workers'  compensation  systems  in  Oregon,
Washington,  Maryland,  Delaware and California.  An Oregon PEO company, such as
Barrett, is required to be licensed as a worker-leasing  company by the Workers'
Compensation  Division  of  the  Oregon  Department  of  Consumer  and  Business
Services.  Temporary  staffing  companies are  expressly  exempt from the Oregon
licensing  requirement.  Oregon PEO  companies  are also required to ensure that
each PEO client provides  adequate training and supervision for its employees to
comply with  statutory  requirements  for  workplace  safety and to give 30 days
written  notice in the  event of a  termination  of its  obligation  to  provide
workers'  compensation coverage for PEO employees and other subject employees of
a  PEO  client.   Although  compliance  with  these  requirements  imposes  some
additional financial risk on Barrett, particularly with respect to those clients
who



                                      -9-
<PAGE>
                                     PART I


breach their payment  obligation to the Company,  such  compliance has not had a
significant adverse impact on Barrett's business to date.

      Employee Benefit Plans. The Company's  operations are affected by numerous
federal  and state  laws  relating  to labor,  tax and  employment  matters.  By
entering into a co-employer relationship with employees who are assigned to work
at client  locations  (sometimes  referred  to as  "work-site  employees"),  the
Company assumes certain  obligations and  responsibilities  of an employer under
these federal and state laws.  Because many of these federal and state laws were
enacted prior to the  development of  nontraditional  employment  relationships,
such  as   professional   employer,   temporary   employment,   and  outsourcing
arrangements, many of these laws do not specifically address the obligations and
responsibilities  of nontraditional  employers.  In addition,  the definition of
"employer" under these laws is not uniform.

      As an  employer,  the  Company  is  subject to all  federal  statutes  and
regulations governing its employer-employee relationships. Subject to the issues
discussed  below,  the Company believes that its operations are in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable federal statutes and regulations.

      The  Company  offers  various  qualified  employee  benefit  plans  to its
employees,  including  its work-site  employees.  These  employee  benefit plans
include a savings plan (the "401(k)  plan") under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue  Code (the  "Code"),  a cafeteria  plan under Code  Section 125, a group
health plan, a group life insurance plan and a group disability  insurance plan.
In addition, the Company offers a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which
is available to highly compensated employees who are not eligible to participate
in the Company's 401(k) plan.  Generally,  qualified  employee benefit plans are
subject  to  provisions  of both  the Code and the  Employee  Retirement  Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").  In order to qualify for favorable tax treatment
under the Code, qualified plans must be established


                                      -10-

                                     PART I


and maintained by an employer for the exclusive  benefit of its  employees.  See
Item 7 of this report for a discussion of issues regarding  qualification of the
Company's  employee  benefit plans arising out of participation by the Company's
PEO employees.

Competition
      The staffing  services and PEO  businesses  are  characterized  by intense
competition.  The staffing  services market  includes  competitors of all sizes,
including several, such as Manpower,  Inc., Kelly Services, Inc. and RemedyTemp,
Inc.,  that are  national  in scope and have  substantially  greater  financial,
marketing  and  other  resources  than the  Company.  In  addition  to  national
companies,  Barrett  competes  with  numerous  regional and local firms for both
customers and  employees.  There are  relatively  few barriers to entry into the
staffing services business.  The principal  competitive  factors in the staffing
services  industry  are price,  the  ability to provide  qualified  workers in a
timely manner and the monitoring of job performance.  The Company attributes its
internal  growth in staffing  services  revenues to the  cost-efficiency  of its
operations which permits the Company to price its services competitively, and to
its ability  through its branch  office  network to  understand  and satisfy the
needs of its customers with competent personnel.

      Although  there are  believed  to be at least  2,000  companies  currently
offering  PEO  services in the U.S.,  many of these  potential  competitors  are
located  in states in which the  Company  presently  does not  operate.  Barrett
believes that there are  approximately 60 firms offering PEO services in Oregon,
but  the  Company  has  the  largest   presence  in  the  state.   During  2001,
approximately  60% and 32% of the  Company's  PEO revenues were earned in Oregon
and California, respectively.

      The Company may face  additional  PEO  competition  in the future from new
entrants to the field,  including  other staffing  services  companies,  payroll
processing companies and insurance companies. Certain PEO companies operating in
areas in which  Barrett does not now, but may in the future,  offer its services
have  greater  financial  and  marketing  resources  than the  Company,  such as
Administaff,  Inc.,  Staff  Leasing,  Inc.  and  Paychex,  Inc.,  among  others.
Competition in the PEO industry is based largely on price,  although service and
quality can also provide competitive advantages.  Barrett believes that its past
growth in PEO services  revenues is attributable to its ability to provide small
and mid-sized  companies with the  opportunity to provide  enhanced  benefits to
their  employees  while  reducing  their overall  personnel  administration  and
workers'   compensation  costs.  The  Company's  competitive  advantage  may  be
adversely  affected by a substantial  increase in the costs of  maintaining  its
self-insured  workers'  compensation  program.  A general market decrease in the
level of workers'  compensation  insurance premiums may also decrease demand for
PEO services.


Item 2.  PROPERTIES

      The  Company  provides  staffing  and PEO  services  through all 27 of its
branch  offices.  The following table shows the number of branch offices located
in each state in which the Company operates. The Company's California and Oregon
offices accounted for 42% and 40%, respectively,  of its total revenues in 2001.
The Company  also leases  office  space in other  locations  in its market areas
which it uses to recruit and place employees.

      The Company's corporate  headquarters are located in an office building in
Portland,  Oregon,  with  approximately  9,200 square feet of office space.  The
building is subject to a mortgage loan with a principal balance of approximately
$397,000 at December 31, 2001.

      The Company also owns one other office building, in Portland,  Oregon with
approximately   7,000   square   feet  of  office   space,   which   houses  its
Portland/Bridgeport branch office.

      Barrett leases office space for its other branch offices.  At December 31,
2001,  such leases had expiration  dates ranging from less than one year to four
years, with total minimum payments through 2005 of approximately $2,254,000.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview
      The  Company's  revenues  consist of staffing  services  and  professional
employer  organization  ("PEO") services.  Staffing services revenues consist of
short-term  staffing,  contract  staffing and on-site  management.  PEO services
refer exclusively to co-employer  contractual  agreements with PEO clients.  The
Company's  revenues  represent  all  amounts  invoiced to  customers  for direct
payroll,  related employment taxes, workers' compensation coverage and a service
fee (equivalent to a mark-up  percentage).  The Company's  Oregon and California
offices  accounted  for  approximately  82%  of  its  total  revenues  in  2001.
Consequently,  weakness in economic  conditions  in these  regions  could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.

      The  Company's  cost of revenues is  comprised  of direct  payroll  costs,
payroll taxes and employee  benefits and workers'  compensation,  which includes
safety  incentives.  Direct payroll costs  represent the gross payroll earned by
employees based on salary or hourly wages.  Payroll taxes and employee  benefits
consist of the employer's portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes, federal
unemployment  taxes, state  unemployment  taxes and employee  reimbursements for
materials, supplies and other expenses, which are paid by the customer. Workers'
compensation  expense  consists  primarily  of the  costs  associated  with  the
Company's  self-insured  workers' compensation program, such as claims reserves,
claims administration fees, legal fees, state and federal  administrative agency
fees and reinsurance costs for catastrophic injuries. The Company also maintains
separate  workers'  compensation  insurance  policies for  employees  working in
states where the Company is not self-insured.  Safety incentives, a component of
workers'  compensation  expense,  represent cash  incentives paid to certain PEO
client  companies  for  maintaining  safe-work  practices  in order to  minimize
workplace injuries. The incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and
is paid  annually to  customers  who meet  predetermined  workers'  compensation
claims cost objectives.

      The  largest  portion  of  workers'  compensation  expense  is the cost of
workplace  injury claims.  When an injury occurs and is reported to the Company,
the Company's respective  independent  third-party claims administrator  ("TPA")
analyzes  the details of the injury and  develops a case  reserve,  which is the
TPA's  estimate  of the cost of the  claim  based on  similar  injuries  and its
professional  judgment.  The Company then records,  or accrues, an expense and a
corresponding  liability based upon the TPA's estimates for claims reserves.  As
cash payments are made by the Company's TPA against specific case reserves,  the
accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding  payment amount.  The TPA also
reviews  existing  injury  claims  on an  on-going  basis and  adjusts  the case
reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available.  The
Company has established  additional reserves to provide for future unanticipated
increases in expenses  ("adverse loss  development")  of the claims reserves for
open injury claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and
current periods. Management believes that the Company's operational policies and
internal claims reporting system minimizes the occurrence of unreported incurred
claims.

      Selling,  general and  administrative  ("SG&A")  expenses  represent  both
branch office and corporate-level  operating expenses. Branch operating expenses
consist  primarily of branch office staff payroll and personnel  related  costs,
advertising,   rent,   office   supplies,   depreciation  and  branch  incentive
compensation.  Corporate-level operating expenses consist primarily of executive
and office staff payroll and personnel  related  costs,  professional  and legal
fees,  travel,  depreciation,  occupancy  costs,  information  systems costs and
executive and corporate staff incentive bonuses.

                                    PART II

      Amortization of intangibles  consists primarily of the amortization of the
costs of  acquisitions  in  excess  of the fair  value  of net  assets  acquired
(goodwill).  The Company uses a 15-year estimate as the useful life of goodwill,
as  compared  to the  maximum  40-year  life  permitted  by  generally  accepted
accounting  principles,  and amortizes such cost using the straight-line method.
Other intangible  assets,  such as software costs,  customer lists and covenants
not to  compete,  are  amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  their
estimated useful lives, which range from two to 15 years.

Critical Accounting Policies
      The  Company  has  identified  the  following  policies as critical to the
Company's  business and the  understanding  of its results of operations.  For a
detailed  discussion of the application of these and other accounting  policies,
see Note 1 in the Notes to the  Financial  Statements  in Item 14 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.  Note that the  preparation  of this Annual  Report on Form
10-K requires  management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the
reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date  of the  financial
statements,  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenue  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the
circumstances,  the results of which form the basis for making  judgments  about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources.  Actual results may differ from these  estimates  under different
assumptions or conditions.

      Self-insured workers' compensation  reserves.  The Company is self-insured
for workers'  compensation  coverage in a majority of its  employee  work sites.
Accruals for  workers'  compensation  expense are made based upon the  Company's
claims experience and an independent  actuarial analysis performed at least once
per year, utilizing Company experience, as well as claim cost development trends
and current workers' compensation industry loss information. As such, a majority
of the Company's recorded expense for workers' compensation is management's best
estimate.  Management  believes that the amount accrued is adequate to cover all
known and unreported claims at December 31, 2001.  However,  if the actual costs
of such claims and related  expenses  exceeds the amount  estimated,  additional
reserves  may be  required,  which  would  have a  material  negative  effect on
operating results.

      Allowance for doubtful  accounts.  The Company must make  estimates of the
collectibility  of accounts  receivables.  Management  analyzes  historical  bad
debts, customer  concentrations,  customer  credit-worthiness,  current economic
trends and changes in the  customers'  payment  tendencies  when  evaluating the
adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.  If the financial  condition of
the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their
ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

      Intangible  assets.  The Company  assesses the  impairment  of  intangible
assets  whenever events or changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying
value may not be recoverable.  Factors that are considered  include  significant
underperformance  relative to expected  historical or projected future operating
results,  significant  negative  industry trends and  significant  change in the
manner of use of the acquired  assets.  Management's  current  assessment of the
carrying value of intangible  assets indicates there is no impairment based upon
projected  future  cash  flows  and is  predicated,  in part,  on the  Company's
operating results

returning  to recent  historical  levels  within  the next few  years.  If these
estimates or their related  assumptions change in the future, the Company may be
required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded.

New Accounting Pronouncements
      For a discussion  of new  accounting  pronouncements  and their  potential
effect on the Company's results of operations and financial  position,  refer to
Note 1 in the Notes to the Financial Statements in Item 14 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

Forward-Looking Information
      Statements  in  this  Item  or in  Item 1 of  this  report  which  are not
historical  in  nature,  including  discussion  of  economic  conditions  in the
Company's  market  areas,  the  potential  for and  effect of recent  and future
acquisitions,  the effect of changes in the  Company's  mix of services on gross
margin,  the  adequacy  of the  Company's  workers'  compensation  reserves  and
allowance for doubtful accounts,  the effectiveness of the Company's  management
information  systems,  the tax-qualified  status of the Company's 401(k) savings
plan and the availability of financing and working capital to meet the Company's
funding requirements,  are forward-looking  statements within the meaning of the
Private  Securities   Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995.  Such   forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
may cause the actual  results,  performance  or  achievements  of the Company or
industry results to be materially different from any future results, performance
or achievements  expressed or implied by such forward-looking  statements.  Such
factors  with  respect  to the  Company  include  difficulties  associated  with
integrating  acquired  businesses  and clients  into the  Company's  operations,
economic  trends  in  the  Company's  service  areas,   uncertainties  regarding
government  regulation of PEOs, including the possible adoption by the IRS of an
unfavorable  position as to the  tax-qualified  status of employee benefit plans
maintained  by  PEOs,  future  workers'  compensation  claims  experience,   the
availability  of capital or letters of credit  necessary to meet  state-mandated

</TABLE>


Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000

      Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $2,422,000, a decline of
$4,523,000  from net income of $2,101,000  for 2000.  The decrease in net income
was attributable to lower gross margin dollars primarily  resulting from a 32.8%
decrease  in  revenues  coupled  with a 210 basis  point  increase  in  workers'
compensation  expense,  which  represents an increase of 53.8%,  as a percent of
revenues,  partially  offset by a 23.8%  reduction in SG&A  expenses and a 96.5%
reduction in other expense.  Basic and diluted loss per share for 2001 were $.39
as compared to basic and diluted  earnings per share of $.29 for 2000. Cash flow
per share  (defined as net (loss)  income  plus  depreciation  and  amortization
divided by weighted average diluted shares  outstanding) for 2001 was a positive
$.14 as compared to a positive $.73 for 2000.

      Revenues  for 2001  totaled  $216,663,000,  a  decrease  of  approximately
$105,803,000 or 32.8% from 2000 revenues of $322,466,000.  The decrease in total
revenues was due, in part, to the continued  softening of business conditions in
the Company's market areas,  particularly in the Company's  Northern  California
operations,  which  accounted  for  approximately  48.6% of the decline in total
revenues  for 2001,  to  competition,  as well as to  management's  decision  to
terminate  the  Company's  relationship  with  certain  customers  who  provided
insufficient  gross  margin  in  relation  to  such  risk  factors  as  workers'
compensation coverage and credit. As of the date of this filing,  revenue trends
continue to be  negatively  affected by weak overall  economic  conditions.  The
Company  has  recently  hired  several new  managers  throughout  its  operating
regions,  which management believes will have a positive effect on the Company's
business prospects in the future.

      Staffing   services  revenue   decreased   $65,390,000  or  34.7%,   while
professional  employer  services revenue decreased  $40,413,000 or 30.2%,  which
resulted  in a  decrease  in the share of  staffing  services  to 56.8% of total
revenues  for 2001,  as  compared  to 58.5% for 2000.  The  decrease in staffing
services revenue for 2001 was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand for
the  Company's  services  in the  majority  of areas in which the  Company  does
business  owing to  general  economic  conditions.  The  share  of  professional
employer

                                    PART II

services revenues had a corresponding  increase from 41.5% of total revenues for
2000 to 43.2% for 2001. The decrease in professional  employer  services revenue
for  2001  was  primarily  due to a  46.9%  decline  in the  Company's  Northern
California  region as a result  of  management's  decision  to  discontinue  its
services to a few high volume, low margin customers.

      Gross margin for 2001 totaled $18,035,000, which represented a decrease of
$13,770,000 or 43.3% from 2000. The gross margin percent  decreased from 9.9% of
revenues for 2000 to 8.3% for 2001. The decrease in the gross margin  percentage
was due to higher workers'  compensation expenses offset in part by lower direct
payroll costs and payroll taxes and benefits,  as a percentage of revenues.  The
increase in workers'  compensation  expense,  as a percentage of revenues,  from
3.9% of revenues for 2000 to 6.0% for 2001,  was primarily due to an increase in
the adverse  development  of  estimated  future  costs of workers'  compensation
claims primarily related to 1999 and 2000 injuries concentrated in the Company's
California  operations.  The decrease in direct payroll costs,  in total dollars
and as a  percentage  of  revenues,  was  attributable  to decreases in contract
staffing  and  on-site  management,  of which  direct  payroll  costs  generally
represent a higher  percentage of revenues,  and to a lesser extent to increases
in the rates the Company  invoices  customers for its services.  The decrease in
payroll  taxes and benefits for 2001,  in total  dollars and as a percentage  of
revenues,  was primarily  attributable to lower state  unemployment tax rates in
various  states in which the Company  operates as compared to 2000.  The Company
expects gross margin, as a percentage of revenues,  to continue to be influenced
by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and PEO services,  including the mix
within the  staffing  segment,  as well as the  adequacy  of its  estimates  for
workers'  compensation   liabilities,   which  may  be  negatively  affected  by
unanticipated adverse loss development of claims reserves.

      In  connection  with  the  Company's  self-insured  workers'  compensation
program, the Company has maintained an excess workers' compensation policy which
limits the financial  effect of costly  workers'  compensation  claims.  For the
calendar years 2000 and 2001, such policies included a self-insured retention or
deductible  of $350,000  and $400,000 per  occurrence,  respectively.  Effective
January 1, 2002,  the  self-insured  retention or  deductible  on the  Company's
excess  workers'  compensation  policy  increased  to $750,000  per  occurrence.
Management  believes  that the Company  obtained  the most  favorable  terms and
conditions  available  in the  market,  in view of the  effect of the  events of
September 11, 2001, on the insurance  industry and the Company's  size and scope
of operations.  Management  believes that the increased  self-insured  retention
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

      SG&A expenses consist of compensation  and other expenses  incident to the
operation of the Company's headquarters and the branch offices and the marketing
of its services.  SG&A expenses for 2001 amounted to $18,737,000,  a decrease of
$5,846,000  or 23.8% from 2000.  SG&A  expenses,  expressed as a  percentage  of
revenues,  increased  from 7.6% for 2000 to 8.6% for 2001. The decrease in total
SG&A dollars was primarily due to decreases in branch  management  personnel and
related expenses as a result of the downturn in the Company's business.

      Depreciation and amortization  totaled  $3,277,000 or 1.5% of revenues for
2001,  which  compares to $3,192,000 or 1.0% of revenues for 2000. The increased
depreciation  and  amortization  expense  was  primarily  due to a full  year of
amortization in 2001 compared to ten months of amortization in 2000 arising from
the March 1, 2000 implementation of the Company's management information system.

                                    PART II


      Other expense totaled $17,000 for 2001, which compares to $483,000 or 0.2%
of revenues  for 2000.  The decrease in expense was  primarily  due to lower net
interest  expense  as a result of lower debt  levels  and a decline in  interest
rates in 2001 compared to 2000.

      The  Company  offers  various  qualified  employee  benefit  plans  to its
employees,  including its work-site employees.  These qualified employee benefit
plans  include a savings plan (the "401(k)  plan") under  Section  401(k) of the
Internal  Revenue Code (the "Code"),  a cafeteria plan under Code Section 125, a
group health plan, a group life  insurance plan and group  disability  insurance
plan.  Generally,  qualified employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of
both the Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").
In order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Code,  qualified plans
must be established  and maintained by an employer for the exclusive  benefit of
its employees.

      A definitive judicial interpretation of "employer" in the context of a PEO
arrangement  has not been  established.  The tax-exempt  status of the Company's
401(k) plan and cafeteria plan is subject to continuing scrutiny and approval by
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and depends upon the Company's  ability
to establish the Company's  employer-employee  relationship  with PEO employees.
The issue of whether  the  Company's  tax-qualified  benefit  plans can  legally
include work-site  employees under their coverage has not yet been resolved.  If
the  work-site  employees  cannot be covered by the  plans,  then the  exclusive
benefit  requirement  imposed  by the  Code  would  not be met by the  plans  as
currently administered and the plans could be disqualified.

      The IRS has  established a Market Segment Study Group  regarding  Employee
Leasing for the stated purpose of examining  whether PEOs,  such as the Company,
are the employers of work-site employees under the Code provisions applicable to
employee benefit plans and are, therefore,  able to offer to work-site employees
benefit plans that qualify for favorable tax  treatment.  The IRS Study Group is
reportedly also examining  whether the owners of client  companies are employees
of PEO companies under Code provisions  applicable to employee benefit plans. To
the best of the  Company's  knowledge,  the Market  Segment  Study Group has not
issued a report.

      A PEO company  headquartered  in Texas stated  publicly over six years ago
that the IRS National Office was being requested by the IRS Houston  District to
issue a Technical Advice Memorandum  ("TAM") on the PEO work-site employee issue
in  connection  with an ongoing  audit of a plan of the Texas PEO  company.  The
stated  purpose  of  TAMs is to help  IRS  personnel  in  closing  cases  and to
establish and maintain consistent holdings.  The IRS's position is that TAMs are
not precedential;  that is, they are limited to the particular taxpayer involved
and that taxpayer's set of facts.

      The request for a TAM by the IRS Houston  District  reportedly  stated its
determination  that the Texas PEO company's  Code Section  401(k) plan should be
disqualified for the reason,  among others,  that it covers work-site  employees
who are not employees of the PEO company.

      The timing and nature of the issuance  and  contents of any TAM  regarding
the  work-site  employee  issue or any report of the Market  Segment Study Group
regarding  Employee  Leasing is unknown at this time. There has also been public
discussion  for the past  several  years of the  possibility  that the  Treasury
Department may propose some form of  administrative  relief or that Congress may
provide legislative resolution or clarification regarding this issue.

      In the event the tax exempt status of the Company's  benefit plans were to
be  discontinued  and the benefit  plans were to be  disqualified,  such actions
could  have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  financial
condition  and  results of  operations.  The  Company is not  presently  able to
predict the likelihood of  disqualification  or the resulting  range of loss, in
light of the lack of public direction from the IRS or Congress.

Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999

      Net income for 2000  amounted to  $2,101,000,  a decrease of $3,048,000 or
59.2%  from 1999 net  income of  $5,149,000.  The  decrease  in net  income  was
primarily  attributable  to a lower gross  margin  percent as a result of higher
workers'  compensation  expense and slightly  higher  direct  payroll  costs and
payroll taxes and benefits,  expressed as a percentage of revenues, coupled with
higher  depreciation and amortization  and interest  expense.  Basic and diluted
earnings  per share for 2000 were $.29 as  compared  to $.68 for both  basic and
diluted earnings per share for 1999.

      Revenues  for 2000  totaled  $322,466,000,  a  decrease  of  approximately
$25,384,000  or 7.3% from 1999 revenues of  $347,850,000.  The decrease in total
revenues was primarily due to the shortage of available qualified personnel in a
low unemployment  economy, to management's  decision to discontinue  services to
certain  customers due to unacceptable  profit margins or risks  associated with
credit or  workplace  safety  and to a  softening  in demand  for the  Company's
services in the fourth quarter of 2000 owing to general economic conditions.

      Staffing services revenue decreased $6,491,000 or 3.3%, while professional
employer services revenue decreased  $18,893,000 or 12.4%,  which resulted in an
increase in the share of staffing  services to 58.5% of total revenues for 2000,
as compared to 56.1% for 1999.  The  decrease in staffing  services  revenue for
2000 was primarily  attributable to a shortage in supply of qualified people and
to  general  economic  conditions  in the fourth  quarter of 2000.  The share of
professional employer services revenues had a corresponding  decrease from 43.9%
of total  revenues  for 1999 to 41.5% for 2000.  The  decrease  in  professional
employer  services  for 2000 was  primarily  due to the  Company's  decision  to
terminate several marginally profitable or higher risk customers.

      Gross margin for 2000 totaled $31,805,000, which represented a decrease of
$5,691,000 or 15.2% from 1999. The gross margin percent  decreased from 10.8% of
revenues for 1999 to 9.9% for 2000. The decrease in the gross margin  percentage
was due to higher  workers'  compensation  expenses and slightly  higher  direct
payroll  costs  and  payroll  taxes  and  benefits.  The  increase  in  workers'
compensation  expense,  in total  dollars and as a percentage  of revenues,  was
primarily  due to an  increase in the average  cost per claim.  The  increase in
direct payroll costs, as a percentage of revenues, was attributable to increases
in contract  staffing and on-site  management,  of which payroll costs generally
represent a higher  percentage  of revenues.  The increase in payroll  taxes and
benefits for 2000 was  primarily  attributable  to increased  direct  payroll in
California,  which has a higher state unemployment tax rate as compared to other
states in which the Company operates.

      SG&A expenses for 2000 amounted to  $24,583,000,  a decrease of $1,374,000
or 5.3% from  1999.  SG&A  expenses,  expressed  as a  percentage  of  revenues,
increased  from  7.5% for 1999 to 7.6% for  2000.  The  decrease  in total  SG&A
dollars was primarily due to decreases in management payroll and related payroll
tax expense, and profit sharing and related taxes.

      Depreciation and amortization  totaled  $3,192,000 or 1.0% of revenues for
2000,  which  compares to $2,461,000 or 0.6% of revenues for 1999. The increased
depreciation  and  amortization  expense  was  primarily  due to a full  year of
amortization  in 2000  compared  to  seven  months  of  amortization  in 1999 of
intangibles  recognized  in the  mid-1999  acquisition  of TSU  Staffing  and to
increased  depreciation and amortization  expense arising from the March 1, 2000
implementation of the Company's new information system.

      Other  expense  totaled  $483,000  or 0.2% of  revenues  for  2000,  which
compares to $245,000 or 0.1% of revenues  for 1999.  The increase in expense was
primarily  due to higher net interest  expense  related to new debt  incurred to
finance the 1999 acquisition of TSU Staffing.

      The Company's effective income tax rate for 2000 was 40.8%, as compared to
41.7% for 1999.  The lower 2000  effective  rate was primarily  attributable  to
increased federal tax credits earned by the Company.

Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results
      The Company has historically  experienced significant  fluctuations in its
quarterly  operating  results and expects such  fluctuations  to continue in the
future. The Company's operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors
such as  seasonality,  wage  limits on  payroll  taxes,  claims  experience  for
workers' compensation, demand and competition for the Company's services and the
effect of acquisitions.  The Company's  revenue levels fluctuate from quarter to
quarter  primarily  due to the impact of  seasonality  on its staffing  services
business  and on  certain  of its PEO  clients  in the  agriculture  and  forest
products-related  industries. As a result, the Company may have greater revenues
and net income in the third and fourth  quarters  of its  fiscal  year.  Payroll
taxes and benefits fluctuate with the level of direct payroll costs, but tend to
represent a smaller  percentage  of  revenues  and direct  payroll  later in the
Company's   fiscal  year  as  federal  and  state   statutory  wage  limits  for
unemployment and social security taxes are exceeded by some employees.  Workers'
compensation  expense  varies with both the  frequency and severity of workplace
injury claims reported  during a quarter and the estimated  future costs of such
claims.  In addition,  adverse loss  development of prior period claims during a
subsequent  quarter  may also  contribute  to the  volatility  in the  Company's
estimated workers' compensation expense.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
      The Company's  cash position at December 31, 2001 of $1,142,000  increased
by $626,000 from December 31, 2000,  which compares to a decrease of $34,000 for
the year ended  December 31, 2000. The increase in cash at December 31, 2001 was
primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $5,577,000,  offset in
part by payments on long term debt and common stock repurchases.

      Net cash provided by operating activities for 2001 amounted to $5,577,000,
as compared to $11,904,000 for 2001. For 2001, cash flow included  $3,277,000 of
depreciation and amortization, coupled with a decrease in accounts receivable of
$6,900,000 and an increase in workers'  compensation claims and safety incentive
liabilities of $3,294,000,  offset in part by decreases of $2,353,000 in accrued
payroll and benefits and $1,233,000 in other accrued liabilities and an increase
of $1,568,000 in deferred taxes.

      Net cash provided by investing  activities  totaled  $181,000 for 2001, as
compared to net cash used in investing  activities of $1,738,000  for 2000.  For
2001,  the  principal  source  of cash  for  investing  activities  was from net
proceeds of $2,436,000 from maturities of marketable  securities and $266,000 of
proceeds associated with the sale of a company-owned office condominium,  offset
in part by $2,221,000 of net purchases of marketable securities and purchases of
office equipment.  For 2000, the principal use of cash for investing  activities
was

for  capital  expenditures  of  $1,257,000  primarily  related  to new  computer
hardware and software for the Company's new management information system, which
was  implemented on March 1, 2000.  Additionally,  during 2000, the Company paid
$1,122,000  representing  the final  contingent  payment and  acquisition  costs
related to the TSS acquisition.  The Company presently has no material long-term
capital commitments.

      Net cash used in financing  activities  for 2001  amounted to  $5,132,000,
which  compares to  $10,200,000 in 2000. For 2001, the principal use of cash for
financing  activities was for scheduled payments on long-term debt of $3,592,000
and common stock repurchases totaling $2,307,000, offset in part by net proceeds
from the  Company's  revolving  credit-line  totaling  $796,000.  For 2000,  the
principal use of cash for financing  activities was for common stock repurchases
totaling $4,541,000,  scheduled payments on long-term debt of $2,568,000 and net
repayments on the Company's revolving credit-line totaling $2,254,000.  The term
loan was obtained in May 1999 to provide  financing for the TSU acquisition and,
at December 31, 2001, had an outstanding principal balance of $458,000.

      The  Company  renewed  its  loan  agreement  (the  "Agreement")  with  its
principal  bank in May  2001,  which  provided  for a secured  revolving  credit
facility  of the  lesser  of $13.0  million  or 65  percent  of  trade  accounts
receivable  and the  then-unamortized  balance of $1.1  million of a 3-year term
loan. This Agreement, which expires July 1, 2002, also includes a subfeature for
standby  letters of credit in  connection  with  certain  workers'  compensation
surety arrangements,  as to which approximately $3.9 million were outstanding as
of December 31, 2001. The Company had an outstanding  balance of $3.4 million on
the revolving  credit facility at December 31, 2001. (See Note 7 of the Notes to
Financial  Statements.)  As a result  of  financial  covenant  violations  as of
December 31,  2001,  the Company,  subsequent  to year end,  obtained the bank's
agreement to waive the covenant  violations  as of December 31, 2001. In view of
management's  expectations that additional covenant violations will likely occur
as of March 31, 2002 and June 30, 2002,  the Company is currently  renegotiating
certain terms of its loan agreement with its principal bank. Management believes
that such  negotiations  will result in amendments  which will not be materially
adverse to the Company's future operating results.  Such amendments to the terms
and conditions  will likely  include an increase in the interest  rate,  monthly
financial reporting and a monthly  determination of an available borrowing base,
as defined by eligible accounts receivable balances. Management expects that the
funds  anticipated  to be generated from  operations,  together with the amended
bank  credit  facility  and  other  potential  sources  of  financing,  will  be
sufficient in the aggregate to fund the Company's  working capital needs for the
foreseeable future. Although the Agreement, as amended, expires on July 1, 2002,
management  presently  expects  to  renew  this  arrangement  with  its  current
principal bank or to obtain a new credit  facility with an affiliate of the same
bank on terms and conditions which will reflect the  then-current  credit market
conditions and the Company's projected operating  performance.  If, however, the
terms and conditions for renewal with its current principal bank or an affiliate
of the bank are  unacceptable  to the  Company,  management  will  seek the most
favorable terms available in the market. It is management's  further belief that
a new credit facility from  alternative  sources in the market will be available
and that,  while the financial  effect of new terms and  conditions may increase
the Company's  overall  borrowing  costs,  such increased  expenses would not be
materially adverse to the Company.

                                    PART II

      In  connection  with the  Company's  ability to continue its  self-insured
workers'  compensation  program in the state of  California,  the  Company  must
increase its existing  surety deposit with the state,  which is in the form of a
letter of credit, by approximately  $1,567,000 effective May 1, 2002. Refer to a
discussion of risk factors above under "Forward Looking Information". Management
believes  that its principal  bank will  accommodate  the  Company's  request to
provide the increase to the existing letter of credit on a timely basis.

      During  1999,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors   authorized  a  stock
repurchase  program to repurchase common shares from time to time in open market
purchases.  Since inception,  the Board of Directors has approved five increases
in the total number of shares or dollars  authorized to be repurchased under the
program.  The stock repurchase  program had $276,000 of remaining  authorization
for the repurchase of additional  shares at December 31, 2001.  During 2001, the
Company  repurchased  603,600  shares  at  an  aggregate  price  of  $2,307,000.
Management  anticipates that the capital  necessary to execute this program will
be provided by existing cash balances and other available resources.

Contractual Obligations
      The Company's  contractual  obligations as of December 31, 2001, including
long-term  debt,  commitments  for future  payments under  non-cancelable  lease
arrangements  and  long-term  workers'   compensation   claims  liabilities  for
catastrophic injuries, are summarized below:

Inflation
      Inflation  generally  has not been a  significant  factor in the Company's
operations  during the  periods  discussed  above.  The  Company  has taken into
account  the  impact  of  escalating  medical  and other  costs in  establishing
reserves for future expenses for self-insured workers' compensation claims.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


      The  Company's  exposure  to market  risk for  changes in  interest  rates
primarily relates to the Company's short-term and long-term debt obligations. As
of December 31,  2001,  the Company had  interest-bearing  debt  obligations  of
approximately $5.1 million,  of which  approximately $3.9 million bears interest
at a variable rate and  approximately  $1.2 million at a fixed rate of interest.
The variable rate debt is comprised of  approximately  $3.4 million  outstanding
under a revolving credit facility, which bears interest at prime less 1.70%. The
Company also has a secured term note due May 31, 2002 with its  principal  bank,
which  bears  interest  at LIBOR  plus  1.35%.  Based on the  Company's  overall
interest  exposure at December 31, 2001, a 10 percent change in market  interest
rates  would  not have a  material  effect  on the fair  value of the  Company's
long-term  debt or its results of  operations.  As of  December  31,  2001,  the
Company  had not  entered  into any  interest  rate  instruments  to reduce  its
exposure to interest rate risk.

Notes to Financial Statements


1.   Summary of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies

     Nature of operations
     Barrett Business Services,  Inc.  ("Barrett" or the "Company"),  a Maryland
     corporation,  is engaged in providing  staffing and  professional  employer
     services to a  diversified  group of customers  through a network of branch
     offices  throughout  Oregon,   Washington,   Idaho,  California,   Arizona,
     Maryland,  Delaware, North Carolina and South Carolina.  Approximately 82%,
     81% and 79%, respectively,  of the Company's revenues during 2001, 2000 and
     1999 were attributable to its Oregon and California operations.

     Revenue recognition
     The Company  recognizes  revenue as services are rendered by its workforce.
     Staffing services are engaged by customers to meet short-term and long-term
     personnel  needs.  Professional  employer  services  are  normally  used by
     organizations  to  satisfy  ongoing  human  resource  management  needs and
     typically  involve  contracts  with a minimum  term of one year,  renewable
     annually, which cover all employees at a particular work site.

     In December 1999, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued
     Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  No. 101,  "Revenue  Recognition  in  Financial
     Statements" ("SAB 101"). This  pronouncement  summarizes certain of the SEC
     staff's  views on applying  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  to
     revenue  recognition.  The Company was required to adopt the  provisions of
     SAB 101 no later than  December  31,  2000.  The adoption of SAB 101 had no
     effect on the Company's financial statements.

     Cash and cash equivalents
     The Company  considers  non-restricted  short-term  investments,  which are
     highly liquid,  readily convertible into cash, and have original maturities
     of less than three  months,  to be cash  equivalents  for  purposes  of the
     statements of cash flows.

     Allowance for doubtful accounts
     The Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $410,000 and $528,000
     at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Marketable securities
     At December 31, 2001 and 2000, marketable securities consisted primarily of
     governmental debt instruments with maturities  generally from 90 days to 27
     years  (see  Note  6).  Marketable  securities  have  been  categorized  as
     held-to-maturity  and, as a result, are stated at amortized cost.  Realized
     gains and losses on sales of  marketable  securities  are included in other
     (expense) income on the Company's statements of operations.

     Intangibles
     Intangible  assets  consist  primarily of  identifiable  intangible  assets
     acquired  and the cost of  acquisitions  in excess of the fair value of net
     assets  acquired  (goodwill).  Intangible  assets  acquired are recorded at
     their estimated fair value at the acquisition date.

1.   Summary of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

     Intangibles (Continued)
     The Company uses a 15-year  estimate as the estimated  economic useful life
     of goodwill. This life is based on an analysis of industry practice and the
     factors influencing the acquisition  decision.  Other intangible assets are
     amortized on the  straight-line  method over their estimated  useful lives,
     ranging from 2 to 15 years. (See Note 4.)

     The  Company  reviews  for  asset  impairment  when  events or  changes  in
     circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amount of intangible  assets may
     not be recoverable.  To perform that review,  the Company estimates the sum
     of expected future  undiscounted net cash flows from the intangible assets.
     If the  estimated  net cash flows are less than the carrying  amount of the
     intangible  asset,  the Company  recognizes an impairment loss in an amount
     necessary to write down the intangible  asset to a fair value as determined
     from expected  future  discounted  cash flows. No write-down for impairment
     loss was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

     Property and equipment
     Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and
     repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred,  and expenditures for
     additions  and  betterments  are  capitalized.  The cost of assets  sold or
     otherwise  disposed  of  and  the  related  accumulated   depreciation  are
     eliminated  from the accounts,  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected
     in the statements of operations.

     Depreciation   of  property  and  equipment  is  calculated   using  either
     straight-line  or accelerated  methods over estimated  useful lives,  which
     range from 3 years to 31.5 years.

     Customer deposits
     The Company requires deposits from certain  professional  employer services
     customers  to cover a  portion  of its  accounts  receivable  due from such
     customers in the event of default of payment.

     Statements of cash flows
     Interest  paid during 2001,  2000 and 1999 did not  materially  differ from
     interest expense.

     Income  taxes paid by the Company in 2000 and 1999 totaled  $2,331,000  and
     $4,181,000, respectively. The Company paid no income taxes in 2001.

     Net income per share
     Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted  average number
     of common  shares  outstanding  for each year.  Diluted  earnings per share
     reflect the potential effects of the exercise of outstanding stock options.

     Reclassifications
     Certain prior year amounts have been  reclassified to conform with the 2001
     presentation.  Such  reclassifications had no impact on gross margin or net
     income.

1.   Summary of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

     Accounting estimates
     The  preparation of the Company's  financial  statements in conformity with
     accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America
     requires  management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the
     reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and  disclosure of contingent
     assets and  liabilities  at the date of the  financial  statements  and the
     reported  amounts of revenues and expenses  during the  reporting  periods.
     Actual results may differ from such estimates.

     Recent accounting pronouncements
     In July 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued
     Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard No. 141 ("SFAS 141") "Business
     Combinations"  and No. 142 ("SFAS 142")  "Goodwill and Intangible  Assets."
     The  Company's  adoption  date for SFAS 141 was immediate the adoption date
     for SFAS 142 is January 1, 2002. With respect to SFAS 142, the Company will
     perform a goodwill  impairment  test as of the adoption  date, as required.
     Thereafter,  the Company will perform a goodwill  impairment  test annually
     and whenever events or  circumstances  occur indicating that goodwill might
     be impaired.  The Company has not yet determined  what the impact from SFAS
     142 will be on its results of operations  and financial  position,  if any.
     Effective  January 1, 2002,  amortization of goodwill,  including  goodwill
     recorded in connection with prior business combinations, will cease.

     In July 2001, the FASB issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard
     No. 143 ("SFAS 143")  "Accounting for Asset Retirement  Obligations".  SFAS
     143 is effective for fiscal years beginning  after June 15, 2002,  although
     earlier  application is encouraged.  SFAS 143 relates to the recognition in
     financial statements of legal obligations associated with the retirement of
     fixed assets.  Management  does not believe that the Company has any assets
     that require the accrual of a retirement obligation.

     In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
     No.  144  ("SFAS  144")  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  or  Disposal  of
     Long-Lived Assets".  SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
     December 15, 2001, and supersedes  FASB Statement No. 121  "Accounting  for
     the  Impairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets  to be  Disposed  Of"  and  certain
     provisions of  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 30 "Reporting  the
     Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
     Business, and Extraordinary,  Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
     Transactions"  related to the disposal of a segment of a business.  Earlier
     application is permitted.  Management does not believe the adoption of this
     statement  will  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Company's  results  of
     operations or its financial position.


2.   Business Combinations

     Temporary Staffing Systems, Inc.
     Effective  January 1, 1999,  the Company  acquired  all of the  outstanding
     common  stock of  Temporary  Staffing  Systems,  Inc.  ("TSS"),  a staffing
     services  company  with eight  offices in North  Carolina  and one in South
     Carolina.  The  Company  paid  $2,000,000  in cash  and  agreed  to make an
     additional  payment  contingent upon a minimum equity  requirement for 1998
     and certain financial  performance criteria for 1999. The Company also paid
     $50,000 in cash for a noncompete  agreement  with the selling  shareholder.
     During 2000, as a result of

2.   Business Combinations (Continued)

     Temporary Staffing Systems, Inc. (Continued)
     the  aforementioned   minimum  equity  requirement  and  certain  financial
     performance criteria, the Company paid additional consideration aggregating
     $960,000.  TSS's  revenues  for the fiscal  year ended  March 29, 1998 were
     approximately  $12.9 million  (audited).  The transaction was accounted for
     under the purchase  method of  accounting.  The effect of this  transaction
     resulted in the  recording of $1,255,000  of tangible  assets,  $393,000 of
     existing intangible assets, the assumption of $1,646,000 of liabilities and
     the  recognition of an additional  $3,252,000 of intangible  assets,  which
     includes $86,000 for acquisition-related costs.

     TPM Staffing Services, Inc.
     Effective  February 15, 1999,  the Company  acquired  certain assets of TPM
     Staffing  Services,  Inc.  ("TPM"),  a staffing services company with three
     offices in southern California. The Company paid $1,125,000 in cash for the
     assets of TPM.  The Company also paid  $75,000 for  noncompete  agreements.
     TPM's revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998 were approximately $5.7
     million  (unaudited).  The transaction was accounted for under the purchase
     method of accounting,  which  resulted in $1,190,000 of intangible  assets,
     including  $15,000  for  acquisition-related  costs,  and  $25,000 of fixed
     assets.

     Temporary Skills Unlimited, Inc.
     Effective May 31, 1999,  the Company  acquired  certain assets of Temporary
     Skills  Unlimited,  Inc.,  dba TSU Staffing  ("TSU"),  a staffing  services
     company  with  nine  offices  in  northern  California.  The  Company  paid
     $9,558,000  in cash and issued a note for  $864,500,  due one year from the
     date  of  acquisition.  The  Company  also  paid  $100,000  for  noncompete
     agreements.  TSU's  revenues  for the year  ended  December  27,  1998 were
     approximately  $25.0 million  (audited).  The transaction was accounted for
     under the purchase  method of  accounting,  which resulted in $8,622,000 of
     intangible  assets,  including  $184,000  for  acquisition-related   costs,
     $1,797,000 of accounts receivable and $287,000 of fixed assets.


3.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk

     All of the Company's  significant  financial  instruments are recognized in
     its balance sheet.  Carrying values  approximate  fair market value of most
     financial  assets  and  liabilities.  The  fair  market  value  of  certain
     financial instruments was estimated as follows:

     -   Marketable securities - Marketable securities primarily consist of U.S.
         Treasury bills and municipal bonds. The interest rates on the Company's
         marketable  security  investments  approximate current market rates for
         these  types  of  investments;  therefore,  the  recorded  value of the
         marketable securities approximates fair market value.

     -   Long-term  debt - The interest  rates on the Company's  long-term  debt
         approximate  current market rates, based upon similar  obligations with
         like  maturities;  therefore,  the  recorded  value of  long-term  debt
         approximates the fair market value.

3.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk
     (Continued)

     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
     of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments,  marketable
     securities and trade accounts receivable.  The Company restricts investment
     of  temporary  cash  investments  and  marketable  securities  to financial
     institutions  with high credit ratings and to  investments in  governmental
     debt instruments. Credit risk on trade receivables is minimized as a result
     of the large and diverse nature of the Company's customer base. At December
     31,  2001,  the Company had  significant  concentrations  of credit risk as
     follows:

     -   Marketable securities - $1,988,000 of marketable securities at December
         31, 2001 consisted of Oregon State Housing & Community Service Bonds.

     -   Trade  receivables  -  $1,120,000  of trade  receivables  were with two
         customers at December 31, 2001 (8% of trade receivables  outstanding at
         December 31, 2001).

6.   Workers' Compensation Claims and Safety Incentive Liabilities

     The  Company  is  a   self-insured   employer   with  respect  to  workers'
     compensation  coverage for all its employees  working in Oregon,  Maryland,
     Delaware and California. In the state of Washington,  state law allows only
     the  Company's  staffing  services and  management  employees to be covered
     under the Company's self-insured workers' compensation program. The Company
     also was self-insured for workers' compensation purposes, as granted by the
     United  States  Department  of Labor,  for  longshore  and harbor  workers'
     coverage through April 16, 2001.

     The Company has provided a total of $9,250,000  and  $5,956,000 at December
     31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively,  as an estimated  liability for unsettled
     workers'  compensation  claims  and  safety  incentive   liabilities.   The
     estimated  liability for unsettled workers'  compensation claims represents
     management's  best  estimate,  which  includes,  in part,  an evaluation of
     information  provided  by  the  Company's  third-party  administrators  for
     workers'  compensation claims and its independent actuary.  Included in the
     claims  liabilities are case reserve  estimates for reported  losses,  plus
     additional  amounts  based on  projections  for  incurred  but not reported
     claims,  anticipated  increases in case reserve  estimates  and  additional
     claims  administration   expenses.   The  estimated  liability  for  safety
     incentives represents management's best estimate for future amounts owed to
     PEO  client  companies  as a result of  maintaining  workers'  compensation
     claims  costs  below  certain  agreed-upon  amounts,  which  are based on a
     percentage  of  payroll.  These  estimates  are  continually  reviewed  and
     adjustments to liabilities  are reflected in current  operating  results as
     they become known. The Company believes that the difference between amounts
     recorded for its estimated  liabilities  and the possible range of costs to
     settle   related   claims  is  not  material  to  results  of   operations;
     nevertheless, it is reasonably possible that adjustments required in future
     periods may be material to results of operations.

     Liabilities  incurred for  work-related  employee  fatalities  are recorded
     either at an agreed lump-sum  settlement amount or the net present value of
     future fixed and determinable

6.   Workers' Compensation Claims and Safety Incentive Liabilities (Continued)

     payments over the actuarially determined remaining life of the beneficiary,
     discounted at a rate that approximates a long-term,  high-quality corporate
     bond rate. During 2001, the Company maintained excess workers' compensation
     insurance to limit its  self-insurance  exposure to $400,000 per occurrence
     in all states.  The excess insurance  provided unlimited coverage above the
     aforementioned exposures.

     At December 31, 2001, the Company's long-term workers'  compensation claims
     liabilities  in  the  accompanying  balance  sheet  included  $665,000  for
     work-related   catastrophic   injuries  and   fatalities.   The   aggregate
     undiscounted  pay-out  amount  related  to the  catastrophic  injuries  and
     fatalities is $1,444,000. The actuarially determined pay-out periods to the
     beneficiaries  range from 5 to 40 years.  As a result,  the five-year  cash
     requirements related to these claims are immaterial.

     The states of Oregon, Maryland,  Washington,  Delaware,  California and the
     United States Department of Labor require the Company to maintain specified
     investment balances or other financial instruments,  totaling $7,418,000 at
     December 31, 2001 and  $6,241,000 at December 31, 2000, to cover  potential
     claims losses. In partial  satisfaction of these requirements,  at December
     31, 2001, the Company has provided  standby letters of credit in the amount
     of $3,218,000 and surety bonds totaling  $1,207,000.  The  investments  are
     included in  restricted  marketable  securities  and workers'  compensation
     deposits in the accompanying balance sheets.


7.   Credit Facility

     Effective  May 31,  2001,  the  Company  renewed  its loan  agreement  (the
     "Agreement")  with its principal  bank,  which provided for (a) a revolving
     credit facility for working capital  purposes and standby letters of credit
     up to the  lesser of (i)  $13,000,000  or (ii) 65  percent  of total  trade
     accounts  receivable  at the  end of any  fiscal  quarter,  and a  security
     interest  in all trade  accounts  receivable,  (b) a term real  estate loan
     (Note 8) and (c) a three-year  term loan (Note 8) with a remaining  term of
     one year and a  then-outstanding  balance of $1.1  million.  The  Agreement
     expires on July 1, 2002.  The interest rate on  outstanding  balances under
     the  revolving  credit  facility at  December  31, 2001 was prime rate less
     1.70%.  The interest rate options  available under the three-year term loan
     include (i) prime rate or (ii) LIBOR plus 1.35%.  Terms and  conditions  of
     the  Agreement  include,   among  others,   certain  restrictive  quarterly
     financial  covenants  relating to the Company's  current  ratio, a ratio of
     borrowed funds to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
     amortization)  and an EBITDA  coverage ratio.  Additionally,  in connection
     with the loan agreement  renewal,  the three-year  term loan related to the
     Company's 1999  acquisition of TSU was restructured  whereby  approximately
     $1,600,000  of  the  outstanding   principal  balance  transferred  to  the
     revolving credit  facility.  The term loan was then  collateralized  by the
     Company's previously unrestricted marketable securities with a par value of
     $1,275,000 at December 31, 2001.  In addition,  the monthly debt service on
     the term loan was reduced from $222,222 per month to $91,667 per month. The
     maturity date of the term loan, May 31, 2002, remained unchanged.

     As a result of financial  covenant  violations as of December 31, 2001, the
     Company, subsequent to year end, obtained the bank's agreement to waive the
     covenant violations.

     During the year ended  December 31, 2001, the maximum  balance  outstanding
     under the revolving  credit  facility was  $6,254,000,  the average balance
     outstanding was $3,094,000,  and the weighted  average interest rate during
     the period was 5.4%.  The weighted  average  interest  rate during 2001 was
     calculated using daily weighted averages.

9.   Savings Plan

     The Company has a Section 401(k)  employee  savings plan for the benefit of
     its  eligible  employees.  All  employees  21 years of age or older  become
     eligible to participate in the savings plan upon  completion of 1,000 hours
     of service in any consecutive 12-month period following the initial date of
     employment.  Employees covered under a co-employer ("PEO") contract receive
     credit for prior  employment  with the PEO client for  purposes  of meeting
     savings   plan   service   eligibility.   The   determination   of  Company
     contributions to the plan, if any, is subject to the sole discretion of the
     Company.

     Participants'  interests in Company  contributions  to the plan vest over a
     seven-year period.  Company contributions to the plan, before participants'
     forfeitures,  were  $102,000 and $125,000 for the years ended  December 31,
     2000 and 1999, respectively. No discretionary company contribution was made
     to the plan for the year ended December 31, 2001.

     Attention has been placed by the Internal  Revenue  Service (the "IRS") and
     the staff leasing  industry on Internal  Revenue Code Section  401(k) plans
     sponsored by staff leasing companies. As such, the tax-exempt status of the
     Company's  plan is subject to  continuing  scrutiny and approval by the IRS
     and  to  the  Company's  ability  to  support  to  the  IRS  the  Company's
     employer-employee  relationship  with  leased  employees.  In the event the
     tax-exempt  status  were  to  be  discontinued  and  the  plan  were  to be
     disqualified,  the  operations of the Company could be adversely  affected.
     The Company has not recorded any provision for this potential  contingency,
     as the Company and its legal counsel cannot  presently  estimate either the
     likelihood of disqualification or the resulting range of loss, if any.

11.  Related Party Transactions

     During 2001, the Company recorded  revenues of $26,000 and cost of revenues
     of $25,000 for providing services to a company owned by Barrett's President
     and Chief Executive  Officer,  Mr. Sherertz.  At December 31, 2001, Barrett
     had trade  receivables  from this  company  of  $19,000,  all of which were
     current.

     During  2001,  pursuant  to  the  approval  of  all  disinterested  outside
     directors,  the Company agreed to loan Mr.  Sherertz up to $60,000  between
     December  2001 and June 2002 to assist Mr.  Sherertz  in  meeting  his debt
     service  obligations of interest only on a personal loan from the Company's
     principal  bank,  which is secured by his  holdings of Company  stock.  The
     Company's note  receivable  from Mr.  Sherertz bears interest at prime less
     1.50%,  which is the same  rate as Mr.  Sherertz's  personal  loan from the
     bank.  As of December  31,  2001,  the note  receivable  from Mr.  Sherertz
     totaled  approximately  $29,000  and  is  shown  as  contra  equity  in the
     Statements of Stockholders' Equity.

     During  2001,  pursuant  to  the  approval  of  all  disinterested  outside
     directors, the Company entered into a split dollar life insurance agreement
     with Mr.  Sherertz's  personal trust.  Terms of the agreement  provide that
     upon Mr.  Sherertz's  death,  the  Company  will  recoup from his trust all
     insurance premiums paid by the Company.  During 2001, the Company paid life
     insurance premiums of approximately  $56,000. In addition, the Company paid
     Mr. Sherertz a cash bonus of  approximately  $39,000 in connection with his
     personal expenses related to the split dollar life insurance plan.

13.  Stock Incentive Plan

     The Company has a Stock  Incentive  Plan (the  "Plan")  which  provides for
     stock-based awards to Company employees, non-employee directors and outside
     consultants or advisors.  Since inception,  the Company's stockholders have
     approved  two  increases  in the total  number  of  shares of common  stock
     reserved for issuance under the Plan. Currently, the total shares of common
     stock  reserved  for  issuance  under the Plan is  1,550,000.  The  options
     generally become  exercisable in four equal annual  installments  beginning
     one year  after the date of grant and  expire  ten years  after the date of
     grant.  Under the terms of the Plan, the exercise price of incentive  stock
     options must not be less than the fair market value of the Company's  stock
     on the date of grant.

     In addition,  certain of the Company's zone and branch management employees
     have elected to receive a portion of their quarterly cash bonus in the form
     of  nonqualified  deferred  compensation  stock  options.  Such options are
     awarded at a sixty percent  discount from the then-fair market value of the
     Company's  stock and are fully  vested  and  immediately  exercisable  upon
     grant. During 2001, the Company awarded deferred compensation stock options
     for 7,811 shares at an average  exercise  price of $1.45 per share.  During
     2000, the Company awarded  deferred  compensation  stock options for 25,466
     shares at an average  exercise  price of $2.22 per share.  During 1999, the
     Company awarded deferred compensation stock options for 38,613 shares at an
     average  exercise price of $3.11 per share.  In accordance  with Accounting
     Principles   Board   ("APB")   Opinion  No.  25,  the  Company   recognized
     compensation  expense of $17,000,  $85,000 and $180,000 for the years ended
     December 31, 2001,  2000 and 1999,  respectively,  in  connection  with the
     issuance of these discounted options.

     On August 22, 2001,  the Company  offered to all optionees who held options
     with an  exercise  price of more than $5.85 per share  (covering a total of
     812,329  shares),  the opportunity to voluntarily  return for  cancellation
     without  payment any stock option  award with an exercise  price above that
     price.  At the  close of the offer  period on  September  20,  2001,  stock
     options for a total of 797,229  shares  were  voluntarily  surrendered  for
     cancellation.   The  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Company's  board  of
     directors may consider whether or not to grant stock-based awards under the
     Plan to optionees  who  surrendered  stock  options  during the above offer
     period after March 21, 2002.

     The Company  applies APB  Opinion  No. 25 and  related  interpretations  in
     accounting  for the Plan.  Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been
     recognized  for its stock option  grants issued at market price because the
     exercise  price of the Company's  employee  stock options equals the market
     price  of the  underlying  stock  on the date of  grant.  If  comp-ensation
     expense for the Company's stock-based compensation plan had been determined
     based on the fair market  value at the grant date for awards under the Plan
     consistent with the method of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
     ("SFAS") No. 123, the Company's  net (loss) income and (loss)  earnings per
     share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

13.  Stock Incentive Plan (Continued)

     The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 for  providing  pro forma  disclosures
     for 2001, 2000 and 1999 are not likely to be  representative of the effects
     on reported net income for future years,  because options vest over several
     years and additional awards generally are made each year.

     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
     the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average
     assumptions used for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999:

</TABLE>

     Total fair value of options  granted  at market  price was  computed  to be
     $197,000, $674,000 and $769,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
     and 1999,  respectively.  Total fair value of options  granted at 60% below
     market  price  was  computed  to be  approximately  $21,000,  $111,000  and
     $232,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively.
     The weighted  average value of all options  granted in 2001,  2000 and 1999
     was $2.03, $3.94 and $5.22, respectively.
