                                     <b>PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Introduction</b>

  <i>Overview</i>

     Since it&#146;s founding in 1950, Blonder Tongue has been an innovative designer
and  manufacturer  of  products  for the cable  television  industry,  primarily
focused  on  the   development   of  technology   for  niche  cable   television
applications.  This  focus has given the  Company  a  dominant  position  in the
private cable market. During the past several years the differentiation  between
the  franchised  and private  cable  markets  has blurred due to the  consumer&#146;s
increased  expectations  for cutting  edge  services  such as  high-speed  data,
telephony,  and digital video offerings.  In response,  the Company has expanded
its  strategic  thrust to  accommodate  both the  franchised  and private  cable
markets and is a provider of  integrated  network  solutions to all of the cable
markets  that the Company  serves,  including  the  multi-dwelling  unit ("MDU")
market,  the  lodging/hospitality  market  and the  institutional  market  which
includes hospitals,  prisons and schools.

     The cable  market has reacted  quickly to consumer  demands for  additional
services by integrating  multiple  technologies  into their existing networks to
provide consumers  high-speed data and telephony in addition to video offerings.
Telephone  companies have also entered this competitive arena by upgrading their
existing  distribution  networks,  enabling them to be able to provide video and
high-speed data in addition to telephony offerings.  As a result of these market
forces, the lodging and institutional  markets are now playing catch up in order
to meet  consumers&#146;  expectations  that these  services  be  available,  and are
installing  new  infrastructure  and  upgrading  existing  networks.  This  is a
significant  area of  opportunity  for the  Company to market and sell it&#146;s core
product line.

     Most of the changes in the market  segments  that the  Company  serves have
recently been focused on the transition to digital technologies. One of the most
promising areas is Internet Protocol Television ("IPTV"), an emerging technology
which allows viewers to access broadcast network channels,  subscriber  services
and  movies-on-demand.  This  technology  is  already  experiencing  full  scale
commercialization in international  markets such as Hong Kong, Italy and France.
The worldwide  market  projections  are impressive  with an estimated 62 million
subscribers  subscribing  to IPTV services by 2010.  The Company has  negotiated
license  agreements that will provide entry into this promising  market,  and is
currently developing products to meet the needs of customers in the markets that
it serves.



                                       2




  <i>Recent Developments</i>

     During 2006 the Company has continued to advance the  implementation of its
current strategic plan in an effort to maximize shareholder value. The Company&#146;s
strategic plan consists of the following:

o    divesting its interests in non-core business activities,
o    focusing on the efficient operation of its core business,
o    realigning its leadership structure, and
o    implementation  of an initiative to have high volume products  manufactured
     in the People&#146;s  Republic of China("<b>PRC</b>") in order to  substantially  reduce
     the Company&#146;s  manufacturing  costs,  obtain  competitive  advantage in the
     markets served and allow a more aggressive marketing program.

     The Company&#146;s manufacturing initiative in the PRC will entail a combination
of contract manufacturing  agreements and purchasing agreements with key Chinese
manufacturers  that can most fully meet the  Company&#146;s  needs.  The  Company has
entered into a manufacturing agreement with a major contract manufacturer in the
PRC that would govern the terms of its  manufacture  of certain of the Company&#146;s
high volume and complex  products upon a purchase  order being  submitted by the
Company.   The  Company  is  also  negotiating  with  other  PRC-based  contract
manufacturers with respect to other products.  It is anticipated this transition
will relate to products  representing a significant portion of the Company&#146;s net
sales and will be done in phases  over the next  several  years,  with the first
products transitioning within the next 6 to 9 months.

     On  December  15,  2006,  the  Company   completed  the  divesture  of  its
wholly-owned  subsidiary,  BDR Broadband, LLC (&#147;<b>BDR</b>&#148;) through the sale of all of
the issued and  outstanding  membership  interests of BDR to DirecPath,  a joint
venture  between Hicks  Holdings LLC and The DIRECTV  Group,  Inc. The aggregate
sale price was  approximately  $3.1 million resulting in a gain of approximately
$938,000  on  the  sale,  subject  to  certain  post-closing  adjustments.  This
divestiture  is  expected  to  result in  annualized  savings  of  approximately
$525,000  per year.  The  transaction  included a long-term  equipment  purchase
commitment  from  DirecPath.  It is also  anticipated  that Blonder  Tongue will
provide DirecPath with certain systems engineering and technical services.

     BDR  commenced   operations  in  June  2002,   when  it  acquired   certain
rights-of-entry  for MDU cable  television  and  high-speed  data  systems  (the
"<b>Systems</b>") from Verizon Media Ventures, Inc. and GTE Southwest Incorporated.  As
a  result  of BDR  acquiring  additional  rights-of-entry,  at the  time  of the
divesture, BDR owned Systems for approximately 25 MDU properties in the State of
Texas,  representing  approximately  3,300 MDU cable television  subscribers and
8,400 passings. The Systems were upgraded with approximately  $81,000,  $799,000
and $331,000 of interdiction and other products of the Company during 2006, 2005
and 2004,  respectively.  During 2004, two Systems located outside of Texas were
sold.  While the Company  continued to invest in and expand BDR&#146;s  business,  in
August 2006 the Company determined to seek a buyer for BDR and exit the business
of  operating  Systems  in Texas to allow  the  Company  to  pursue  alternative
strategic   opportunities.   In  October  2006,  several  months  prior  to  the
divestiture of BDR, the Company acquired the 10% minority interest that has been
owned by Priority Systems, LLC, for nominal consideration.

     On December 14, 2006, the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Blonder Tongue
Investment Company, completed the sale of selected patents, patent applications,
provisional  patent  applications  and related foreign patents and  applications
("<b>Patents</b>") to Moonbeam  L.L.C.  for net proceeds of  $2,000,000.  In connection
with  the  sale,  the  Company  has  retained  a  non-exclusive,  royalty  free,
non-sublicenseable,  worldwide  right and license to use the Patents to continue
to develop,  manufacture, use, sell, distribute and otherwise exploit all of the
Company&#146;s products currently protected under the Patents. These products include
some  of the  interdiction  lines  in the  Addressable  Subscriber  category  of
equipment.

     On June 30, 2006, the Company  completed the divesture of its 50% ownership
interest in Blonder Tongue  Telephone,  LLC ("<b>BTT</b>").  Under the terms of a Share
Exchange and Settlement  Agreement  ("<b>Share  Exchange  Agreement</b>")  with BTT and
certain related parties of BTT, the Company transferred to BTT its 49 membership
shares of BTT in exchange for BTT  transferring  back to the Company the 500,000
shares of the Company&#146;s  common stock that were  previously  contributed  by the
Company to the capital of BTT.  Pursuant to the Share  Exchange  Agreement,  the
Company  granted  BTT  a  non-transferable  equipment  purchase  credit  in  the
aggregate amount of $400,000 (subject to certain off-sets),  which was exercised
in full by September 30, 2006. BTT agreed to change its corporate name within 90
days after  closing and cease using any  intellectual  property of the  Company,
including,  the  names  "Blonder,"  "Blonder  Tongue"  or  "BT."  As part of the
transaction,  certain other  non-material  agreements  among BTT and the Company
were also terminated.



                                       3



     The Company acquired its 50% ownership  interest in BTT as part of a series
of  agreements  entered  into in March  2003 and  September  2003.  Through  its
ownership  interest in BTT, the Company was involved in providing a  proprietary
telephone  system  suited  to  MDU  development  and  was  entitled  to  receive
incremental  revenues  associated  with  direct  sales  of  telephony  products,
however,  revenues  derived from sales of such  telephony  products and services
were not  material.  In addition to the  Company&#146;s  interest in BTT, the Company
also acquired a 50% economic interest in NetLinc Communications, LLC (&#147;<b>NetLinc</b>&#148;)
as part of the same  series of  agreements.  The Company  continues  to hold its
interest in NetLinc, which owns patents, proprietary technology and know-how for
certain  telephony  products  that allow  Competitive  Local  Exchange  Carriers
(&#147;<b>CLECs</b>&#147;)  to  competitively  provide  voice  service to MDUs.  While  NetLinc&#146;s
intellectual  property  could be  further  developed  and used in the  future to
manufacture and sell telephony products, the Company has no present intention to
do so.



     On February 27, 2006 (the  "<b>Effective  Date</b>"),  the Company  entered into a
series  of  agreements  related  to  its  MegaPort(TM)line  of  high-speed  data
communications  products.  As a result  of these  agreements,  the  Company  has
expanded its  distribution  territory,  favorably  amended  certain  pricing and
volume  provisions  and  extended  by 10  years  the  term  of the  distribution
agreement for its  MegaPort(TM)product  line.  These agreements also require the
Company to guaranty  payment  due by  Shenzhen  Junao  Technology  Company  Ltd.
("<b>Shenzhen</b>"),  an affiliate of Master Gain, to Octalica,  Ltd.  ("<b>Octalica</b>")  in
connection  with  Shenzhen&#146;s  purchase  of  T.M.T.-Third  Millennium  Technology
Limited  ("<b>TMT</b>")  from  Octalica.  In  exchange  for  this  guaranty,   MegaPort
Technology, LLC ("<b>MegaPort</b>"),  a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company obtained
an assignable  option (the "<b>Option</b>") to acquire  substantially all of the assets
and assume  certain  liabilities of TMT on  substantially  the same terms as the
acquisition  of TMT by Shenzhen from  Octalica.  The purchase price for TMT and,
therefore,  the amount and payment terms guaranteed by the Company is the sum of
$383,150 plus an earn-out. The earn-out will not exceed 4.5% of the net revenues
derived  from  the  sale of  certain  products  during  a  period  of 36  months
commencing  after the sale of  certain  specified  quantities  of TMT  inventory
following the Effective  Date. The cash portion of the purchase price is payable
(i) $22,100 on the 120th day following the Effective  Date,  (ii) $22,100 on the
last day of the  twenty-fourth  month  following the Effective  Date,  and (iii)
$338,950  commencing  upon  the  later  of (A)  the  second  anniversary  of the
Effective  Date and (B) the date after which  certain  volume sales  targets for
each of the  MegaPort(TM)products  have  been  met,  and then only as and to the
extent that revenues are derived from sales of such  products.  In February 2007
MegaPort  sent notice to TMT and Shenzhen of its election to exercise the Option
to acquire  substantially  all of the assets of TMT.  Upon  consummation  of the
acquisition,  MegaPort,  or its assignee,  will pay Shenzhen, in the same manner
and at the same times,  cash payments  equal to the purchase  price payments due
from Shenzhen to Octalica and will assume certain liabilities of TMT.

     On November 11, 2005, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary,  Blonder
Tongue Far East, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, entered into a joint
venture  agreement ("<b>JV  Agreement</b>") with Master Gain  International  Industrial
Limited,  a Hong Kong  corporation  ("<b>Master  Gain</b>"),  intending to  manufacture
products  in the PRC.  This joint  venture  was formed to compete  with Far East
manufactured  products and to expand market coverage  outside North America.  On
June 9, 2006, the Company terminated the JV Agreement due to the joint venture&#146;s
failure to meet certain  quarterly  financial  milestones as set forth in the JV
Agreement.  The inability to meet such financial  milestones was caused,  by the
failure of Master  Gain to  contribute  the  $5,850,000  of capital to the joint
venture as  required  by the JV  Agreement  and the joint  venture&#146;s  failure to
obtain certain  governmental  approvals and licenses necessary for the operation
of the joint venture.

     The  Company  was  incorporated  under the laws of the State of Delaware in
November 1988 and completed its initial public offering in December 1995.

<b>Strategy</b>

     It is a constant  challenge for the Company to stay at the forefront of the
technological  requirements  of the  cable  markets  that  the  Company  serves,
including the MDU, lodging, and institutional markets.  Changes and developments
in the manner in which information (whether video, voice or data) is transmitted
as well as the use of  alternative  compression  technologies  all  require  the
Company to continue to develop  innovative  new products.  The Company has added
and  intends to continue  to add new and  innovative  products to respond to the
migration  from  analog to  digital  signal  transmission.  In order to  provide
products and services that allow integrators and operators to deploy triple play
services of voice,  high-speed  data and video (both  analog and  digital),  the
Company has added new products to the Digital Video Headend, High-speed Data and
Fiber Optic product lines. These key product lines are more thoroughly discussed
under  "Business - Products"  beginning on page 7 below.  This  evolution of the



                                       4



Company&#146;s product lines will focus on the increased needs created in the digital
space by IPTV,  Digital Video, and HDTV signals and integrating these signals in
to the optical networks of the future.

     In response to the market  pressure to compete  with Far East  manufactured
products and to expand its market coverage outside North America, the Company is
seeking  strategic  contract  manufacturing  relationships  in the PRC,  and has
already   entered  into  a   manufacturing   agreement  with  a  major  contract
manufacturer in the PRC for certain of its high volume and complex products. The
Company believes that this initiative will reduce the manufacturing costs of its
products,  with  resultant  improvement  in gross  profit  margins.  The Company
expects to commence production of products in the PRC during 2007.

The Company&#146;s principal customers are:

o    Cable  System  Operators  (both  franchise  and  private,  as well as cable
     contractors) that design,  package,  install and in most instances operate,
     upgrade and maintain the systems they build,

o    Lodging /  Hospitality  video and high speed  data  system  operators  that
     specialize in the Lodging/Hospitality Markets, and

o    Institutional  System  Operators  that  operate,  upgrade and  maintain the
     systems that are in their facilities,  or Contractors that install, upgrade
     and maintain these systems

     A key  component of the  Company&#146;s  strategy is to leverage its  reputation
across a broad product line,  offering  one-stop shop  convenience  to the cable
market   customers   it   serves   and   delivering   products   having  a  high
performance-to-cost  ratio. The Company has historically  enjoyed, and continues
to enjoy,  a dominant  market  position in the  private  cable  industry,  while
progressively  making  inroads  into the  franchise  cable  market.  The Company
provides    integrated    network   solutions   for   the   MDU   market,    the
lodging/hospitality  market and the  institutional  market.  As the  Company has
expanded its market coverage,  however,  the distinctions  between private cable
and  franchise  cable have become  blurred.  For  example,  the most  efficient,
highest  revenue-producing  private  cable  systems  and small  franchise  cable
systems  are  built  with  the  same  electronic  building  blocks.  Most of the
electronics required for these systems are available from Blonder Tongue.

     The Company&#146;s  product lines  (headend and  distribution)  must continue to
evolve to  maintain  the  ability to  provide  all of the  electronic  equipment
necessary  to build small  cable  systems  and much of the  equipment  needed in
larger systems for the most  efficient  operation and highest  profitability  in
high density applications.



<b>Markets Overview</b>

     The  broadband  signal  distribution  industry  (involving  the  high-speed
transmission of television,  telephony and internet  signals) has been dominated
by franchise cable television and multiple system cable operators ("<b>MSOs</b>").  The
penetration   of  wireless,   direct-broadcast   satellite   ("<b>DBS</b>"),   such  as
DIRECTV(TM)and  DISH  Network(TM),  in the TV  market  continues  to grow with a
combined  subscriber count in excess of 29 million.  The Regional Bell Operating
Companies  (i.e.  Verizon and AT&amp;T;  "<b>RBOC&#146;s</b>")  also  compete with the MSO&#146;s for
high-speed  data services and are building fiber optic  networks,  on a national
level,  capable of delivering  triple play services direct to the home or to the
curb utilizing packet-based,  Internet Protocol technology ("<b>IP</b>"). The MSO&#146;s are
deploying IP for their Video on Demand  ("<b>VOD</b>")  services and continue to expand
the reach of fiber optic networks in order to maintain their dominant position.

     The long term result of these activities will be increased  competition for
the  provision  of all  three  services  and a trend  toward  delivery  of these
services  through fiber using IP  technology.  This major market  transition has
resulted  in  increased   consumer   expectations,   so  that  the  lodging  and
institutional  markets  are under  pressure to install  new  infrastructure  and
upgrade  existing  networks.  It is not known how long this transition will take
but to remain  competitive,  the Company  must  continue to increase its product
offerings for fiber transmission,  digital television,  IP encoding and decoding
and digital applications.



                                       5



         <u>Cable Television</u>

     Most cable  television  operators,  both large and small,  have built fiber
optic  networks  with various  combinations  of fiber optic and coaxial cable to
deliver  television  signal  programming,  data,  and phone services on one drop
cable.  Cable  television  deployment of fiber optic trunk has been completed in
most existing systems.  The system architecture being employed to accomplish the
provision of analog  video,  digital  video,  HDTV,  high-speed  data,  VOD, and
telephone service is a hybrid fiber coaxial ("<b>HFC</b>") network.  In an HFC network,
fiber  optic  trunk  lines  connect  to  nodes  which  typically  feed 50 to 250
subscribers, using coaxial cable.

     The Company  believes that most major  metropolitan  areas will  eventually
have  complex  networks  of two or more  independent  operators  interconnecting
homes, and multi-dwelling  complexes.  All of these networks are potential users
of Blonder  Tongue&#146;s Analog Video Headend,  Digital Video Headend,  Fiber Optic,
and Addressable products.

         <u>Lodging</u>

     Competition  among cable  operators  serving the lodging  market to provide
more channels, VOD, and enhanced interactivity, has resulted in increased demand
for analog,  digital and high definition  television system  electronics.  These
systems  have been and continue to be well  received in the market,  as property
owners have sought additional revenue streams and guests have demanded increased
in-room technology services.  The leading system integrators in this market rely
upon outside suppliers for their system  electronics and most are Blonder Tongue
customers.  These companies and others offer lodging establishments systems that
provide VOD movies with a large selection of titles.  The typical lodging system
headend  will  include  as  many as 20 to 40  receivers  and as many as 60 to 80
modulators, and will be capable of providing guests with more free channels, VOD
for a broad selection of movie titles, and interactive services.

     Most of the systems with VOD service were initially in large hotels,  where
the economics of high channel  capacity systems are more easily  justified.  The
conversion of hotel  pay-per-view  systems into  video-on-demand  is increasing.
Smaller  hotels and motels are being provided with  video-on-demand  as enhanced
technology  results  in  reduced  headend  costs,   keeping  the  market  growth
reasonably  steady.  A current  trend in lodging  is to provide  "plug-and-play"
high-speed data service to customers and Blonder Tongue&#146;s MegaPort(TM)high-speed
data product is an ideal solution for hotel/motel high-speed data deployment.

         <u>Institutional</u>

     The  Company  identifies  the  Institutional  market as:  education  campus
environments,  correctional  facilities  and short or long term  health  service
environments. What all of these seemingly unrelated facilities have in common is
that they all contain  private  networks  that are  dependant on either  locally
generated  or  externally  sourced  video and/or data  content.  As the advanced
technologies  of VOD, HDTV, and IPTV permeate the market,  these  facilities are
embracing these  technologies  to achieve site specific  goals.  The Company has
traditionally  benefited from a very strong share of this market with its Analog
Video Headend and  Distribution  Products.  We  anticipate  that this trend will
continue and evolve into firm adoption of our Digital  Video  Headend  Products,
which include HDTV and Digital Video solutions and our upcoming IPTV platforms.

     Cable   television   service  for  much  of  the  world  is   expanding  as
technological  advancement reduces the cost to consumers. In addition,  economic
development in Latin America,  Asia and Eastern Europe has allowed  construction
of  integrated  delivery  systems  that  utilize a variety  of  electronics  and
broadband  hardware.  The pace of growth is  difficult  to predict,  but as more
alternatives  become  available  and  television  service  becomes  increasingly
affordable,  it is anticipated  that more equipment will be placed in the field.
The Company utilizes several distributors in Florida and within Latin America to
serve  the  Latin  American  market,  although  during  the last  several  years
international  sales have not materially  contributed  to the Company&#146;s  revenue
base. The Company&#146;s  initiative to  manufacture  products in the PRC will expand
the Company&#146;s capability to manufacture core products at a more competitive cost
and also could lead to the  development  of new markets for product sales in the
Far East. In connection with any expansion, however, there are inherent risks of
international  operations in general,  and  operating in the PRC in  particular.
These risks are described in more detail under "Risk Factors" below.

         <u>Additional Considerations</u>

     The technological revolution with respect to video, data and voice services
continues at a rapid pace. Cable TV&#146;s QAM video is competing with DIRECTV(TM)and
EchoStar&#146;s  DBS service and cable modems compete with DSL offered by the RBOC&#146;s.
RBOC&#146;s are building  national fiber networks and are now delivering  video, data
and voice services  directly to the home over fiber optic cable,  and voice over
IP ("<b>VOIP</b>") is being offered by cable  companies and others in competition  with
traditional  phone  companies.   The  Company  is  also  beginning  to  see  the
convergence of data and video  communications,  wherein  computer and television
systems  merge.  While  it is not  possible  to  predict  with  certainty  which
technology  will be  dominant  at any  particular  point  in time,  the  Company
believes that delivery of services using IP technology will eventually  dominate
the  delivery  systems  of the  future and the  tremendous  bandwidth  available
through the use of fiber optic cable will eventually be the dominant  carrier of
video, voice and data communications signals.

     Since the installed base of United States  television sets are for the most
part analog (not digital),  direct satellite  television,  digitally  compressed
programming  and IP  delivery  requires  headend  products  or set-top  decoding
receivers or converters to convert the transmitted  signals back to analog.  The
replacement  of all  television  sets with  digital sets will be costly and take
many  years to  complete.  The  Company  believes  that for many  years to come,
program  providers will deliver an analog television signal on standard channels
to  subscribers&#146;  television  sets using headend  products at some  distribution
point in their networks or employ decoding receivers at each television set.

<b>Products</b>

     Blonder Tongue&#146;s products can be separated, according to function, into the
several categories described below:

     o    <b>Analog Video  Headend  Products</b>  used by a system  operator for signal
          acquisition,  processing and  manipulation  for further  transmission.
          Among  the  products  offered  by the  Company  in this  category  are
          satellite  receivers,   integrated  receiver/decoders,   demodulators,
          modulators,  antennas and antenna mounts, amplifiers,  equalizers, and
          processors.  The  headend  is  the  "brain"  of  a  television  signal
          distribution   system.   It  is  the   central   location   where  the
          multi-channel signal is initially received, converted and allocated to
          specific channels for analog  distribution.  In some cases,  where the
          signal is transmitted in encrypted form or digitized and compressed, a
          receiver will also be required to decode the signal. Blonder Tongue is
          a  licensee  of  Motorola,   Inc.&#146;s   ("<b>Motorola</b>")   VideoCipher(R)and
          DigiCipher(R)encryption  technologies  and  integrates  their decoders
          into integrated receiver/decoder products, where required. The Company
          estimates   that  Analog  Video   Headend   Products   accounted   for
          approximately  49% of the Company&#146;s  revenues in 2006, 49% in 2005 and
          52% in 2004.

     o    <b>Digital  Video  Headend   Products</b>  used  by  a  system  operator  for
          acquisition,  processing  and  manipulation  of digital video signals.
          Blonder Tongue is constantly  expanding its Digital Products offering,
          which  currently  includes  the QTM line of  Transcoders,  Digital QAM
          Up-converters   for   data-over-cable   applications,   Digital   High
          Definition  Television Processors for delivery of HDTV programming and
          QAM  Modulators.  The QTM line is used for  economically  deploying or
          adding a satellite based digital  programming tier of standard digital
          or HDTV digital programming.  The unit transcodes a satellite signal&#146;s
          modulation  from  Quadrature  Phase Shift Key  ("<b>QPSK</b>") to  Quadrature
          Amplitude  Modulation  ("<b>QAM</b>") or from 8PSK  (HDTV  Format) to QAM for
          signals received from a satellite transponder. Since QPSK and 8PSK are
          optimum   for   satellite   transmission   and  QAM  is  optimum   for
          fiber/coaxial  distribution,  precious system bandwidth is saved while
          the signal  maintains its digital form.  Building upon the  innovative
          design work that brought about the QTM Transcoders, QAM Up-converters,
          and HDTV Processors,  the Company launched the AQD Series of Agile QAM
          Demodulators. The AQD Series allows for the reception and demodulation
          of QAM digital, Off-air Standard Digital or Off-air HDTV signals. This
          enables system  operators in all of  the Company&#146;s  primary markets to
          benefit  from  digital  transmission,  while  preserving  their analog
          distribution  networks and viewing  sites long after the FCC mandatory
          transition in 2009.  Digital Video Headend Products continue to expand
          in all  of  the  Company&#146;s primary markets,  bringing  more  advanced
          technology to  consumers  and  operators, and it is expected that this
          area will evolve in to a major  element of the  Company&#146;s  business in
          the future.  The Company estimates that Digital Video Headend Products
          accounted for approximately 16% of the Company&#146;s revenues in 2006, 13%
          in 2005 and 9% in 2004.



                                       7



     o    <b>Fiber  Products</B> used to transmit the output of a cable system  headend
          to multiple  locations  using fiber optic  cable.  Among the  products
          offered are optical transmitters,  receivers,  couplers and splitters.
          These   products   convert  RF  frequencies  to  light  (or  infrared)
          frequencies  and launch them on optical fiber.  At each receiver site,
          an optical  receiver is used to convert the signals back to normal VHF
          frequencies for  distribution to subscribers.  While sales of products
          in this category have not  historically  contributed  significantly to
          the  Company&#146;s  revenues,  they are expected to increase due to recent
          new product innovations that the Company will be bringing to market.

     o    <b>Distribution  Products</b>  used to  permit  signals  to  travel  from the
          headend to their ultimate destination in a home, apartment unit, hotel
          room, office or other terminal  location along a distribution  network
          of fiber optic or coaxial  cable.  Among the  products  offered by the
          Company in this  category are line  extenders,  broadband  amplifiers,
          directional  taps,  splitters  and  wall  taps.  In  cable  television
          systems,  the  distribution  products  are either  mounted on exterior
          telephone  poles or encased  in  pedestals,  vaults or other  security
          devices. In private cable systems the distribution system is typically
          enclosed  within the walls of the building (if a single  structure) or
          added to an existing  structure  using various  techniques to hide the
          coaxial  cable  and  devices.  The  non-passive  devices  within  this
          category are designed to ensure that the signal  distributed  from the
          headend  is of  sufficient  strength  when  it  arrives  at its  final
          destination to provide high quality  audio/video  images.  The Company
          estimates that distribution  products  accounted for approximately 19%
          of the Company&#146;s revenues in 2006, 20% in 2005 and 19% in 2004.

     o    <b>Addressable  Products</b>  used to control  access to  programming  at the
          subscriber&#146;s  location.  The  products  offered in this  category  are
          Interdiction  and Addressable  Multi-Tap (AMT) products.  Interdiction
          products limit the  availability  of programs to  subscribers  through
          jamming of particular  channels.  Recently,  the Company  introduced a
          consumer  version of this  product,  the TV Channel  Blocker  Parental
          Control,  which provides local (at the consumer  level) control of the
          full analog  block of  channels.  AMT  products  remotely  control all
          access to  programming  for a  particular  subscriber.  Sales of these
          products have not contributed significantly to the Company&#146;s revenues.

     o    <b>High-speed Data Products</b> used to provide  Internet access and transfer
          data  over a  hybrid  fiber/coaxial  cable  system.  Products  in this
          category  include  standard  DOCSIS cable modems,  DOCSIS/Euro  DOCSIS
          cable modem termination system ("<b>CMTS</b>"), and the  MegaPort(TM)solution
          for providing broadband Internet access to hospitality  environments &amp;
          MDUs. The  MegaPort(TM)solution  consists of two main components,  the
          Gateway  and the  Intelligent  Outlets.  The  Gateway  is a  broadband
          Ethernet router or bridge that establishes a network within a building
          or community over the existing  coaxial cable system.  The Intelligent
          Outlet  serves  as the  modem,  but is  permanently  installed  in the
          location to eliminate loss of equipment  associated  with churn.  Each
          Gateway  can  accommodate  64  enabled  Outlets  and  with a  software
          upgrade,  up to 250 outlets. On February 13, 2007, the Company entered
          in to a non-exclusive  distribution agreement with Motorola,  Inc. for
          the sales and  distribution  of Motorola&#146;s  Connected  Home  Solutions
          voice  and  data   products   to  the  private   cable,   lodging  and
          institutional  markets  in the United  States.  Products  feature  the
          industry leading Motorola SurfBoard(R)5101 cable modem and the BSR2000
          (Broadband  Services  Router)  compact  CMTS  featuring   DOCSIS(R)2.0
          qualification. The BSR2000 is a compact,  high-performance CMTS with 1
          downstream  and 4 upstream  channels that is ideal for small or medium
          sized distribution  systems.  The unit offers advanced  functionality,
          allowing  smaller cable operators to efficiently  migrate to DOCSIS or
          EuroDOCSIS  2.0 while  simultaneously  increasing  the  performance of
          their  existing  base of DOCSIS  1.0 and 1.1 cable  modems.  This is a
          relatively new category of products for the Company and has not as yet
          contributed significantly to the Company&#146;s revenues.

     o    <b>Telephony  Products</b> used to provide expanded  telephone service to MDU
          subscribers.  These  products  are  designed  to offer  carrier  class
          telephone  service to residences  using  existing  twisted pair wires.
          Service will be fully transparent to subscribers with advanced calling
          features  such as 911,  Caller ID, Call Waiting  Plus,  and  Three-way
          Calling  available  and  bundled  at a flat rate to  subscribers.  The
          existing  twisted-pair  telephone wiring infrastructure is utilized to
          provide  dial  tone  at  a  resident&#146;s  premises  using  any  standard
          telephone. The Company does not have a significant history of sales of
          telephony  products,  having only acquired the distribution  rights in
          2003 in connection  with its past venture efforts in BTT. Sales volume
          has been lower than originally anticipated and the recent divesture by
          the Company of its  interest in BTT is likely to further  diminish the
          Company&#146;s  sales  prospects  for these  products.  It is not presently
          anticipated that sales of telephony products will become a significant
          source of revenue for the Company.



                                       8



     o    <b>Microwave  Products</b>  used to transmit  voice,  analog  video,  digital
          video,  and data signals to multiple  locations  using  point-to-point
          communication  links in the 18 GHz range of  frequencies.  The company
          offers the full line of products  required to  construct  and maintain
          these  point-to-point,  18 GHz  communication  links.  While microwave
          products will continue to be sold to maintain  existing  systems,  the
          Company  does not  anticipate  that  these  products  will  contribute
          significantly to the Company&#146;s revenues.

     o    <b>Test  Products</b>   used  for  measuring   signals  in  the  Headend  and
          Distribution.  Among  the  products  offered  by the  Company  in this
          category are Analog and Digital QPSK  Analyzers,  Palm Tops Analog and
          Digital  Analyzers and Signal Level Meters . While the Company expects
          to continue selling test products to meet the needs of customers,  the
          Company  does not  anticipate  that  these  products  will  contribute
          significantly to the Company&#146;s revenues.

The Company will modify its  products to meet  specific  customer  requirements.
Typically,  these  modifications  are  minor  and do not  materially  alter  the
functionality  of the  products.  Thus,  the inability of the customer to accept
such products does not generally result in the Company being otherwise unable to
sell such products to other customers.

<b>Research and Product Development</b>

     The markets served by Blonder  Tongue are  characterized  by  technological
change, new product introductions,  and evolving industry standards.  To compete
effectively in this environment, the Company must engage in ongoing research and
development in order to (i) create new products, (ii) expand the frequency range
of existing products in order to accommodate customer demand for greater channel
capacity, (iii) license new technology,  and (iv) acquire products incorporating
technology  that could not otherwise be developed  quickly enough using internal
resources.  Research and development  projects are often initially undertaken at
the request of and in an effort to address the particular needs of the Company&#146;s
customers and customer  prospects with the expectation or promise of substantial
future  orders from such  customers  or customer  prospects.  In the new product
development  process,  the vast experience of the Company&#146;s  Technical  Services
Group is  leveraged  to ensure  the  highest  level of  suitability  and  widest
acceptance  to the  marketplace.  Products  tend to be developed in a functional
building  block  approach  that allows for different  combinations  of blocks to
generate new relevant  products if the market demands.  Additional  research and
development efforts are also continuously  underway for the purpose of enhancing
product quality and engineering  lower production  costs. For the acquisition of
new  technologies,  the Company  may rely upon  technology  licenses  from third
parties.  The Company will also license  technology if it can obtain  technology
quicker,  or more  cost-effectively  from third parties than it could  otherwise
develop on its own,  or if the  desired  technology  is  proprietary  to a third
party. There were 13 employees in the research and development department of the
Company at December 31,  2006.  The Company  spent  $1,634,000,  $1,552,000  and
$1,549,000 on research and development expenses for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

<b>Marketing and Sales</b>

     Blonder  Tongue markets and sells its products  worldwide  primarily to the
following markets: the MDU  market,  the  lodging  market and the  institutional
market.  Sales are made  directly to customers by the Company&#146;s  internal  sales
force, as well as through a few domestic stocking  distributors (which accounted
for  approximately  46%  of the  Company&#146;s  revenues  for  fiscal  2006).  These
distributors serve multiple markets.  Direct sales to cable operators and system
integrators accounted for approximately 28% of the Company&#146;s revenues for fiscal
2006.

     The Company&#146;s sales and marketing  function is  predominantly  performed by
its internal sales force. Should it be deemed necessary,  the Company may retain
independent sales  representatives in particular geographic areas or targeted to
specific  customer  prospects  or target  market  opportunities.  The  Company&#146;s
internal  sales  force  consists of 39  employees,  which  currently  includes 9
salespersons in Old Bridge,  New Jersey, one salesperson in each of North Myrtle
Beach, South Carolina, Cudahy, Wisconsin, Austin, TX and Santa Margarita, CA and
26  sales-support  personnel  at the Company  headquarters  in Old  Bridge,  New
Jersey.

     The Company&#146;s  standard customer payment terms are 2%-10, net 30 days. From
time to  time,  when  circumstances  warrant,  such as a  commitment  to a large
blanket  purchase  order,  the Company  will  extend  payment  terms  beyond its
standard payment terms.



                                       9



     The  Company  has  several  marketing  programs  to  support  the  sale and
distribution  of its products.  Blonder  Tongue  participates  in industry trade
shows and conferences.  The Company also publishes  technical  articles in trade
and technical  journals,  distributes  sales and product  literature  and has an
active public  relations plan to ensure  complete  coverage of Blonder  Tongue&#146;s
products  and  technology  by editors of trade  journals.  The Company  provides
system  design  engineering  for  its  customers,  maintains  extensive  ongoing
communications with many original equipment  manufacturer customers and provides
one-on-one  demonstrations  and technical  seminars to potential new  customers.
Blonder Tongue supplies sales and applications  support,  product literature and
training to its sales  representatives  and distributors.  The management of the
Company travels  extensively,  identifying  customer needs and meeting potential
customers.

     The Company had approximately  $3,400,000 in purchase orders as of December
31, 2006 and  approximately  $2,800,000  in purchase  orders as of December  31,
2005. All outstanding purchase orders as of December 31, 2006 are expected to be
shipped  prior to December 31, 2007.  These  purchase  orders are for the future
delivery of products and are subject to cancellation by the customers.

<b>Customers</b>

     Blonder  Tongue  has a broad  customer  base,  which in 2006  consisted  of
approximately  557  active  accounts.  Approximately  50%,  48%,  and 39% of the
Company&#146;s  revenues in fiscal years 2006,  2005,  and 2004,  respectively,  were
derived from sales of products to the Company&#146;s five largest customers. In 2006,
2005 and 2004, sales to Toner Cable Equipment,  Inc. accounted for approximately
20%,  17%  and 18%  respectively  of the  Company&#146;s  revenues.  There  can be no
assurance that any sales to these  entities,  individually  or as a group,  will
reach or exceed  historical  levels in any future period.  However,  the Company
anticipates  that these  customers  will  continue to account for a  significant
portion of the Company&#146;s  revenues in future  periods,  although none of them is
obligated to purchase any specified amount of products or to provide the Company
with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period.

     The  complement  of leading  customers  tends to vary over time as the most
efficient and better  financed  integrators  grow more rapidly than others.  The
Company  believes  that  many  integrators  will grow  rapidly,  and as such the
Company&#146;s success will depend in part on the viability of those customers and on
the  Company&#146;s  ability to maintain its position in the overall  marketplace  by
shifting its  emphasis to those  customers  with the greatest  growth and growth
prospects.  Any  substantial  decrease  or  delay in sales to one or more of the
Company&#146;s leading customers,  the financial failure of any of these entities, or
the Company&#146;s  inability to develop and maintain  solid  relationships  with the
integrators  which may  replace  the  present  leading  customers,  would have a
material  adverse  effect on the Company&#146;s  results of operations  and financial
condition.

     The  Company&#146;s  revenues  are  derived  primarily  from  customers  in  the
continental  United  States,  however,  the Company also derives  revenues  from
customers  outside the continental  United States,  primarily in Canada and to a
more limited extent, in  underdeveloped  countries.  Television  service is less
developed in many international  markets,  particularly  Latin America,  Eastern
Europe, and Asia, creating  opportunity for those participants who offer quality
products at a competitive price. Sales to customers outside of the United States
represented  approximately  6%, 6% and 4% of the  Company&#146;s  revenues  in fiscal
years 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively.  All of the Company&#146;s  transactions with
customers  located outside of the  continental  United States are denominated in
U.S.  dollars,   therefore,   the  Company  has  no  material  foreign  currency
transactions.  In connection with the Company&#146;s  anticipated  initiatives in the
PRC, the Company may have foreign  currency  transactions  and may be subject to
various currency  exchange  control programs related to its PRC operations.  See
Risk Factors below for more detail on the risk of foreign operations.

<b>Manufacturing and Suppliers</b>

     Blonder  Tongue&#146;s  manufacturing  operations  are presently  located at the
Company&#146;s  headquarters in Old Bridge, New Jersey.  The Company&#146;s  manufacturing
operations are vertically integrated and consist principally of the assembly and
testing of electronic  assemblies built from fabricated  parts,  printed circuit
boards  and  electronic  devices  and the  fabrication  from raw sheet  metal of
chassis and cabinets for such  assemblies.  Management  continues to implement a
significant  number  of  changes  to  the  manufacturing   process  to  increase
production volume and reduce product cost, including logistics  modifications on



                                       10



the factory floor, an increased use of surface mount, axial lead and radial lead
robotics to place electronic  components on printed circuit boards, a continuing
program of circuit board redesign to make more products  compatible with robotic
insertion  equipment and an increased  integration in machining and fabrication.
All of these efforts are consistent  with and part of the Company&#146;s  strategy to
provide its customers with high performance-to-cost  ratio products. The Company
has  also  entered  into  a  manufacturing   agreement  with  a  major  contract
manufacturer  in the PRC that  would  govern  the  terms of its  manufacture  of
certain of the Company&#146;s high volume and complex  products upon a purchase order
being  submitted  by the  Company.  The Company is also  negotiating  with other
PRC-based  contract  manufacturers  with respect to other products.  The Company
expects to commence  production  of certain  products in the PRC during 2007. If
successful,  the  Company  may shift a  material  portion  of its  manufacturing
operations  to the  PRC in  order  to  maximize  manufacturing  and  operational
efficiencies.

     Outside contractors supply standard components, etch-printed circuit boards
and electronic subassemblies to the Company&#146;s specifications.  While the Company
generally purchases electronic parts which do not have a unique source,  certain
electronic component parts used within the Company&#146;s products are available from
a limited number of suppliers and can be subject to temporary  shortages because
of general  economic  conditions  and the  demand and supply for such  component
parts.  If the Company  were to  experience  a  temporary  shortage of any given
electronic part, the Company  believes that alternative  parts could be obtained
or system design changes  implemented.  However,  in such situations the Company
may experience  temporary reductions in its ability to ship products affected by
the component  shortage.  On an as-needed basis, the Company  purchases  several
products from sole  suppliers for which  alternative  sources are not available,
such as the DigiCipher(R)encryption  systems manufactured by Motorola, which are
standard   encryption   methodologies   employed  on  U.S.  C-Band  and  Ku-Band
transponders,  EchoStar  digital  receivers  for  delivery  of DISH  Network(TM)
programming,   and  Hughes   digital   satellite   receivers   for  delivery  of
DIRECTV(TM)programming.  An inability to timely obtain sufficient  quantities of
certain  of  these  components  would  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the
Company&#146;s  operating  results.  The Company does not have an agreement  with any
sole source  supplier  requiring  the  supplier  to sell a  specified  volume of
components to the Company.

     Blonder Tongue maintains a quality assurance program which tests samples of
component  parts  purchased,  as well as its  finished  products,  on an ongoing
basis. The Company also tests component and sub-assembly  boards  throughout the
manufacturing  process using  commercially  available and in-house built testing
systems that incorporate  proprietary  procedures.  The highest level of quality
assurance is maintained  through out all aspects of the design and manufacturing
process because of the in-house calibration  program.  This program ensures that
all test and measurement  equipment that is used in the manufacturing process is
calibrated to the same in-house  reference  standard on a consistent basis. When
all test and  measurement  devices are calibrated in this manner,  discrepancies
are  eliminated  between the  engineering,  manufacturing,  and quality  control
departments, thus increasing operational efficiency and ensuring a high level of
product  quality.  Blonder Tongue performs final product tests prior to shipment
to customers.

<b>Competition</b>

     All aspects of the Company&#146;s business are highly  competitive.  The Company
competes  with  national,  regional and local  manufacturers  and  distributors,
including companies larger than Blonder Tongue which have substantially  greater
resources.  Various manufacturers who are suppliers to the Company sell directly
as  well  as  through   distributors   into  the  franchise  and  private  cable
marketplaces.  Because of the convergence of the cable,  telecommunications  and
computer  industries and rapid  technological  development,  new competitors may
seek to  enter  the  principal  markets  served  by the  Company.  Many of these
potential   competitors  have  significantly   greater   financial,   technical,
manufacturing,  marketing,  sales and other resources than Blonder  Tongue.  The
Company  expects  that  direct and  indirect  competition  will  increase in the
future. Additional competition could result in price reductions,  loss of market
share and delays in the timing of  customer  orders.  The  principal  methods of
competition are product  differentiation,  performance,  quality,  price, terms,
service,  technical support and administrative  support. The Company believes it
differentiates  itself from  competitors  by  continuously  offering  innovative
products,  providing  excellent  technical service support and delivering a high
performance-to-cost ratio.

<b>Intellectual Property</b>

     The Company  currently holds 11 United States patents and 4 foreign patents
none of which  are  considered  material  to the  Company&#146;s  present  operations
because they do not relate to high volume  applications.  In December  2006, the
Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary,  Blonder Tongue Investment Company, completed
the  sale  to  Moonbeam  L.L.C.  of a  portfolio  of  selected  patents,  patent
applications,  provisional  patent  applications and related foreign patents and
applications  ("<b>Patents</b>")  originally  acquired in the Company&#146;s  acquisition of
Scientific-Atlanta,   Inc.&#146;s  interdiction  business  in  1998.  Blonder  Tongue



                                       11



retained a non-exclusive, royalty free, non-sublicenseable,  worldwide right and
license to use the  Patents to  continue to  develop,  manufacture,  use,  sell,
distribute  and  otherwise  exploit  all of  the  Company&#146;s  products  currently
protected under the Patents. Because of the rapidly evolving nature of the cable
television industry, the Company believes that its market position as a supplier
to cable integrators  derives primarily from its ability to develop a continuous
stream of new products which are designed to meet its customers&#146; needs and which
have a high performance-to-cost ratio.

     The Company has a registered trademark on "Blonder Tongue(R)" and also on a
"BT(R)" logo. In connection with the transactions  pursuant to which the Company
acquired an  ownership  interest in NetLinc and BTT,  the Company  granted BTT a
non-exclusive,  revocable and  royalty-free  license to use these trademarks and
certain  variations  of such names.  This license was  terminated as part of the
2006 transaction in which the Company divested its interest in BTT.

     The Company is a licensee of Philips  Electronics North America Corporation
and its  affiliate,  Philips  Broadband  Networks,  Inc.,  Motorola,  Hughes and
several smaller software development companies.

     Under  the   Philips   License   Agreements,   the  Company  is  granted  a
non-exclusive  license for a term which expires in 2010,  concurrently  with the
last to expire of the relevant patents.  The Philips License  Agreements provide
for the payment by the Company of a one-time  license fee and for the payment by
the Company of royalties based upon unit sales of licensed products.

     The   Company  is  a  licensee   of   Motorola   relating   to   Motorola&#146;s
VideoCipher(R)encryption  technology  and is also a  party  to a  private  label
agreement  with  Motorola  relating  to its  DigiCipher(R)technology.  Under the
VideoCipher(R)license  agreement, the Company is granted a non-exclusive license
under certain proprietary  know-how,  to design and manufacture certain licensed
products to be compatible with the VideoCipher(R)commercial  descrambler module.
The VideoCipher(R)license agreement provides for the payment by the Company of a
one-time  license fee for the  Company&#146;s  first  model of  licensed  product and
additional  one-time license fees for each additional model of licensed product.
The VideoCipher(R)license agreement also provides for the payment by the Company
of   royalties   based  upon  unit  sales  of  licensed   products.   Under  the
DigiCipher(R)private  label agreement,  the Company is granted the non-exclusive
right to sell  DigiCipher(R)II  integrated receiver decoders bearing the Blonder
Tongue name for use in the commercial  market.  The  DigiCipher(R)private  label
agreement  provides for the payment by the Company of a one-time license fee for
the Company&#146;s first model of licensed  product and additional  one-time  license
fees for each additional model of licensed product.

     During 1996,  the Company  entered into several  software  development  and
license agreements for specifically  designed  controller and interface software
necessary   for  the  operation  of  the   Company&#146;s   Video   Central(TM)remote
interdiction   control   system,   which  is  used  for  remote   operation   of
VideoMask(TM)signal  jammers installed at subscriber  locations.  These licenses
are perpetual and require the payment of a one-time  license fee and in one case
additional payments, the aggregate of which are not material.

     The Company relies on a combination of contractual  rights and trade secret
laws to protect  its  proprietary  technologies  and  know-how.  There can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to protect its technologies and know-how
or that third  parties  will not be able to  develop  similar  technologies  and
know-how  independently.  Therefore,  existing and potential  competitors may be
able to develop  products that are competitive  with the Company&#146;s  products and
such competition could adversely affect the prices for the Company&#146;s products or
the Company&#146;s  market share.  The Company also believes that factors such as the
technological  and creative skills of its personnel,  new product  developments,
frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance
are essential to establishing and maintaining its competitive position.

<b>Regulation</b>

     Private  cable,  while in some  cases  subject  to  certain  FCC  licensing
requirements,  is not presently burdened with extensive government  regulations.
Franchise  cable operators had been subject to extensive  government  regulation
pursuant to the Cable  Television  Consumer  Protection and  Competition  Act of
1992,  which among other things provided for rate rollbacks for basic tier cable
service,  further rate reductions under certain circumstances and limitations on
future rate  increases.  The  Telecommunications  Act of 1996  deregulated  many
aspects of franchise  cable system  operation and opened the door to competition
among  cable  operators  and  telephone  companies  in each of their  respective
industries.



                                       12



     In June,  2000,  the FCC adopted and issued a Final Rule and Order relating
to the re-designation of portions of the 18GHz-frequency  band among the various
currently allocated services.  The Final Rules regarding this issue provided for
the  grandfathering,  for  a  period  of  ten  years,  of  certain  pre-existing
(installed)  terrestrial  fixed service  operators  ("<b>TFSOs</b>") and TFSOs that had
made  application  for a license prior to a certain date. In November  2002, the
FCC  issued a Second  Order  on  Reconsideration  (the  "<b>Second  Order</b>"),  which
redefined the use of the 18 GHz microwave band. As a result of the Second Order,
the Company&#146;s existing microwave inventory would have to be modified to function
within  the new  frequency  band.  In  addition,  on  April  19,  2004,  the FCC
International Bureau released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  ("<b>NPRM</b>"),  Docket
04-143, which among other things,  proposes channelization changes for the 18GHz
band to further reduce the usable band. The  uncertainty  associated  with these
regulatory  issues,  coupled with the  expanding use of fiber optic cable due to
its inherently  superior  bandwidth,  have resulted in a significant  shift away
from microwave  products.  These  products are not  anticipated to be a material
portion of the Company&#146;s future sales.

<b>Environmental Regulations</b>

     The  Company  is  subject  to  a  variety  of  Federal,   state  and  local
governmental  regulations related to the storage, use, discharge and disposal of
toxic,  volatile or  otherwise  hazardous  chemicals  used in its  manufacturing
processes.  The Company did not incur in 2006 and does not anticipate  incurring
in 2007 material  capital  expenditures  for compliance with Federal,  state and
local  environmental laws and regulations.  There can be no assurance,  however,
that  changes  in  environmental  regulations  will not  result  in the need for
additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens
on the Company.  Further,  such regulations could restrict the Company&#146;s ability
to expand its operations.  Any failure by the Company to obtain required permits
for,  control the use of, or adequately  restrict the  discharge  of,  hazardous
substances  under  present or future  regulations  could  subject the Company to
substantial  liability  or  could  cause  its  manufacturing  operations  to  be
suspended.

     The  Company  presently  holds a permit from the New Jersey  Department  of
Environmental  Protection  ("<b>NJDEP</b>"),  Division of  Environmental  Quality,  Air
Pollution   Control  Program  relating  to  its  operation  of  certain  process
equipment, which permit expires in May, 2007. The Company has held such a permit
for this  equipment  on a  substantially  continuous  basis since  approximately
April,  1989. The Company also has authorization  under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge  Elimination  System/Discharge  to Surface Waters  General  Industrial
Stormwater Permit, Permit No. NJ0088315. This permit will expire May 31, 2007.

<b>Employees</b>

     As of March 16,  2007,  the  Company  employed  approximately  250  people,
including 174 in  manufacturing,  15 in research and development,  11 in quality
assurance,  30 in sales and  marketing,  and 20 in a general and  administrative
capacity.  105 of the  Company&#146;s  employees  are  members  of the  International
Brotherhood  of Electrical  Workers  Union,  Local 2066,  which has a three year
labor  agreement  with the  Company  expiring  in  February,  2009.  The Company
considers its relations with its employees to be good.



<b>ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS</b>

     The Company&#146;s  business  operates in a rapidly  changing  environment  that
involves  numerous risks,  some of which are beyond the Company&#146;s  control.  The
following "Risk Factors"  highlights some of these risks.  Additional  risks not
currently known to the Company or that the Company now deems immaterial may also
affect the Company and the value of its common stock. The risks described below,
together with all of the other  information  included in this report,  should be
carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects. The occurrence of
any  of the  following  risks  could  harm  the  Company&#146;s  business,  financial
condition or results of  operations.  Solely for purposes of the risk factors in
this  Item  1A,  the  terms  "we",  "our"  and  "us"  refer  to  Blonder  Tongue
Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

<b>Any substantial  decrease in sales to our largest  customer may adversely affect
our results of operations or financial condition.</b>

     In 2006, 2005 and 2004, sales to Toner Cable Equipment,  Inc. accounted for
approximately 20%, 17% and 18%, respectively,  of our revenues.  There can be no



                                       13



assurance that any sales to this customer will reach or exceed historical levels
in any future period. However, we anticipate that this customer will continue to
account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods, although it
is  not  obligated  to  purchase  any  specified   amount  of  products  (beyond
outstanding  purchase orders) or to provide us with binding forecasts of product
purchases for any future period.

     The  complement  of leading  customers  tends to vary over time as the most
efficient  and  better-financed  integrators  grow more rapidly than others.  We
believe that many integrators will grow rapidly,  and, as such, our success will
depend in part on:

     o    the viability of those customers;

     o    our ability to identify those  customers with the greatest  growth and
          growth prospects; and

     o    our ability to maintain  our  position in the overall  marketplace  by
          shifting our emphasis to such customers.

     Any  substantial  decrease  or delay in sales to one or more of our leading
customers,  the financial failure of any of these entities,  or our inability to
develop solid  relationships  with the integrators which may replace the present
leading  customers,  could  have a  material  adverse  effect on our  results of
operations and financial condition.

<b>An inability to reduce  expenses or increase of revenues may cause continued net
losses.</b>

     We have had net losses  from  continuing  operations  each year since 2002.
While  management  believes its plans to reduce  expenses and increase  revenues
will return us to  profitability,  there can be no assurance  that these actions
will be successful. Failure to reduce expenses or increase revenues could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

<b>A significant  increase to inventory  reserves due to  inadequate  reserves in a
prior period or to an increase in excess or obsolete  inventories  may adversely
affect our results of operations and financial condition.</b>

     We continually  analyze our slow-moving,  excess and obsolete  inventories.
Based on historical and projected sales volumes and anticipated  selling prices,
we establish reserves. If we do not meet our sales expectations,  these reserves
are  increased.  Products that are determined to be obsolete are written down to
net  realizable  value.  We recorded  an  increase  to our reserve of  $114,000,
$4,372,000 and $872,000  during 2006, 2005 and 2004,  respectively.  Although we
believe  reserves are adequate and  inventories  are reflected at net realizable
value,  there can be no  assurance  that we will not have to  record  additional
inventory  reserves in the future.  Significant  increases to inventory reserves
could have a material  adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

<b>An  inability  to  develop,  or acquire the rights to,  technology,  products or
applications in response to changes in industry  standards or customer needs may
reduce our sales and profitability.</b>

     Both the private cable and franchised cable industries are characterized by
the  continuing  advancement  of  technology,  evolving  industry  standards and
changing  customer needs. To be successful,  we must anticipate the evolution of
industry standards and changes in customer needs, through the timely development
and introduction of new products, enhancement of existing products and licensing
of new technology  from third parties.  Although we depend  primarily on our own
research and development efforts to develop new products and enhancements to our
existing products,  we have and may continue to seek licenses for new technology
from third  parties  when we believe  that we can obtain  such  technology  more
quickly and/or  cost-effectively from such third parties than we could otherwise
develop on our own, or when the desired  technology has already been patented by
a third party.  There can, however,  be no assurance that new technology or such
licenses will be available on terms  acceptable to us. There can be no assurance
that:

     o    we will be able to anticipate  the evolution of industry  standards in
          the cable television or the communications industry generally;

     o    we will be able to  anticipate  changes  in the  market  and  customer
          needs;



                                       14



     o    technologies  and  applications   under  development  by  us  will  be
          successfully developed; or

     o    successfully  developed  technologies  and  applications  will achieve
          market acceptance.

     If we are  unable  for  technological  or  other  reasons  to  develop  and
introduce  products and  applications or to obtain licenses for new technologies
from third parties in a timely manner in response to changing market  conditions
or customer  requirements,  our results of operations  and  financial  condition
would be materially adversely affected.

<b>Anticipated  increases  in direct and indirect  competition  with us may have an
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.</b>

     All  aspects of our  business  are  highly  competitive.  We  compete  with
national, regional and local manufacturers and distributors, including companies
larger  than  us,   which  have   substantially   greater   resources.   Various
manufacturers  who  are  suppliers  to us  sell  directly  as  well  as  through
distributors into the cable television  marketplace.  Because of the convergence
of the cable, telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological
development,  new competitors may seek to enter the principal  markets served by
us. Many of these potential  competitors have  significantly  greater financial,
technical, manufacturing,  marketing, sales and other resources than we have. We
expect  that  direct and  indirect  competition  will  increase  in the  future.
Additional  competition  could have a material  adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition through:

     o    price reductions;

     o    loss of market share;

     o    delays in the timing of customer orders; and

     o    an  inability to increase our  penetration  into the cable  television
          market.

<b>Our sales and profitability may suffer due to any substantial  decrease or delay
in capital spending by the cable  infrastructure  operators that we serve in the
MDU, lodging and institutional cable markets.</b>

     The vast majority of our revenues in fiscal years 2006,  2005 and 2004 came
from sales of our products for use by cable infrastructure operators. Demand for
our products  depends to a large extent upon capital  spending on private  cable
systems  and   specifically  by  private  cable   operators  for   constructing,
rebuilding,  maintaining or upgrading their systems. Capital spending by private
cable operators and, therefore, our sales and profitability,  are dependent on a
variety of factors, including

     o    access  by  private   cable   operators  to   financing   for  capital
          expenditures;

     o    demand for their cable services;

     o    availability of alternative video delivery technologies; and

     o    general economic conditions.

     In  addition,  our  sales  and  profitability  may in the  future  be  more
dependent on capital spending by traditional franchise cable system operators as
well as by new entrants to this market  planning to  over-build  existing  cable
system infrastructures,  or constructing,  rebuilding, maintaining and upgrading
their systems.  There can be no assurance that system operators in private cable
or franchise cable will continue capital spending for constructing,  rebuilding,
maintaining,  or upgrading their systems.  Any substantial  decrease or delay in
capital  spending by private  cable or franchise  cable  operators  would have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.



                                       15





<b>Any significant  casualty to our facility in Old Bridge,  New Jersey may cause a
lengthy interruption to our business operations.</b>

     We operate out of one manufacturing facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey (the
"<b>Old  Bridge  Facility</b>").  While  we  maintain  a  limited  amount  of  business
interruption insurance, a casualty that results in a lengthy interruption of the
ability to manufacture at, or otherwise use, that facility would have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

<b>Our dependence on certain third party suppliers could create an inability for us
to  obtain  component  products  not  otherwise  available  or to do so  only at
increased prices.</b>

     We purchase  several  products from sole  suppliers  for which  alternative
sources are not  available,  such as certain  components of  EchoStar&#146;s  digital
satellite  receiver decoders,  which are specifically  designed to work with the
DISH  Network(TM),  and certain  components of Hughes  Network  Systems  digital



                                       15



satellite  receivers  which are  specifically  designed to work with  DIRECTV(R)
programming.  Our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  could  be
materially adversely affected by:

     o    an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components;

     o    our receipt of a significant number of defective components;

     o    an increase in component prices; or

     o    our  inability  to  obtain  lower  component  prices  in  response  to
          competitive pressures on the pricing of our products.

<b>Our existing and proposed  international  sales and operations subject us to the
risks of  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  changes  in  foreign
telecommunications  standards, and unfavorable political,  regulatory, labor and
tax conditions in other countries.</b>

     Sales to customers outside of the United States  represented  approximately
6%, 6% and 4% of our revenues in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Such sales are subject to certain risks such as:

     o    changes  in  foreign  government  regulations  and  telecommunications
          standards;

     o    export license requirements;

     o    tariffs and taxes;

     o    other trade barriers;

     o    capital and exchange control programs;

     o    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

     o    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and

     o    political and economic instability.

     Fluctuations in currency  exchange rates could cause our products to become
relatively  more  expensive to customers in a particular  country,  leading to a
reduction in sales or profitability  in that country.  There can be no assurance
that  sales to  customers  outside  the  United  States  will  reach  or  exceed
historical levels in the future, or that international  markets will continue to
develop or that we will receive additional  contracts to supply our products for
use in systems and equipment in international markets. Our results of operations
and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected if international
markets do not  continue to develop,  we do not  continue to receive  additional
contracts  to  supply  our  products  for  use  in  systems  and   equipment  in
international markets or our international sales are affected by the other risks
of international operations.



                                       16



<b>Our anticipated contract manufacturing in the PRC may subject us to the risks of
unfavorable political, regulatory, legal and labor conditions in the PRC.</b>

     During  the  second  half of 2007,  we  expect to begin  manufacturing  and
assembling some of our products in the People&#146;s Republic of China, or PRC, under
contract manufacturing  arrangements with certain key Chinese manufacturers.  In
addition,  we may  increase  the  amount of  revenues  we derive  from  sales to
customers  outside the United  States,  including  sales in the PRC.  Our future
operations  and earnings may be adversely  affected by the risks  related to, or
any other problems  arising from,  having our products  manufactured in the PRC,
including those risks  described in the preceding risk factor.  Although the PRC
has a large and growing economy,  its potential economic,  political,  legal and
labor developments  entail  uncertainties and risks. In the event of any changes
that adversely  affect our ability to manufacture in the PRC after products have
been  successfully  transitioned  out of the United  States,  our business  will
suffer.


<b>Shifting our operations between regions may entail considerable expense.</b>

     Over time we may shift a material portion of our  manufacturing  operations
to the PRC in order to maximize manufacturing and operational  efficiency.  This
could result in reducing our domestic  operations  in the future,  which in turn
could entail  significant  one-time  earnings  charges to account for severance,
equipment write-offs or write downs and moving expenses.


Competitors  may develop  products  that are similar to, and compete  with,  our
products due to our limited proprietary protection.

     We possess limited patent or registered  intellectual  property rights with
respect to our  technology.  We rely on a combination of contractual  rights and
trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology and know-how.  There can
be no assurance  that we will be able to protect our  technology and know-how or
that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently.
Therefore,  existing and potential  competitors  may be able to develop  similar
products  which  compete with our products.  Such  competition  could  adversely
affect the prices for our products or our market share and could have a material
adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition.

<b>Patent  infringement  claims  against  us  or  our  customers,  whether  or  not
successful, may cause us to incur significant costs.</b>

     While  we  do  not  believe  that  our  products  (including  products  and
technologies  licensed from others) infringe the proprietary rights of any third
parties,  there can be no assurance that  infringement or invalidity  claims (or
claims for  indemnification  resulting  from  infringement  claims)  will not be
asserted  against us or our  customers.  Damages  for  violation  of third party
proprietary rights could be substantial,  in some instances damages are trebled,
and could have a material  adverse effect on the Company&#146;s  financial  condition
and results of operation. Regardless of the validity or the successful assertion
of any such claims,  we would incur significant costs and diversion of resources
with respect to the defense  thereof which could have a material  adverse effect
on our financial condition and results of operations.  If we are unsuccessful in
defending any claims or actions that are asserted  against us or our  customers,
we may seek to  obtain a license  under a third  party&#146;s  intellectual  property
rights.  There can be no assurance,  however,  that under such circumstances,  a
license  would be  available  under  reasonable  terms or at all. The failure to
obtain a license to a third party&#146;s intellectual property rights on commercially
reasonable  terms  could  have a  material  adverse  effect  on our  results  of
operations and financial condition.

     <b>Any increase in governmental regulation of the cable markets that we serve,
including the MDU, lodging and institutional markets, may have an adverse effect
on our results of operations and financial condition.</b>

     The MDU, lodging and institutional markets within the cable industry, which
represents  the vast  majority of our  business,  while in some cases subject to
certain FCC licensing  requirements,  is not presently  burdened with  extensive
government  regulations.  It is possible,  however,  that  regulations  could be
adopted  in the future  which  impose  burdensome  restrictions  on these  cable
markets  resulting  in,  among  other  things,  barriers  to  the  entry  of new
competitors or limitations on capital  expenditures.  Any such  regulations,  if
adopted,  could have a material  adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition.

     Operators in the  franchise  cable  market,  which  represents a relatively
small  percentage  of our  business,  had been subject to  extensive  government
regulation  pursuant to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992, which among other things provided for rate rollbacks for basic tier
cable  service,   further  rate  reductions  under  certain   circumstances  and
limitations on future rate  increases.  The  Telecommunications  Act of 1996 has
deregulated  many aspects of franchise cable system operation and has opened the
door to  competition  among cable  operators and telephone  companies in each of
their respective industries. It is possible,  however, that regulations could be
adopted  which  would  re-impose  burdensome  restrictions  on  franchise  cable
operators  resulting  in, among other things,  the grant of exclusive  rights or
franchises within certain geographical areas. In addition, certain rules adopted
by the FCC in June,  2000 (as further  revised in 2002 and 2004) provide for the
re-designation  of  portions  of the  18GHz-frequency  band  among  the  various
currently  allocated  services,  which rules have  shifted  demand away from our
microwave  products.  Any increased  regulation of franchise  cable could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

<b>Any  increase in  governmental  environmental  regulations  or our  inability or
failure to comply with existing  environmental  regulations may cause an adverse
effect on our results of operations or financial condition.</b>

     We are  subject  to a variety  of  federal,  state  and local  governmental
regulations  related to the  storage,  use,  discharge  and  disposal  of toxic,
volatile or otherwise hazardous  chemicals used in our manufacturing  processes.
We do not anticipate material capital expenditures during the fiscal year ending
2007 for  compliance  with  federal,  state  and  local  environmental  laws and
regulations.  There can be no assurance,  however, that changes in environmental
regulations will not result in the need for additional  capital  expenditures or
otherwise impose additional  financial burdens on us. Further,  such regulations
could restrict our ability to expand our operations. Any failure by us to obtain
required permits for,  control the use of, or adequately  restrict the discharge
of, hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to
substantial  liability  or  could  cause  our  manufacturing  operations  to  be
suspended. Such liability or suspension of manufacturing operations could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

<b>Losing the services of our executive  officers or our other highly qualified and
experienced employees, or our inability to continue to attract and retain highly
qualified and experienced employees, could adversely affect our business.</b>

     Our future  success  depends in large part on the continued  service of our
key  executives  and  technical and  management  personnel,  including  James A.
Luksch,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  and Robert J.  Palle,  President  and Chief
Operating Officer.  We maintain and are the beneficiary of $1,000,000 of key man
life  insurance on each of Mr.  Luksch and Mr.  Palle.  Our future  success also
depends  on our  ability  to  continue  to attract  and  retain  highly  skilled
engineering,  manufacturing, marketing and managerial personnel. The competition
for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees,  in particular the
principal  members of our management and technical staff,  could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

<b>Our  organizational  documents and Delaware  state law contain  provisions  that
could  discourage  or prevent a  potential  takeover or change in control of our
company or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of
our Common Stock.</b>

     Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of
undesignated  Preferred  Stock, to determine the powers,  preferences and rights
and the qualifications,  limitations or restrictions  granted to or imposed upon
any unissued  series of  undesignated  Preferred  Stock and to fix the number of
shares  constituting any series and the designation of such series,  without any
further vote or action by our stockholders.  The Preferred Stock could be issued
with voting,  liquidation,  dividend and other rights  superior to the rights of
the Common  Stock.  Furthermore,  such  Preferred  Stock may have other  rights,
including  economic  rights,  senior to the Common Stock,  and as a result,  the
issuance of such stock could have a material  adverse effect on the market value
of the Common Stock. In addition, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation:

     o    eliminates the right of our stockholders to act without a meeting;

     o    does not provide cumulative voting for the election of directors;

     o    does not  provide  our  stockholders  with the  right to call  special
          meetings;



                                       18



     o    provides for a classified board of directors; and

     o    imposes various procedural  requirements which could make it difficult
          for our stockholders to affect certain corporate actions.

     These  provisions and the Board&#146;s ability to issue Preferred Stock may have
the effect of  deterring  hostile  takeovers  or offers  from  third  parties to
acquire our company,  preventing our  stockholders  from receiving a premium for
their shares of our Common Stock,  or delaying or preventing  changes in control
or management of our company. We are also afforded the protection of Section 203
of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could:

     o    delay or prevent a change in control of our company;

     o    impede a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving
          us; or

     o    discourage  a  potential  acquirer  from  making  a  tender  offer  or
          otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.

     Any of these provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing
a change in control of our  company or could have a material  adverse  effect on
the market value of our Common Stock.

<b>It is unlikely that we will pay dividends on our Common Stock.</b>

     We intend to retain all  earnings to finance the growth of our business and
therefore do not intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the  foreseeable
future.  Moreover,  our  loan  agreement  with  National  City  Business  Credit
prohibits the payment of cash dividends by us on our Common Stock.

<b>Potential  fluctuations  in the stock price for our Common  Stock may  adversely
affect the market price for our Common Stock.</b>

     Factors such as:

     o    announcements of technological  innovations or new products by us, our
          competitors or third parties;

     o    quarterly   variations  in  our  actual  or  anticipated   results  of
          operations;

     o    failure of revenues or earnings in any quarter to meet the  investment
          community&#146;s expectations; and

     o    market conditions for cable industry stocks in general;

may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate  significantly.  The
stock price may also be  affected  by broader  market  trends  unrelated  to our
performance.  These  fluctuations  may adversely  affect the market price of our
Common Stock.

<b>Delays or  difficulties  in  negotiating a labor  agreement may cause an adverse
effect on our manufacturing and business operations.</b>

     All of  our  direct  labor  employees  are  members  of  the  International
Brotherhood  of  Electrical  Workers  Union,  Local  2066,  under  a  collective
bargaining agreement,  which expires in February 2009. Delays or difficulties in
negotiating  and executing a new agreement,  which may result in work stoppages,
could have a material  adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

<b>ITEM 2. PROPERTIES</b>

     The   Company&#146;s   principal   manufacturing,    engineering,    sales   and
administrative facilities consist of one building totaling approximately 130,000
square feet located on approximately 20 acres of land in Old Bridge,  New Jersey



                                       19




(the  "<b>Old  Bridge  Facility</b>")  which is owned by the  Company.  The Old  Bridge
Facility is encumbered by a mortgage held by National City Business Credit, Inc.
in the  principal  amount of  $1,767,000  as of December  31,  2006.  Management
believes  that the Old Bridge  Facility is  adequate  to support  the  Company&#146;s
anticipated needs in 2007.

<b>ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</b>

     The Company is a party to certain  proceedings  incidental  to the ordinary
course of its business, none of which, in the current opinion of management,  is
likely to have a material  adverse effect on the Company&#146;s  business,  financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

<b>ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS</b>

No  matters  were  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders  during the fourth
quarter  ended  December  31,  2006,  through  the  solicitation  of  proxies or
otherwise.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT&#146;S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS</b>

     The Company&#146;s  common stock has been traded on the American  Stock Exchange
since the Company&#146;s  initial public offering on December 14, 1995. The following
table sets forth for the fiscal quarters indicated, the high and low sale prices
for the Company&#146;s Common Stock on the American Stock Exchange.

     The Company&#146;s  Common Stock is traded on the American  Stock Exchange under
the symbol "BDR".

<b>Holders</b>

     As of March 28, 2007, the Company had approximately 58 holders of record of
the Common  Stock.  Since a portion  of the  Company&#146;s  common  stock is held in
"street" or nominee name, the Company is unable to determine the exact number of
beneficial holders.

<b>Dividends</b>

     The Company  currently  anticipates that it will retain all of its earnings
to finance the operation and expansion of its business,  and therefore  does not
intend to pay dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Since its
initial  public  offering,  the  Company  has  never  declared  or paid any cash
dividends on its Common Stock. Any  determination to pay dividends in the future
is at the  discretion of the  Company&#146;s  Board of Directors and will depend upon



                                       20



the Company&#146;s financial condition, results of operations,  capital requirements,
limitations  contained in loan agreements and such other factors as the Board of
Directors  deems  relevant.  The Company&#146;s  credit  agreement with National City
Business Credit,  Inc. prohibits the payment of cash dividends by the Company on
its Common Stock.

(1)  On November 14, 2006, the Company purchased  1,293,154 shares of its Common
     Stock in a private off-market block transaction from a former director, who
     was at the time the Company&#146;s largest shareholder.

(2)  In July 2002, the Company commenced an on-going stock repurchase program to
     acquire up to $300,000  worth of its  outstanding  common  stock (the "2002
     Plan").  The  Company did not  repurchase  any of its Common  Stock  during
     fiscal  year  2006  under  the 2002 Plan and as of  December  31,  2006 the
     Company can purchase an  additional  $100,000 of its common stock under the
     2002  Plan.  On  February  13,  2007,  the  Company  announced  a new stock
     repurchase  program to acquire up to an  additional  100,000  shares of its
     outstanding  common stock (the "2007 Plan").  The Company intends to resume
     making  purchases  under the 2002 Plan up to its limits,  and thereafter to
     make purchases under the 2007 Plan.

<b>ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
     OF OPERATIONS</b>

     <i>The following  discussion and analysis of the Company&#146;s  historical results
of operations and liquidity and capital  resources should be read in conjunction
with  "Selected  Consolidated  Financial  Data" and the  consolidated  financial
statements  of the Company and notes thereto  appearing  elsewhere  herein.  The
following discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking  statements that
involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from
those  anticipated  in these  forward-looking  statements as a result of various
factors. See "Forward Looking Statements" that precedes Item 1 above.</i>

<b>Overview</b>

     The Company was incorporated in November,  1988, under the laws of Delaware
as  GPS  Acquisition  Corp.  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring  the  business  of
Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc., a New Jersey corporation which was founded in
1950 by Ben H. Tongue and Isaac S. Blonder to design,  manufacture  and supply a
line of  electronics  and systems  equipment  principally  for the Private Cable
industry.  Following the  acquisition,  the Company  changed its name to Blonder
Tongue  Laboratories,  Inc. The Company completed the initial public offering of
its shares of Common Stock in December, 1995.

     The Company is  principally  a  designer,  manufacturer  and  supplier of a
comprehensive line of electronics and systems equipment, primarily for the cable
television industry (both franchise and private cable). Over the past few years,
the Company has also  introduced  equipment  and  innovative  solutions  for the
high-speed  transmission  of data and the  provision  of  telephony  services in
multiple dwelling unit applications. The Company&#146;s products are used to acquire,
distribute  and  protect the broad range of  communications  signals  carried on
fiber optic,  twisted  pair,  coaxial cable and wireless  distribution  systems.
These  products  are sold to  customers  providing  an  array of  communications
services,  including  television,  high-speed data (Internet) and telephony,  to
single family dwellings,  multiple dwelling units ("<b>MDUs</b>"), the lodging industry
and institutions such as hospitals, prisons, schools and marinas. The  Company&#146;s
principal customers  are cable  system  operators  (both  franchise  and private
cable),  as  well as  contractors  that  design,  package,  install  and in most
instances  operate,  upgrade  and  maintain  the systems  they build,  including
institutional and lodging/hospitality operators.

     A key  component of the  Company&#146;s  strategy is to leverage its  reputation
across a broad product line, offering one-stop shop convenience to private cable
and franchise  cable system  operators  and  delivering  products  having a high
performance-to-cost  ratio.  The Company  continues  to expand its core  product
lines (headend and distribution),  to maintain its ability to provide all of the
electronic  equipment  necessary  to build small  cable  systems and much of the
equipment needed in larger systems for the most efficient  operation and highest
profitability  in high density  applications.  The Company has also divested its
interests in certain  non-core  business as part of its strategy to focus on the
efficient operation of its core businesses.

     Over the past several years,  the Company expanded beyond its core business
by acquiring a private cable  television  system (BDR  Broadband,  LLC).  During
2003,  the Company  also  acquired  an interest in a company  offering a private
telephone  program for  multiple  dwelling  unit  applications  (Blonder  Tongue
Telephone, LLC). However, as part of its strategy to focus on its core business,
the Company sold its interests in these  businesses  during 2006. The results of
operations  from BDR  Broadband,  LLC, as well as the gain due to its sale,  are
reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations
included  in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K.  These  acquisitions  and related
dispositions  are  described  in more  detail  below,  along with  other  recent
transactions affecting the Company in recent years.

     On  December  15,  2006,  the  Company   completed  the  divesture  of  its
wholly-owned  subsidiary,  BDR Broadband, LLC ("<b>BDR</b>") through the sale of all of
the issued and  outstanding  membership  interests of BDR to DirecPath,  a joint
venture  between Hicks  Holdings LLC and The DIRECTV  Group,  Inc. The aggregate
sale price was  approximately  $3.1 million resulting in a gain of approximately
$938,000  on  the  sale,  subject  to  certain  post-closing  adjustments.  This
divestiture  is  expected  to  result in  annualized  savings  of  approximately
$525,000  per year.  The  transaction  included a long-term  equipment  purchase
commitment  from  DirecPath,  pursuant to which a subsidiary of DirectPath  will
purchase   $1,630,000  of  products   from  the  Company,   subject  to  certain
adjustments,  over a period of three (3) years  beginning no later than June 13,
2007. It is also  anticipated  that Blonder  Tongue will provide  DirecPath with
certain systems engineering and technical services.

period of three (3) years  beginning  no later  than June 13,  2007.  It is also
anticipated  that Blonder  Tongue will provide  DirecPath  with certain  systems
engineering and technical services.

     BDR  commenced   operations  in  June  2002,   when  it  acquired   certain
rights-of-entry  for MDU cable  television  and  high-speed  data  systems  (the
"<b>Systems</b>") from Verizon Media Ventures, Inc. and GTE Southwest Incorporated.  At
the time of the divesture, BDR owned Systems for approximately 25 MDU properties
in the State of Texas,  representing  approximately  3,300 MDU cable  television
subscribers  and 8,400  passings.  The loss from operations of BDR was $500,000,
$544,000  and  $379,000  during  2006,  2005 and 2004,  respectively.  While the
Company  continued  to invest in and expand BDR&#146;s  business,  in August 2006 the
Company  determined  to seek a buyer for BDR and exit the  business of operating
Systems  in  Texas  to  allow  the  Company  to  pursue  alternative   strategic
opportunities.  In October 2006, several months prior to the divestiture of BDR,
the Company  acquired the 10% minority  interest that had been owned by Priority
Systems, LLC, for nominal consideration.

     During 2003,  the Company  entered into a series of agreements  pursuant to
which the  Company  ultimately  acquired a 50%  economic  ownership  interest in
NetLinc  Communications,  LLC  ("<b>NetLinc</b>")  and Blonder  Tongue  Telephone,  LLC
("<b>BTT</b>") (to which the Company had licensed  its name).  The  aggregate  purchase
price  consisted of (i) the cash portion of $1,166,667  plus (ii) 500,000 shares
of the Company&#146;s  common stock.  BTT had an obligation to redeem the  $1,166,667
cash  component  of  the  purchase   price  to  the  Company  via   preferential
distributions  of cash flow under  BTT&#146;s  limited  liability  company  operating
agreement.  In addition,  of the 500,000 shares of common stock issued to BTT as
the  non-cash  component  of the  purchase  price (fair  valued at  $1,030,000),
one-half (250,000 shares) were pledged to the Company as collateral.

     Through  its  ownership  interest  in BTT,  the  Company  was  involved  in
providing a  proprietary  telephone  system  suited to MDU  development  and was
entitled  to  receive  incremental  revenues  associated  with  direct  sales of
telephony  products,  however,  revenues  derived  from sales of such  telephony
products and services  were not  material.  NetLinc  owns  patents,  proprietary
technology and know-how for certain  telephony  products that allow  Competitive
Local  Exchange  Carriers  (&#147;<b>CLECs</b>&#148;) to  competitively  provide voice service to
MDUs. While NetLinc&#146;s  intellectual property could be further developed and used
in the future to  manufacture  and sell telephony  products,  the Company has no
present intention to do so.


     On June 30, 2006, the Company  entered into a Share Exchange and Settlement
Agreement  ("<b>Share Exchange  Agreement</b>") with BTT and certain related parties of
BTT,  pursuant to which the Company  transferred to BTT its 49 membership shares
of BTT,  representing the Company&#146;s 50% ownership  interest in BTT. In exchange,
BTT transferred  back to the Company the 500,000 shares of the Company&#146;s  common
stock that were  previously  contributed  by the  Company to the capital of BTT.
Pursuant  to  the  Share  Exchange   Agreement,   the  Company   granted  BTT  a
non-transferable  equipment  purchase credit in the aggregate amount of $400,000
(subject to certain  off-sets),  which was  exercised in full by  September  30,
2006.  The  Company&#146;s  equity  in loss of BTT  was  approximately  approximately
$107,000 and  $437,000  for the fiscal  years ended  December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The Company estimates that the divestiture of these two businesses
(BTT and BDR  Broadband)  should  result  in an  annualized  improvement  to the
Company&#146;s  net income in 2007.  The Company  continues  to hold its  interest in
NetLinc.

     As a  result  of  the  transactions  contemplated  by  the  Share  Exchange
Agreement,  while the Company  presently  intends to  continue to  independently
pursue its existing and hereafter-developed leads for the provision of telephony
services and the sale of telephony equipment,  the Company anticipates that over
the next year, sales derived from this business will not be a significant source
of revenues for the Company.

     On December 14, 2006, the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Blonder Tongue
Investment Company, completed the sale of selected patents, patent applications,
provisional patent  applications and related foreign patents and applications to
Moonbeam L.L.C. for net proceeds of $2,000,000. In connection with the sale, the
Company has retained a non-exclusive,  royalty free, worldwide right and license
to use these patents to continue to develop,  manufacture, use, sell, distribute
and otherwise exploit all of the Company&#146;s  products  currently  protected under
the  patents.  These  products  include  some of the  interdiction  lines in the
Addressable  Subscriber  category of  equipment,  some of which were part of the
interdiction business acquired from  Scientific-Atlanta,  Inc. ("<b>Scientific</b>") in
1998.



                                       25



     One of the Company&#146;s recent  initiatives is to manufacture  products in the
People&#146;s   Republic  of  China   (&#147;PRC&#148;)  in  order  to  reduce  the   Company&#146;s
manufacturing costs and allow a more aggressive marketing program in the private
cable  market.  Towards  this end, on  November  11,  2005,  the Company and its
wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Blonder  Tongue Far East,  LLC,  a  Delaware  limited
liability company,  entered into a joint venture agreement (&#147;<b>JV Agreement</b>&#148;) with
Master Gain International  Industrial Limited, a Hong Kong corporation  (&#147;<b>Master
Gain</b>&#148;),  intending to  manufacture  products in the PRC.  This joint venture was
formed to  compete  with Far East  manufactured  products  and to expand  market
coverage outside North America.  On June 9, 2006, the Company  terminated the JV
Agreement due to the joint venture&#146;s failure to meet certain quarterly financial
milestones  as set  forth  in the JV  Agreement.  The  inability  to  meet  such
financial  milestones was caused by the failure of Master Gain to contribute the
$5,850,000  of capital to the joint  venture as required by the JV Agreement and
the  joint  venture&#146;s  failure  to obtain  certain  governmental  approvals  and
licenses necessary for the operation of the joint venture.

     Although  the  termination  of the JV Agreement  has delayed the  Company&#146;s
efforts  to move  production  of its  products  to the  Far  East,  the  Company
continues to believe  that  shifting  production  to the Far East is in the best
interests of the Company.  The Company has shifted its manufacturing  initiative
in the PRC to now entail a combination of contract manufacturing  agreements and
purchasing  agreements with key PRC  manufacturers  that can most fully meet the
Company&#146;s needs.  The Company has entered into a manufacturing  agreement with a
core contract  manufacturer  in the PRC that would govern its  production of the
Company&#146;s high volume and complex  products upon the receipt of purchase  orders
from the Company.  It is  anticipated  this  transition  will relate to products
representing  a significant  portion of the Company&#146;s net sales and will be done
in phases over the next several years,  with the first products  estimated to be
transitioning within the next 6 to 9 months.

     In  addition,  on February  27, 2006 (the  &#147;<b>Effective  Date</b>&#148;),  the Company
entered into a series of agreements  related to its MegaPort&#153; line of high-speed
data communications  products. As a result of these agreements,  the Company has
expanded its  distribution  territory,  favorably  amended  certain  pricing and
volume  provisions  and  extended  by 10  years  the  term  of the  distribution
agreement for its  MegaPort&#153;  product line.  These  agreements  also require the
Company to guaranty  payment  due by  Shenzhen  Junao  Technology  Company  Ltd.
(&#147;<b>Shenzhen</b>&#148;)  to Octalica,  Ltd.  (&#147;<b>Octalica</b>&#148;),  in connection  with  Shenzhen&#146;s
purchase of T.M.T.-Third  Millennium  Technology  Limited (&#147;<b>TMT</b>&#148;) from Octalica.
Shenzhen is an affiliate of Master Gain. In exchange for this guaranty, MegaPort
Technology, LLC (&#147;<b>MegaPort</b>&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, obtained
an assignable  option (the &#147;<b>Option</b>&#148;) to acquire  substantially all of the assets
and assume  certain  liabilities of TMT on  substantially  the same terms as the
acquisition  of TMT by Shenzhen from  Octalica.  The purchase price for TMT and,
therefore,  the amount and payment terms guaranteed by the Company is the sum of
$383,150 plus an earn-out. The earn-out will not exceed 4.5% of the net revenues
derived  from  the  sale of  certain  products  during  a  period  of 36  months
commencing  after the sale of  certain  specified  quantities  of TMT  inventory
following the Effective  Date. The cash portion of the purchase price is payable
(i) $22,100 on the 120th day following the Effective  Date,  (ii) $22,100 on the
last day of the  twenty-fourth  month  following the Effective  Date,  and (iii)
$338,950  commencing  upon  the  later  of (A)  the  second  anniversary  of the
Effective  Date and (B) the date after which  certain  volume sales  targets for
each of the MegaPort&#153; products have been met, and then only as and to the extent
that  revenues  are  derived  from sales of such  products.  In  February  2007,
MegaPort  sent notice to TMT and Shenzhen of its election to exercise the Option
to acquire  substantially  all of the assets of TMT.  Upon  consummation  of the
acquisition,  MegaPort,  or its assignee,  will pay Shenzhen, in the same manner
and at the same times,  cash payments  equal to the purchase  price payments due
from Shenzhen to Octalica and will assume certain liabilities of TMT.

<i>2006 Compared with 2005</i>

     <i>Net sales</i>.  Net sales  increased  $1,045,000 or 3.0% to $35,775,000 in 2006
from $34,730,000 in 2005. The increase is primarily attributed to an increase in
sales of digital  headend  products  and fiber  products  offset by decreases in
sales of interdiction  and analog headend  products.  Digital headend sales were
$5,715,000  and   $4,725,000,   fiber  sales  were  $1,731,000  and  $1,027,000,
interdiction  sales were $1,835,000 and $2,054,000 and analog headend sales were
$17,506,000 and $17,901,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

     <i>Cost of Goods Sold</i>.  Costs of goods sold decreased to $23,409,000  for 2006
from  $27,399,000  in 2005 and  decreased as a percentage of sales to 65.4% from
78.9%.  The decrease is  primarily  attributed  to an increase in the  inventory
reserve of $114,000 in 2006 as compared to an increase in the inventory  reserve
of  $4,373,000  in 2005.  The  change  in the  inventory  reserve  is  primarily
attributed to fully reserving items for which there was no usage in 2005.

     <i>Selling  Expenses</i>.  Selling expenses  increased to $4,738,000 for 2006 from
$4,481,000 in 2005 and increased as a percentage of sales to 13.2% for 2006 from
12.9% for 2005. This $257,000 increase is primarily  attributable to an increase
in travel and  entertainment  of $101,000 and an increase in freight  expense of
$102,000 due to increased shipping and handling costs.

     <i>General and Administrative  Expenses</i>.  General and administrative  expenses
increased to  $5,658,000  in 2006 from  $5,022,000  for 2005 and  increased as a
percentage of sales to 15.8% for 2006 from 14.4% in 2005. This $636,000 increase
is primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and fringes of $422,000 due
to  increased  head count and an increase in  executive  bonuses,  as well as an
increase in professional fees of $215,000.

     <i>Research  and  Development  Expense</i>.   Research  and  development  expenses
increased  to  $1,634,000  in 2006 from  $1,552,000  in 2005 and  increased as a
percentage of sales to 4.6% in 2006 from 4.5% in 2005. This $82,000  increase is
primarily attributable to an increase in consulting fees of $76,000.

     <i>Operating  Income (Loss)</i>.  Operating income of $336,000 for 2006 represents
an  increase  of  $4,060,000  from an  operating  loss of  $3,724,000  in  2005.
Operating  income (loss) as a percentage of sales increased to 1.0% in 2006 from
(10.7%) in 2005.

     Interest  expense.  Interest  expense  decreased  to  $711,000 in 2006 from
$796,000 in 2005. The decrease is the result of lower average borrowings.

     Income Taxes.  The provision for income taxes remained at zero for 2006 and
2005.  The  provision  is zero as a result of an  increase in the  deferred  tax
assets due to net operating  loss carry  forwards being offset by an increase in
the  valuation   allowance  of  $502,000  and   $1,959,000  in  2006  and  2005,
respectively,  since  the  realization  of  the  deferred  tax  benefit  is  not
considered  more likely than not.  The Company  believes  its current  projected
taxable  income over the next five years as well as certain tax  strategies  are
adequate to the realization of the remaining deferred tax benefit.



                                       27




<i>2005 Compared with 2004</i>

     <i>Net sales</i>.  Net sales  decreased  $3,053,000 or 8.1% to $34,730,000 in 2005
from $37,783,000 in 2004. The decrease is primarily  attributed to a decrease in
sales of high-speed  data products of $1,095,000 in 2005 and the collection of a
$1,929,000 note receivable in 2004 which was being recorded in revenue on a cash
basis.

     <i>Cost of Goods Sold</i>.  Cost of goods sold increased to  $27,399,000  for 2005
from  $26,104,000  in 2004 and  increased as a percentage of sales to 78.9% from
69.1%.  The increase is  primarily  attributed  to an increase in the  inventory
reserve of  $4,373,000  in 2005 as  compared  to an  increase  in the  inventory
reserve of $872,000 in 2004. The increase in the inventory  reserve is primarily
attributed to fully reserving items for which there was no usage in 2005.

     <i>Selling  Expenses</i>.  Selling expenses  increased to $4,481,000 for 2005 from
$4,169,000 in 2004 and increased as a percentage of sales to 12.9% for 2005 from
11.0% for 2004. This $312,000 increase is primarily  attributable to an increase
in salaries and fringe benefits of $330,000 due to an increase in head count.

     <i>General and Administrative  Expenses</i>.  General and administrative  expenses
increased to  $5,022,000  in 2005 from  $4,719,000  for 2004 and  increased as a
percentage of sales to 14.4% for 2005 from 12.5% in 2004. This $303,000 increase
is primarily attributable to an increase in bad debt expense of $253,000 as well
as an increase in professional fees of $180,000.

     <i>Research  and  Development  Expense</i>.   Research  and  development  expenses
increased  to  $1,552,000  in 2005 from  $1,549,000  in 2004 and  increased as a
percentage of sales to 4.5% in 2005 from 4.1% in 2004.  This $3,000  increase is
primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and fringe benefits of $53,000
offset by a decrease in product  licensing fees and  depreciation of $33,000 and
$17,000, respectively.

     <i>Operating Income (Loss)</i>. Operating loss of $3,724,000 for 2005 represents a
decrease of $4,966,000  from operating  income of $1,242,000 in 2004.  Operating
income (loss) as a percentage of sales decreased to (10.7%) in 2005 from 3.3% in
2004.

     <i>Interest  expense</i>.  Interest  expense  decreased  to  $796,000 in 2005 from
$903,000 in 2004. The decrease is the result of lower average borrowings.

     <i>Income Taxes</i>.  The  provision  for income taxes  decreased to zero for 2005
from $2,826,000 in 2004. The provision is zero as a result of an increase in the
deferred tax assets due to net operating  loss carry forwards being offset by an
increase in the valuation  allowance of $1,959,000  since the realization of the
deferred  tax  benefit is not  considered  more  likely  than not.  The  Company
believes its current  projected  taxable income over the next five years as well
as certain tax  strategies  are  adequate to the  realization  of the  remaining
deferred tax benefit.


<b>Inflation and Seasonality</b>

     Inflation and seasonality  have not had a material impact on the results of
operations  of the Company.  Fourth  quarter  sales in 2006 as compared to other
quarters were slightly  impacted by fewer  production  days. The Company expects
sales each year in the fourth quarter to be impacted by fewer production days.

<b>Liquidity and Capital Resources</b>

     As of  December  31,  2006 and 2005,  the  Company&#146;s  working  capital  was
$9,511,000  and  $7,108,000,  respectively.  The increase in working  capital is
attributable  primarily  to a  decrease  in  the  current  portion  of  debt  of
$1,780,000, and a decrease in accounts payable of $834,000.

     The Company&#146;s net cash provided by operating  activities for the year ended
December  31,  2006  was  $72,000  primarily  due  to an  increase  in  accounts
receivable of $316,000 and an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and
accrued  compensation  of $719,000,  compared to net cash  provided by operating
activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $2,646,000.



                                       28



     Cash  provided  by  investing   activities   was   $3,745,000,   which  was
attributable  primarily  to  proceeds  from  the sale of BDR of  $2,234,000  and
proceeds from the sale of patents of $2,000,000  offset by capital  expenditures
of $398,000.

     Cash used in  financing  activities  was  $4,520,000  for the period  ended
December  31,  2006,  comprised  of  repayment  of  debt  of  $40,635,000,   and
acquisition of treasury  stock of $970,000,  offset by $37,085,000 in additional
borrowings of debt.

     On  December  29,  2005 the  Company  entered  into a Credit  and  Security
Agreement ("<b>Credit Agreement</b>") with National City Business Credit, Inc. ("<b>NCBC</b>")
and National City Bank (the  "Bank").  The Credit  Agreement  provides for (i) a
$10,000,000  asset-based revolving credit facility ("<b>Revolving Loan</b>") and (ii) a
$3,500,000  term loan facility  ("<b>Term  Loan</b>"),  both of which have a three year
term.  The amounts which may be borrowed  under the Revolving  Loan are based on
certain  percentages of Eligible  Receivables  and Eligible  Inventory,  as such
terms are defined in the Credit Agreement.  The obligations of the Company under
the  Credit  Agreement  are  secured by  substantially  all of the assets of the
Company.

     Under the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Loan bears interest at a rate per
annum equal to the Libor Rate Plus 2.25%,  or the  "Alternate  Base Rate," being
the higher of (i) the prime lending rate announced from time to time by the Bank
or (ii) the Federal Funds  Effective Rate (as defined in the Credit  Agreement),
plus 0.50%.  The Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Libor
Rate plus 2.75% or the Alternate  Base Rate plus 0.50%.  In connection  with the
Term Loan, the Company  previously  entered into an interest rate swap agreement
("<b>Swap  Agreement</b>") with the Bank which exchanges the variable  interest rate of
the Term Loan for a fixed interest rate of 5.13% per annum effective January 10,
2006 through the maturity of the Term Loan.

     In  March  2006,  the  Credit  Agreement  was  amended  to (i)  modify  the
definition of "EBITDA" to exclude  certain  non-cash items from the  calculation
thereof,  (ii) increase the applicable interest rates for the Revolving Loan and
Term Loan  thereunder  by 25 basis points until such time as the Company has met
certain financial covenants for two consecutive fiscal quarters, (iii) impose an
availability  block of $500,000  under the Company&#146;s  borrowing  base until such
time as the Company  has met certain  financial  covenants  for two  consecutive
fiscal  quarters,   and  (iv)  retroactively   modify  the  agreement  to  defer
applicability  of the  fixed  charge  coverage  ratio  until  June 30,  2006 and
increase the required ratio from 1.00:1.00 to 1.10:1.00 thereunder.

     On December 15, 2006, the Company and BDR, as Borrowers, and Blonder Tongue
Investment  Company,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of the Company,  as Guarantor,
executed a Second Amendment to Credit and Security  Agreement (the "Amendment").
The  Amendment  removes  BDR as a  "Borrower"  under  the  Credit  and  Security
Agreement  dated as of December 29, 2005,  as amended (the "Credit  Agreement"),
and includes  other  modifications  and  amendments to the Credit  Agreement and
related ancillary  agreements  necessitated by the removal of BDR as a Borrower.
These other  modifications  and amendments  include a reduction of approximately
$1,400,000  to the maximum  amount of Revolving  Advances that NCBC will make to
the Company due to the release from  collateral  of the rights of entry owned by
BDR.

     The  Revolving  Loan  terminates  on December 28,  2008,  at which time all
outstanding  borrowings under the Revolving Loan are due. The Term Loan requires
equal  monthly  principal  payments of $19,000  each,  plus  interest,  with the
remaining  balance  due at  maturity.  Both loans are  subject  to a  prepayment
penalty if satisfied in full prior to the second  anniversary  of the  effective
date of the loans.

     The Credit Agreement contains customary  representations  and warranties as
well  as  affirmative  and  negative  covenants,   including  certain  financial
covenants. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including,
among others, non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts when due.

     Proceeds  from the Credit  Agreement  were used to refinance  the Company&#146;s
former credit  facility with  Commerce  Bank,  N.A.  ("Commerce  Bank"),  to pay
transaction  costs, to provide  working capital and for other general  corporate
purposes.

     The  Company&#146;s  former credit  facility  with Commerce Bank was  originally
entered into on March 20, 2002.  The  Commerce  Bank credit  facility was for an
aggregate amount of $18,500,000, comprised of (i) a $6,000,000 revolving line of
credit  under  which  funds could be borrowed at the prime rate plus 2.0% with a
floor of 5.5%, (ii) a $9,000,000 term loan which bore interest at a rate of 7.5%
and which  required equal monthly  principal  payments of $193,000 plus interest
with a final payment on April 1, 2006 of all of the remaining  unpaid  principal



                                       29



and interest,  and (iii) a $3,500,000 mortgage loan bearing interest at 7.5% and
which required equal monthly principal payments of $19,000, with a final payment
on April 1, 2017, subject to a call provision after five years.

     At December  31,  2006,  there was  $2,199,000  outstanding  under the NCBC
Revolving Loan. The Company has the ability to borrow  $7,801,000 under its line
of credit,  however only $1,405,000 was available at December 31, 2006, based on
the Company&#146;s current collateral.

     The average amount  outstanding on the Company&#146;s line of credit during 2006
was $3,522,000 at a weighted  average  interest rate of 8.9%. The maximum amount
outstanding on the lines of credit during 2006 was $4,558,000.

     The Company  anticipates that the cash generated from operations,  existing
cash balances and amounts available under its credit facility with NCBC, will be
sufficient to satisfy its foreseeable working capital needs.

     Contractual Obligations and Commitments

     At December 31, 2006, the Company&#146;s contractual obligations and commitments
to make future payments are as follows:

     course of business.

<b>Critical Accounting Policies</b>

     The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States.   Preparing  financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles requires
the Company to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as
of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses  during  the  reporting  period.  The  following  paragraphs  include a
discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required.  You should also
review Note 1 to the financial  statements for further discussion of significant
accounting policies.



                                       30



<i>Revenue Recognition</i>

     The Company records revenue when products are shipped. Legal title and risk
of loss with respect to the products pass to customers at the point of shipment.
Customers do not have a right to return products shipped. Products carry a three
year warranty, which amount is not material to the Company&#146;s operations.

<i>Inventory and Obsolescence</i>

     The  Company  periodically  analyzes  anticipated  product  sales  based on
historical  results,  current  backlog  and  marketing  plans.  Based  on  these
analyses,  the Company anticipates that certain products will not be sold during
the next twelve months.  Inventories  that are not anticipated to be sold in the
next twelve months, have been classified as non-current. This procedure has been
applied  to the  December  31,  2006  and  2005  inventories  and,  accordingly,
$5,052,000 and  $4,866,000,  respectively,  have been  classified to non-current
assets.

     Over 60% of the non-current inventories are comprised of raw materials. The
Company has  established a program to use  interchangeable  parts in its various
product  offerings and to modify  certain of its finished  goods to better match
customer demands. In addition,  the Company has instituted  additional marketing
programs to dispose of the slower moving inventories.

     The Company  continually  analyzes  its  slow-moving,  excess and  obsolete
inventories. Based on historical and projected sales volumes for finished goods,
historical and projected usage of raw materials, and anticipated selling prices,
the  Company  establishes  reserves.  If the  Company  does not  meet its  sales
expectations  these reserves are  increased.  Products that are determined to be
obsolete are written down to net  realizable  value.  During 2006 and 2005,  the
Company  recorded  an  increase  to its  reserve  of  $114,000  and  $4,372,000,
respectively.  The increase in the inventory  reserve  during 2006 was primarily
the result of an increase in certain obsolete raw materials. The increase in the
inventory  reserve during 2005 was primarily the result of reserving 100% of all
items for which there was no usage over the previous  twelve  months and 100% of
the value of closeout  products.  The Company believes reserves are adequate and
inventories are reflected at net realizable value.

<i>Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts</i>

     Management  periodically  performs  a detailed  review of amounts  due from
customers  to determine if accounts  receivable  balances are impaired  based on
factors affecting the collectibility of those balances.  Management&#146;s  estimates
of  the  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  requires   management  to  exercise
significant  judgment  about the timing,  frequency  and severity of  collection
losses,  which affects the  allowances  and net  earnings.  As these factors are
difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter  management
assumptions, these allowances may need to be adjusted in the future.

<i>Long-Lived Assets</i>

     On a periodic basis,  management  assesses whether there are any indicators
that the value of the Company&#146;s  long-lived  assets may be impaired.  An asset&#146;s
value may be impaired only if management&#146;s estimate of the aggregate future cash
flows, on an undiscounted  basis, to be generated by the asset are less than the
carrying value of the asset.

     If impairment has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the
carrying  amount of the asset over the fair value of the long-lived  asset.  The
Company&#146;s  estimates of aggregate  future cash flows expected to be generated by
each long-lived  asset are based on a number of assumptions  that are subject to
economic and market uncertainties. As these factors are difficult to predict and
are subject to future events that may alter management&#146;s assumptions, the future
cash flows  estimated  by  management  in their  impairment  analyses may not be
achieved.

<b>New Accounting Pronouncements</b>

     In February  2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, &#147;The Fair Value Option for
Financial  Assets and Financial  Liabilities&#148;  (&#147;SFAS  159&#148;).  SFAS 159 provides
companies with an option to report selected  financial assets and liabilities at
a fair  value.  The  objective  of SFAS  159 is to  reduce  both  complexity  in
accounting for financial  instruments  and the volatility in earnings  caused by
measuring related assets and liabilities differently.


                                       31



Generally accepted  accounting  principles have required  different  measurement
attributes  for  different  assets and  liabilities  that can create  artificial
volatility  in earnings.  The FASB has indicated it believes that SFAS 159 helps
to mitigate this type of accounting-induced  volatility by enabling companies to
report related assets and  liabilities at fair value,  which would likely reduce
the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting.  SFAS
159 also  establishes  presentation  and  disclosure  requirements  designed  to
facilitate  comparisons  between  companies  that choose  different  measurement
attributes  for similar  types of assets and  liabilities.  Management is in the
process of evaluating this pronouncement.

     In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting  Bulleting (&#147;SAB&#148;)
No. 108,  Considering the Effects of Prior Year  Misstatements  when Quantifying
Misstatements  in Current Year  Financial  Statements  ("SAB 108&#148;).  SAB 108 was
issued in order to reduce the  diversity  in  practice  in how public  companies
quantify  misstatements of financial  statements,  including  misstatements that
were not material to prior years&#146; financial statements. SAB 108 is effective for
fiscal year 2007. The adoption of this  pronouncement is not expected to have an
impact on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, &#147;Employer&#146;s Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.&#148; Among other items, SFAS
No. 158  requires  recognition  of the  overfunded or  underfunded  status of an
entity&#146;s  defined  benefit  postretirement  plan as an asset or liability in the
financial statements, requires the measurement of defined benefit postretirement
plan assets and  obligations  as of the end of the  employer&#146;s  fiscal year, and
requires  recognition  of the funded  status of defined  benefit  postretirement
plans in other comprehensive  income. SFAS No. 158 is effective for fiscal years
ending  after  December 15,  2006.  The Company  adopted  SFAS 158 in the fourth
quarter of 2006 on a  prospective  basis and does not believe  that the adoption
will  have a  material  impact  on its  consolidated  results  of  operation  or
financial position.

     In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued
SFAS No. 157,  &#147;Accounting for Fair Value  Measurements.&#148;  SFAS No. 157 defines
fair value,  and  establishes a framework for measuring  fair value in generally
accepted   accounting   principles  and  expands  disclosure  about  fair  value
measurements.  SFAS  No.  157  is  effective  for  the  Company  for  financial
statements issued subsequent to November 15, 2007.  The Company does not believe
adoption  of SFAS No.  157  will  have a  material  impact  on its  consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     In May 2005,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,  "Accounting  Changes and Error
Corrections,  a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20,  Accounting  Changes and FASB
Statement No. 3" which, among other things, changes the accounting and reporting
requirements for a change in accounting principle and provides guidance on error
corrections.  SFAS No. 154 requires  retrospective  application  to prior period
financial  statements  of a  voluntary  change in  accounting  principle  unless
impracticable to determine the  period-specific  effects or cumulative effect of
the change,  and restatement with respect to the reporting of error corrections.
SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting  principles,  and to
changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the
pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. SFAS No. 154 also
requires that a change in method of depreciation or amortization for long-lived,
non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is
effected by a change in  accounting  principle.  SFAS No. 154 is  effective  for
accounting  changes and  corrections  of errors made in fiscal  years  beginning
after  December  15,  2005.  Adoption of SFAS No. 154 has not had a  significant
impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements or results of operations.

     In March  2005,  the FASB  issued  FASB  Interpretation  ("<b>FIN</b>")  No.  47,
"Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement  Obligations - An Interpretation of
FASB  Statement  No. 143" ("<b>FIN 47</b>"),  which will result in (a) more  consistent
recognition of liabilities  relating to asset retirement  obligations,  (b) more
information   about  expected   future  cash  outflows   associated  with  those
obligations,  and (c) more  information  about  investment in long-lived  assets
because  additional  asset  retirement  costs will be  recognized as part of the
carrying amounts of the assets. FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset
retirement  obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,"  refers  to a legal  obligation  to  perform  an asset  retirement
activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement  are  conditional  on a
future  event  that may or may not be within  the  control  of the  entity.  The
obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though
uncertainty  exists about the timing  and/or method of  settlement.  Uncertainty
about the timing and/or method of settlement of a conditional  asset  retirement
obligation  should  be  factored  into the  measurement  of the  liability  when
sufficient  information  exists. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have
sufficient  information  to  reasonably  estimate  the  fair  value  of an asset
retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years



                                       32



ending after  December 15,  2005.  The Company  adopted FIN 47 at the end of its
2005  fiscal  year and the  adoption  has not had a  significant  impact  on its
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

     In December  2004,  the FASB issued its final  standard on  accounting  for
share-based   payments   ("SBP"),   FASB  Statement  No.  123R  (revised  2004),
Share-Based  Payment.  The statement  requires companies to expense the value of
employee stock options and similar awards.  Under FAS 123R, SBP awards result in
a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards&#146;  grant date,  based on
the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest.  Compensation cost for
awards  that vest would not be  reversed  if the  awards  expire  without  being
exercised.  The  effective  date for  public  companies  was the  annual  period
beginning  after  December  15,  2005,  and it  applied to all  outstanding  and
unvested SBP awards at a company&#146;s adoption. Implementation of FAS 123R resulted
in additional stock-based compensation expense.

     In November,  2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  "Inventory  Costs",  an
amendment  of  Accounting  Research  Bulletin  No. 43  Chapter  4. SFAS No.  151
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling  costs and wasted  material.  SFAS No. 151 is effective  for  inventory
costs incurred  during fiscal years  beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption
of SFAS No.  151 has not had a  material  effect on the  Company&#146;s  consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     In December,  2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-1 ("FSP FAS
No.  109-1"),  "Application  of FASB Statement No. 109,  &#146;Accounting  for Income
Taxes,&#146; to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production  Activities Provided by the
American  Jobs  Creation  Act of 2004." The American  Jobs  Creation Act of 2004
introduces  a special  tax  deduction  of up to 9% when fully  phased in, of the
lesser of "qualified  production  activities  income" or taxable income. FSP FAS
109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax
deduction  in  accordance  with SFAS No. 109.  FSP FAS No.  109-1 did not have a
material effect on the Company&#146;s financial statements.

<b>ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</b>

     The  market  risk  inherent  in the  Company&#146;s  financial  instruments  and
positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest
rates.  At December  31,  2006 and 2005 the  principal  amount of the  Company&#146;s
aggregate  outstanding variable rate indebtedness was $3,966,000 and $7,322,000,
respectively.  A  hypothetical  100 basis point adverse change in interest rates
would have had an annualized  unfavorable  impact of  approximately  $40,000 and
$73,000, respectively, on the Company&#146;s earnings and cash flows based upon these
year-end  debt levels.  With regard to the Company&#146;s  $3,500,000  Term Loan with

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Audit Committee of
Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc.
Old Bridge, New Jersey


We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Blonder Tongue
Laboratories,  Inc.  and  Subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders&#146;
equity and cash flows for the years then ended.  These financial  statements are
the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements  are free of material  misstatement.  The Company is not  required to
have,  nor were we engaged to perform,  an audit of its  internal  control  over
financial reporting.  Our audit included  consideration of internal control over
financial  reporting  as  a  basis  for  designing  audit  procedures  that  are
appropriate  in the  circumstances,  but not for the  purpose of  expressing  an
opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Company&#146;s  internal control over financial
reporting.  Accordingly,  we express  no such  opinion.  An audit also  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial   statements,   assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the financial  position of Blonder Tongue  Laboratories,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for the years  then  ended in  conformity  with
United States generally accepted accounting principles.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 (In thousands)



Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     (a)  Company and Basis of Presentation

     Blonder  Tongue   Laboratories,   Inc.  (the   "Company")  is  a  designer,
manufacturer  and supplier of  electronics  and systems  equipment for the cable
television  industry,  primarily  throughout the United States. The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Blonder Tongue  Laboratories,  Inc.
and subsidiaries (including BDR Broadband, LLC "BDR").  Significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

     The  Company&#146;s  investment  in Blonder  Tongue  Telephone,  LLC ("BTT") and
NetLinc Communications,  LLC ("NetLinc") were accounted for on the equity method
since the Company did not have  control over these  entities.  On June 30, 2006,
the Company sold its ownership interest in BTT. See Note 13.

     The  Company  does  not  have  substantive   participating  rights  in  the
day-to-day  operations  of  NetLinc.  NetLinc  is  managed by a Board of Mangers
consisting  of two  Managers,  one of whom is a  controlling  member of the sole
other member of NetLinc and the other is an officer of the Company. However, the
Managers have delegated general and active management of NetLinc to a President,
who is also in a control  position with respect to such other  member.  Although
the Company owns a 50% equity and voting  interest in NetLinc,  all decisions of
the members,  including the election of Managers, require a vote of at least 51%
of the voting  interests.  In  addition,  each action of the Board of  Managers,
including the election and removal of the President, requires a majority vote of
the  Managers.  The  Company,  therefore,  does not control the  election of the
Managers or the President of NetLinc,  and does not have the power to remove the
President.  Accordingly,  the other  member  of  NetLinc  possesses  substantive
participating  rights through its common  affiliation  with the  President.  The
Company  does  possess  certain  protective  rights in  connection  with certain
actions  by  NetLinc  which  require  the  unanimous  approval  of all  members,
including the creation of a new class of membership interest, approving a change
of control, and approving a change in the nature of its business.

     On November 11, 2005, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary,  Blonder
Tongue Far East, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, entered into a joint
venture agreement with Master Gain International Industrial Limited, a Hong Kong
corporation,  to manufacture  products in the People&#146;s  Republic of China.  This
joint venture was formed to compete with Far East  manufactured  products and to
expand market  coverage  outside  North  America.  On June 9, 2006,  the Company
terminated the JV Agreement due to the joint  venture&#146;s  failure to meet certain
quarterly financial  milestones as set forth in the JV Agreement.  The inability
to meet such financial  milestones was caused, in part, by the failure of Master
Gain to contribute the $5,850 of capital to the joint venture as required by the
JV Agreement  and the joint  venture&#146;s  failure to obtain  certain  governmental
approvals and licenses necessary for the operation of the joint venture.

(b)  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful accounts

     Accounts receivable are customer  obligations due under normal trade terms.
The Company  sells its products  primarily  to  distributors  and private  cable
operators.  The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers&#146;
financial  condition  and  although  the  Company  generally  does  not  require
collateral,  letters of credit may be  required  from its  customers  in certain
circumstances.

     Senior  management  reviews  accounts  receivable  on a  monthly  basis  to
determine if any  receivables  will  potentially be  uncollectible.  The Company
includes  any  accounts   receivable   balances   that  are   determined  to  be
uncollectible,  along  with a general  reserve,  in its  overall  allowance  for
doubtful  accounts.  After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the
receivable  is written  off  against  the  allowance.  Based on the  information
available,  the Company  believes  its  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts as of
December  31, 2006 is  adequate;  however,  actual  write-offs  might exceed the
recorded allowance.

(c)  Inventories

     Inventories  are stated at the lower of cost,  determined  by the first-in,
first-out ("FIFO") method, or market.



                                       46



               BLONDER TONGUE LABORATORIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                 (In thousands)


     The  Company  periodically  analyzes  anticipated  product  sales  based on
historical  results,  current  backlog  and  marketing  plans.  Based  on  these
analyses,  the Company anticipates that certain products will not be sold during
the next twelve months.  Inventories  that are not anticipated to be sold in the
next twelve months, have been classified as non-current.

     The Company  continually  analyzes  its  slow-moving,  excess and  obsolete
inventories.  Based on historical  and projected  sales volumes and  anticipated
selling prices, the Company establishes  reserves.  If the Company does not meet
its  sales  expectations,  these  reserves  are  increased.  Products  that  are
determined to be obsolete are written down to net realizable value. During 2005,
the  Company  reserved  100% of all items for which  there was no usage over the
previous twelve months and 100% of the value of closeout  products.  The Company
recorded an increase to its reserve of $114,  $4,372 and $872 during 2006,  2005
and  2004,  respectively.   The  Company  believes  reserves  are  adequate  and
inventories are reflected at net realizable value.

(d)  Property, Plant and Equipment

     Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for
depreciation  generally on the straight-line  method based upon estimated useful
lives of 3 to 5 years  for  office  equipment,  5 to 7 years for  furniture  and
fixtures, 6 to 10 years for machinery and equipment, 10 to 15 years for building
improvements, 5 to 7 years for cable systems, and 40 years for the manufacturing
and administrative office facility.

(e)  Income Taxes

     The Company  accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of
Financial  Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Deferred
income  taxes are provided  for  temporary  differences  in the  recognition  of
certain income and expenses for financial and tax reporting purposes.  Valuation
allowances are  established  when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount expected to be realized.

(f)  Intangible Assets

     Intangible assets, net totaling $107 and $2,584 as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively,  consist of acquired patent rights and rights-of-entry,  and
are  carried at cost less  accumulated  amortization.  Amortization  is computed
utilizing  the  straight-line  method  over  the  estimated  useful  life of the
respective asset, 12 years for patents and 5 years for rights-of-entry.

     The  components of intangible  assets at December 31, 2006 and December 31,
2005 are as follows:

                                December 31, 2006        December 31, 2005

(g)  Long-Lived Assets

     The Company follows  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 144,
"Accounting  for the  Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets" ("FAS 144").
FAS  144  standardized   the  accounting   practices  for  the  recognition  and
measurement  of  impairment  losses  on  certain   long-lived  assets  based  on
non-discounted  cash flows.  No  impairment  losses have been  recorded  through
December 31, 2006.

(h)  Statements of Cash Flows

     For  purposes of the  consolidated  statements  of cash flows,  the Company
considers all highly liquid debt  instruments with a maturity of less than three
months at  purchase  to be cash  equivalents.  The Company did not have any cash
equivalents at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

(i)  Research and Development

     Research  and  development  expenditures  for the  Company&#146;s  projects  are
expensed as incurred.

(j)  Revenue Recognition

     The Company  records  revenues when products are shipped.  Customers do not
have a right of return.  The  Company  provides a three  year  warranty  on most
products.

(k)  Earnings (loss) Per Share

     Earnings  (loss) per share are calculated in accordance with FAS 128, which
provides for the calculation of "basic" and "diluted" earnings (loss) per share.
Basic earnings (loss) per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing
net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflect, in periods in which they have
a dilutive  effect,  the effect of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock
options.

(l)  Treasury Stock

     Treasury  Stock is recorded at cost.  Gains and losses on  disposition  are
recorded as increases or decreases to additional  paid-in capital with losses in
excess of previously recorded gains charged directly to retained earnings.

(m)  Derivative Financial Instruments

     The Company  utilizes  interest rate swaps at times to manage interest rate
exposures.  The Company specifically designates interest rate swaps as hedges of
debt  instruments  and  recognizes  interest  differentials  as  adjustments  to
interest  expense in the period they occur.  The Company  does not hold or issue
financial  instruments  for  trading  purposes.  Although  the  Company  held an
interest rate swap at December 31, 2006, the effect on the balance sheet was not
deemed material.  The Company did not hold any derivative financial  instruments
at December 31, 2005.

(n)  Significant Risks and Uncertainties

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect the  reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Approximately  44% of the  Company&#146;s  employees are covered by a three year
collective bargaining agreement, which expires in February 2009.

                                 (In thousands)


     The Company estimates that headend products accounted for approximately 49%
of the Company&#146;s  revenues in 2006, 49% in 2005 and 52% in 2004. Any substantial
decrease in sales of headend  products  could have a material  adverse effect on
the Company&#146;s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

(o)  Stock Options

     The  Company  implemented  SFAS No.  123(R),  "Accounting  for  Share-Based
Payment," in the first  quarter of 2006.  The  statement  requires  companies to
expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards. Under FAS 123(R)
share-based  payment awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value
on the  awards&#146;  grant date  based on the  estimated  number of awards  that are
expected to vest. Compensation cost for awards that vest will not be reversed if
the awards expire without being exercised.  Stock compensation expense under FAS
123(R) was $252 for the year ended December 31, 2006.

     The Company  estimates  the fair value of each stock  option grant by using
the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model with the  following  weighted  average
assumptions  used for  grants:  expected  lives of 6.3,  9.5 and 9.5  years;  no
dividend  yield;  volatility at 72%, 73% and 73%; and risk free interest rate of
4.65%, 3.2% and 3.2% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

     Under accounting  provisions of FAS 123, the Company&#146;s net income (loss) to
common  shareholders  and net income  (loss) per  common  share  would have been
adjusted to the pro forma  amounts  indicated  below (in  thousands,  except per
share data):

(p)  New Accounting Pronouncements

     In February  2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, &#147;The Fair Value Option for
Financial  Assets and Financial  Liabilities&#148;  (&#147;SFAS  159&#148;).  SFAS 159 provides
companies with an option to report selected  financial assets and liabilities at
fair value. The objective of SFAS 159 is to reduce both complexity in accounting
for financial  instruments  and the  volatility  in earning  caused by measuring
related  assets  and  liabilities  differently.  Generally  accepted  accounting
principles have required different  measurement  attributes for different assets
and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings.  The FASB has
indicated   it  believes   that  SFAS  159  helps  to  mitigate   this  type  of
accounting-induced volatility be enabling companies to report related assets and
liabilities  at fair value,  which would likely reduce the need for companies to
comply  with  detailed  rules for hedge  accounting.  SFAS 159 also  establishes
presentation  and  disclosure  requirements  designed to facilitate  comparisons
between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types
of assets and  liabilities.  Management  is in the  process of  evaluating  this
pronouncement.

     In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting  Bulleting (&#147;SAB&#148;)
No. 108,  Considering the Effects of Prior Year  Misstatements  when Quantifying
Misstatements  in Current Year  Financial  Statements  (&#147;SAB 108&#148;).  SAB 108 was
issued in order to reduce the  diversity  in  practice  in how public  companies
quantify misstatements of financial statements, including misstatement that were
not  material to prior years&#146;  financial  statements.  SAB 108 is effective  for
fiscal year 2007. The adoption of this  pronouncement is not expected to have an
impact on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, &#147;Employer&#146;s Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.&#148; Among other items, SFAS
No. 158  requires  recognition  of the  overfunded or  underfunded  status of an
entity&#146;s  defined  benefit  postretirement  plan as an asset or liability in the
financial statements, requires the measurement of defined benefit postretirement
plan assets and  obligations  as of the end of the  employer&#146;s  fiscal year, and
requires  recognition  of the funded  status of defined  benefit  postretirement
plans in other comprehensive  income. SFAS No. 158 is effective for fiscal years
ending  after  December 15,  2006.  The Company  adopted  SFAS 158 in the fourth
quarter of 2006 on a  prospective  basis and does not believe  that the adoption
will  have a  material  impact  on its  consolidated  results  of  operation  or
financial position.

     In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued
SFAS No. 157,  &#147;Accounting for Fair Value  Measurements.&#148;  SFAS No. 157 defines
fair value,  and  establishes a framework for measuring  fair value in generally
accepted   accounting   principles  and  expands  disclosure  about  fair  value
measurements.  SFAS  No.  157  is  effective  for  the  Company  for  financial
statements issued subsequent to November 15, 2007. The Company does not believe
adoption  of SFAS No.  157  will  have a  material  impact  on its  consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     In May 2005,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,  "Accounting  Changes and Error
Corrections,  a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20,  Accounting  Changes and FASB
Statement No. 3" which, among other things, changes the accounting and reporting
requirements for a change in accounting principle and provides guidance on error
corrections.  SFAS No. 154 requires  retrospective  application  to prior period
financial  statements  of a  voluntary  change in  accounting  principle  unless
impracticable to determine the  period-specific  effects or cumulative effect of
the change,  and restatement with respect to the reporting of error corrections.
SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting  principles,  and to
changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the
pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. SFAS No. 154 also
requires that a change in method of depreciation or amortization for long-lived,
non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is
effected by a change in  accounting  principle.  SFAS No. 154 is  effective  for
accounting  changes and  corrections  of errors made in fiscal  years  beginning
after  December  15,  2005.  Adoption of SFAS No. 154 has not had a  significant
impact on the Company&#146;s financial statements or results of operations.

     In March  2005,  the FASB  issued  FASB  Interpretation  ("<b>FIN</b>")  No.  47,
"Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement  Obligations - An Interpretation of
FASB  Statement  No. 143" ("<b>FIN 47</b>"),  which will result in (a) more  consistent
recognition of liabilities  relating to asset retirement  obligations,  (b) more
information   about  expected   future  cash  outflows   associated  with  those
obligations,  and (c) more  information  about  investment in long-lived  assets
because  additional  asset  retirement  costs will be  recognized as part of the
carrying amounts of the assets. FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset
retirement  obligation as used in SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,"  refers  to a legal  obligation  to  perform  an asset  retirement
activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement  are  conditional  on a
future  event  that may or may not be within  the  control  of the  entity.  The
obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though
uncertainty  exists about the timing  and/or method of  settlement.  Uncertainty
about the timing and/or method of settlement of a conditional  asset  retirement
obligation  should  be  factored  into the  measurement  of the  liability  when
sufficient  information  exists. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have
sufficient  information  to  reasonably  estimate  the  fair  value  of an asset
retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years
ending after  December 15,  2005.  The Company  adopted FIN 47 at the end of its
2005  fiscal  year and the  adoption  has not had a  significant  impact  on its
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

     In December  2004,  the FASB issued its final  standard on  accounting  for
share-based  payments ("<b>SBP</b>"),  SFAS No. 123(R) (revised 2004),  "Accounting for
Share-Based  Payment." The statement  requires companies to expense the value of
employee stock options and similar awards.  Under FAS 123(R),  SBP awards result
in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards&#146;  grant date,  based
on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest.  Compensation  cost
for awards that vest would not be reversed if the awards  expire  without  being
exercised.  The  effective  date for  public  companies  was the  annual  period
beginning  after  December  15,  2005,  and it  applied to all  outstanding  and
unvested  SBP  awards  at  a  company&#146;s  adoption.  The  Company  adopted  on  a
prospective  basis FAS 123(R) effective  January 1, 2006. The  implementation of
FAS 123(R) resulted in additional stock-based  compensation expense.

     In November,  2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  "Inventory  Costs",  an
amendment  of  Accounting  Research  Bulletin  No. 43  Chapter  4. SFAS No.  151
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling  costs and wasted  material.  SFAS No. 151 is effective  for  inventory
costs incurred  during fiscal years  beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption
of SFAS No.  151 has not had a  material  effect on the  Company&#146;s  consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

     In December,  2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-1 ("FSP FAS
No.  109-1"),  "Application  of FASB Statement No. 109,  &#146;Accounting  for Income
Taxes,&#146; to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production  Activities Provided by the
American  Jobs  Creation  Act of 2004." The American  Jobs  Creation Act of 2004
introduces  a special  tax  deduction  of up to 9% when fully  phased in, of the
lesser of "qualified  production  activities  income" or taxable income. FSP FAS
109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax
deduction  in  accordance  with SFAS No. 109.  FSP FAS No.  109-1 did not have a
material effect on the Company&#146;s financial statements.

<i>(r)  Royalty and License Expense</i>

     The  Company  records  royalty  expense,  as  applicable,  when the related
products  are sold.  Royalty  expense  is  recorded  as a  component  of selling
expenses.  The  Company  amortizes  license  fees over the life of the  relevant
contract.

<b>Note 4 - Debt</b>

     On  December  29,  2005 the  Company  entered  into a Credit  and  Security
Agreement ("Credit Agreement") with National City Business Credit, Inc. ("<b>NCBC</b>")
and National City Bank (the  "<b>Bank</b>").  The Credit  Agreement  provides for (i) a
$10,000 asset based  revolving  credit  facility  ("<b>Revolving  Loan</b>") and (ii) a
$3,500 term loan facility  ("<b>Term Loan</b>"),  both of which have a three year term.
The amounts which may be borrowed  under the Revolving Loan are based on certain
percentages of Eligible  Receivables and Eligible  Inventory,  as such terms are
defined in the Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Company under the Credit
Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company.

     Under the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Loan bears interest at a rate per
annum equal to the Libor Rate Plus 2.25%,  or the  "Alternate  Base Rate," being
the higher of (i) the prime lending rate announced from time to time by the Bank
or (ii) the Federal Funds  Effective Rate (as defined in the Credit  Agreement),
plus 0.50%.  The Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Libor
Rate plus 2.75% or the Alternate  Base Rate plus 0.50%.  In connection  with the
Term Loan, the Company  previously  entered into an interest rate swap agreement
("<b>Swap  Agreement</b>") with the Bank which exchanges the variable  interest rate of
the Term Loan for a fixed interest rate of 5.13% per annum effective January 10,
2006 through the maturity of the Term Loan.

     In March  2006,  the Credit  Agreement  was  amended to (i) modify  certain
financial  covenants as defined  under the credit  agreement,  (ii) increase the
applicable  interest rates for the Revolving Loan and Term Loan thereunder by 25
basis points until such time as the Company has met certain financial  covenants
for two consecutive  fiscal  quarters and (iii) impose an availability  block of
$500 under the Company&#146;s  borrowing  base until such time as the Company has met
certain financial covenants for two consecutive fiscal quarters.

     On December 15, 2006, the Company and BDR, as Borrowers, and Blonder Tongue
Investment  Company,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of the Company,  as Guarantor,
executed a Second Amendment to Credit and Security  Agreement (the  "Amendment")
with NCBC and the Bank.  The  Amendment  removes BDR as a  "Borrower"  under the
Credit and Security  Agreement  dated as of December  29, 2005,  as amended (the
"Credit  Agreement"),  and includes  other  modifications  and amendments to the
Credit Agreement and related ancillary agreements necessitated by the removal of
BDR as a Borrower.  These other modifications and amendments include a reduction
of  approximately  $1,400 to the maximum amount of Revolving  Advances that NCBC
will make to the  Company due to the release  from  collateral  of the rights of
entry owned by BDR.

     The  Revolving  Loan  terminates  on December 28,  2008,  at which time all
outstanding  borrowings under the Revolving Loan are due. The Term Loan requires
equal monthly principal payments of $19 each, plus interest,  with the remaining
balance  due at  maturity.  Both loans are  subject to a  prepayment  penalty if
satisfied in full prior to the second  anniversary  of the effective date of the
loans.

     The Credit Agreement contains customary  representations  and warranties as
well  as  affirmative  and  negative  covenants,   including  certain  financial
covenants. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including,
among others, non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts when due.

     Proceeds  from the Credit  Agreement  were used to refinance  the Company&#146;s
existing  credit  facility with Commerce Bank, N.A.  ("Commerce  Bank"),  to pay
transaction  costs, to provide  working capital and for other general  corporate
purposes.

     The  Company&#146;s  former credit  facility  with Commerce Bank was  originally
entered into on March 20, 2002.  The  Commerce  Bank credit  facility was for an
aggregate  amount of $18,500  comprised of (i) a $6,000 revolving line of credit
under  which funds could be borrowed at the prime rate plus 2.0% with a floor of
5.5%,  (ii) a $9,000  term loan which bore  interest at a rate of 7.5% and which
required  equal  monthly  principal  payments of $193 plus interest with a final
payment on April 1, 2006 of all of the remaining  unpaid principal and interest,
and (iii) a $3,500  mortgage  loan bearing  interest at 7.5% and which  required
equal monthly principal  payments of $19, with a final payment on April 1, 2017,
subject to a call provision after five years.

     The fair value of the debt  approximates  the  recorded  value based on the
borrowing rates currently  available to the Company for loans with similar terms
and maturities.

Long-term debt consists of the following:

During  2006 the plan&#146;s  total  unrecognized  net loss  increased  by $121.  The
variance  between  the actual and  expected  return on plan  assets  during 2006
decreased the total unrecognized net loss by $65. Because the total unrecognized
net gain or loss exceeds the greater of 10% of the projected benefit  obligation
or 10% of the plan asset, the excess will be amortized over the average expected
future working lifetime of active plan  participants.  As of January 1, 2006 the
average expected future working  lifetime of active plan  participants was 10.14
years.  Actual results for 2007 will depend on the 2007  actuarial  valuation of
the plan.

     The change in  unrecognized  net  gain/loss is one measure of the degree to
which important  assumptions have coincided with actual experience.  During 2006
the  unrecognized  net loss decreased by 1.7% of the December 31, 2005 projected
benefit obligation.  The company changes important assumptions whenever changing
conditions warrant. The discount rate is typically changed at least annually and
the expected  long-term  return on plan assets will  typically be revised  every
three  to five  years.  Other  material  assumptions  include  the  compensation
increase  rates,  rates  of  employee  termination,  and  rates  of  participant
mortality.

     The discount rate was determined by projecting the plan&#146;s  expected  future
benefit payments as defined for the projected  benefit  obligation,  discounting
those expected payments using a theoretical zero-coupon spot yield curve derived
from a universe of high-quality  bonds as of the  measurement  date, and solving
for the single  equivalent  discount  rate that  resulted in the same  projected
benefit  obligation.  A 1%  increase/(decrease)  in the discount rate would have
(decreased)/increased  the net  periodic  benefit  cost for 2006 by $(35)/37 and
(decreased)/increased the year-end projected benefit obligation by $(33)/425.

The  expected  return on plan  assets was  determined  based on  historical  and
expected  future  returns  of  the  various  asset  classes,  using  the  target
allocations described below. Each 1% increase/(decrease) in the expected rate of
return assumption would have (decreased)/increased the net periodic benefit cost
for 2006 by $24,000.

<b>Note 7 - Related Party Transactions</b>

     On  January  1,  1995,   the  Company   entered  into  a   consulting   and
non-competition  agreement  with James H.  Williams  who was a  director  of the
Company  until  May 24,  2006  and who was also the  largest  stockholder  until
November  14,  2006.  Under the  agreement,  Mr.  Williams  provides  consulting
services on various operational and financial issues and is currently paid at an
annual  rate of $169 but in no event is such  annual  rate  permitted  to exceed
$200. Mr. Williams also agreed to keep all Company information  confidential and
not to compete  directly  or  indirectly  with the  Company  for the term of the
agreement  and for a period of two years  thereafter.  The initial  term of this
agreement expired on December 31, 2004 and  automatically  renews thereafter for
successive one-year terms (subject to termination at the end of the initial term
or any renewal term on at least 90 days&#146; notice).  This agreement  automatically
renewed for a one-year  extension until December 31, 2007. On November 14, 2006,
the Company repurchased  1,293 shares of its common stock from Mr. Williams in a
private  off-market  block  transaction  for $0.75 per share,  for an  aggregate
purchase price of $970.

     As of December  31, 2006 the Chief  Executive  Officer was  indebted to the
Company in the amount of $166,  for which no  interest  has been  charged.  This
indebtedness  arose  from a series  of cash  advances,  the  latest of which was
advanced in February  2002 and is included in other  assets at December 31, 2006
and 2005.

     The President of the Company lent the Company 100% of the purchase price of
certain  used-equipment  inventory  purchased by the Company in October  through
November of 2003.  The  inventory  was  purchased at a  substantial  discount to
market  price.  While the  aggregate  cost to purchase all of the  inventory was
approximately  $950,  the  maximum  amount of  indebtedness  outstanding  to the
President  at any one time during 2005 was $94. The  President  made the loan to
the Company on a non-recourse  basis,  secured solely by a security  interest in
the inventory  purchased by the Company and the proceeds resulting from the sale
of the inventory. In consideration for the extension of credit on a non-recourse
basis,  the  President  received  from the Company  interest on the  outstanding
balance at the margin interest rate he incurred for borrowing the funds from his
lenders and received from the Company 25 % of the gross profit  derived from the
Company&#146;s resale of such inventory.  In April 2004, the President of the Company
acquired $75 of used equipment inventory,  which was subsequently sold by him to
the Company on a consignment basis.  Payment by the Company for the goods become
due upon  the  sale  thereof  by the  Company  and  collection  of the  accounts
receivable  generated by such sales.  In connection  with the  transaction,  the
Company  agreed to pay the President  cost plus 25% of the gross profit  derived
from the sale of such  inventory.  As of December 31, 2005,  all amounts owed to
the President were paid.

     As described in Note 13, the Company entered into a series of agreements in
2003 pursuant to which it acquired a 50% economic  ownership interest in NetLinc
Communications,  LLC ("<b>NetLinc</b>") and Blonder Tongue Telephone,  LLC ("<b>BTT</b>").  As
the non-cash  component of the purchase price,  the Company issued 500 shares of
its common stock to BTT,  resulting in BTT becoming the owner of greater than 5%
of the outstanding common stock of the Company. As further described in Note 13,
on June 30, 2006 the Company entered into the Share Exchange  Agreement with BTT
and certain related parties pursuant to which,  among other things,  the Company
received back these 500 shares in exchange for the Company&#146;s membership interest
in BTT and the grant to BTT of an equipment  purchase credit of $400,  which was
exercised in 2006. The Company will continue to pay future  royalties to NetLinc
upon the sale of certain telephony products.

<b>Note 8 - Concentration of Credit Risk</b>

     Financial  instruments that potentially  subject the Company to significant
concentrations  of credit risk consist  principally  of cash  deposits and trade
accounts receivable.

     The  Company  maintains  cash  balances  at  several  banks  located in the
northeastern United States. As part of its cash management process,  the Company
periodically reviews the relative credit standing of these banks.

     Credit risk with respect to trade accounts  receivable is concentrated with
two of the Company&#146;s customers.  These customers accounted for approximately 40%
and 21% of the Company&#146;s  outstanding trade accounts  receivable at December 31,

2006   and   2005,   respectively.   These   customers   are   distributors   of
telecommunications  and private cable  television  components,  and providers of
franchise and private cable  television  service.  The Company  performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers&#146; financial condition,  uses credit insurance
and requires collateral, such as letters of credit, to mitigate its credit risk.
The  deterioration  of the  financial  condition  of one or  more  of its  major
customers could  adversely  impact the Company&#146;s  operations.  From time to time
where the Company determines that circumstances warrant, such as when a customer
agrees to commit to a large blanket  purchase order, the Company extends payment
terms beyond its standard payment terms.

     The Company&#146;s largest customer accounted for approximately 20%, 17% and 18%
of the Company&#146;s  sales in each of the years ended  December 31, 2006,  2005 and
2004, respectively. This customer accounted for approximately 24% and 10% of the
Company&#146;s  outstanding trade accounts  receivable at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. A second customer accounted for approximately 14% of the Company&#146;s
trade accounts  receivable at December 31, 2006. A third customer  accounted for
approximately  11% of the Company&#146;s  trade  accounts  receivable at December 31,
2005.

<b>Note 9 - Stockholders&#146; Equity</b>

     On July 24,  2002,  the  Company  commenced a stock  repurchase  program to
acquire up to $300 of its  outstanding  common stock.  The stock  repurchase was
funded by a combination of the Company&#146;s cash on hand and borrowings against its
revolving line of credit. The Company repurchased 70 shares during 2003. On June
30,  2006,  the  Company  reacquired  500  shares of stock at a basis of $886 in
connection  with its sale of its  ownership  interest  in BTT (see Note 13).  On
November 14, 2006, the Company  repurchased 1,293 shares of its common stock for
$970 from a former director in a private off market block transaction.

<b>Note 11 - Stock Option Plans</b>

     In 1994, the Company  established the 1994 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the
"1994 Plan"). The 1994 Plan provided for the granting of Incentive Stock Options
to purchase  shares of the Company&#146;s  common stock to officers and key employees
at a price  not  less  than  the  fair  market  value  at the  date of  grant as
determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors.  The maximum
number of shares  available for issuance under the plan was 298.  Options became
exercisable  as  determined  by  the  compensation  committee  of the  Board  of
Directors at the date of grant. Options expire ten years from the date of grant.

     In  October,  1995,  the  Company&#146;s  Board of  Directors  and  stockholders
approved  the 1995 Long Term  Incentive  Plan (the "1995  Plan").  The 1995 Plan
provided for grants of "incentive stock options" or nonqualified  stock options,
and awards of restricted  stock,  to  executives  and key  employees,  including
officers  and  employee  Directors.   The  1995  Plan  is  administered  by  the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which determines the optionees
and the terms of the options granted under the 1995 Plan, including the exercise
price, number of shares subject to the option and the exercisability thereof, as
well as the recipients and number of shares awarded for restricted stock awards;
provided,  however,  that no employee may receive  stock  options or  restricted
stock  awards  which  would  result,  separately  or  in  combination,   in  the
acquisition  of more than 100 shares of Common  Stock of the  Company  under the
1995 Plan. The exercise price of incentive  stock options granted under the 1995
Plan must be equal to at least the fair market  value of the Common Stock on the
date of grant.  With respect to any optionee  who owns stock  representing  more
than 10% of the voting power of all classes of the Company&#146;s outstanding capital
stock,  the  exercise  price of any  incentive  stock option must be equal to at
least 110% of the fair  market  value of the Common  Stock on the date of grant,
and the term of the  option  may not exceed  five  years.  The term of all other
incentive  stock  options  granted under the 1995 Plan may not exceed ten years.
The aggregate  fair market value of Common Stock  (determined  as of the date of
the option  grant) for which an  incentive  stock  option may for the first time
become  exercisable in any calendar year may not exceed $100. The exercise price
for nonqualified stock options is established by the Compensation Committee, and
may be more or less than the fair market  value of the Common  Stock on the date
of grant.

     Stockholders  have  previously  approved a total of 1,150  shares of common
stock for  issuance  under the 1995  Plan,  as  amended  to date.  The 1995 Plan
expired by its terms on November 30, 2005.

     In May,  1998,  the  stockholders  of the Company  approved the Amended and
Restated  1996 Director  Option Plan (the "Amended 1996 Plan").  Under the plan,
Directors who are not currently employed by the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company  and have not been so  employed  within  the  preceding  six  months are
eligible to receive  options  from time to time to purchase the number of shares
of Common Stock  determined by the Board in its discretion;  provided,  however,
that no Director is permitted to receive  options to purchase more than 5 shares
of Common Stock in any one calendar  year. The exercise price for such shares is
the fair market  value  thereof on the date of grant,  and the  options  vest as
determined  in each case by the Board of  Directors.  Options  granted under the
Amended  1996 Plan must be exercised  within 10 years from the date of grant.  A
maximum of 200 shares of Common Stock are subject to issuance  under the Amended
1996 Plan, as amended.  The plan is administered by the Board of Directors.  The
Amended 1996 Plan expired by its terms on January 2, 2006.

     In 1996, the Board of Directors  granted a non-plan,  non-qualified  option
for 10 shares to an  individual,  who was not an  employee  or  director  of the
Company at the time of the  grant.  The option  was  originally  exercisable  at
$10.25 per share and  expired in 2006.  This  option was  repriced  to $6.88 per
share on September 17, 1998.

     In May 2005,  the  stockholders  of the Company  approved the 2005 Employee
Equity  Incentive Plan (the "Employee  Plan").  The Employee Plan authorizes the
Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors (the  "Committee")  to grant a
maximum  of 500 shares of equity  based and other  performance  based  awards to
executive  officers  and other  key  employees  of the  Company.  The  Committee
determines  the optionees and the terms of the awards granted under the Employee
Plan, including the type of awards,  exercise price, number of shares subject to
the award and the exercisability thereof.

     In May 2005,  the  stockholders  of the Company  approved the 2005 Director
Equity  Incentive Plan (the "Director  Plan").  The Director Plan authorizes the
Board of  Directors  (the  "Board")  to grant a maximum  of 200 shares of equity
based and  other  performance  based  awards to non  employee  directors  of the

     The  Company  has  recorded  $568 and  $1,788  of short  term and long term
deferred tax assets,  respectively,  as of December 31, 2006,  since it projects
recovering  these  benefits over the next three to five years.  The Company also
considered various tax strategies in arriving at the carrying amount of deferred
tax assets.  A valuation  allowance has been recorded against the balance of the
long-term   deferred  tax  benefits  since   management  does  not  believe  the
realization  of these benefits is more likely than not. As of December 31, 2006,
the Company  had a federal net  operating  loss carry  forward of  approximately
$8,619, which will begin to expire in the year 2023.

<b>Note 13 - Discontinued  Operations and Sale of BTT  (Subscribers and passings in
     whole numbers)</b>

     In June 2002 the Company  acquired  its initial  ownership  interest in BDR
Broadband,  LLC and in October 2006 acquired the 10% minority  interest that had
been owned by Priority Systems, LLC for nominal consideration. In June 2002, BDR
acquired certain rights-of-entry for multiple dwelling unit cable television and
high-speed data systems (the "Systems"). As a result of BDR acquiring additional
rights-of-entry,  at the time of divesture in December  2006,  BDR owned Systems
for  approximately  25  MDU  properties  in the  State  of  Texas,  representing
approximately  3,300 MDU cable  television  subscribers and 8,400 passings.  The
Systems were upgraded with  approximately  $81 and 799 of interdiction and other
products of the Company  during 2006 and 2005,  respectively.  During 2004,  two
Systems located outside of Texas were sold.

      On December 15, 2006, Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc. (the "Company") and
its wholly-owned  subsidiary,  BDR Broadband,  LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company  ("BDR"),   entered  into  a  Membership   Interest  Purchase  Agreement
("Purchase  Agreement")  with  DirecPath  Holdings,   LLC,  a  Delaware  limited
liability  company  ("DirecPath")  pursuant to which the Company sold all of the
issued  and  outstanding  membership  interests  of BDR to  DirecPath.  BDR owns
rights-of-entry  to provide video and high-speed data services to  approximately
25 multi-dwelling unit communities in the State of Texas. The sale was completed
on December 15, 2006.

     Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, DirecPath paid the Company an aggregate
purchase price of $3,130 in cash, subject to certain  post-closing  adjustments,
including  an  adjustment  for cash,  an  adjustment  for  working  capital  and
adjustments  related to the number of subscribers for certain types of services,
all as of the closing date and as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. A portion
of the purchase  price,  $490,  was  deposited  into an escrow  account,  and is
included as part of the prepaid and other current assets,  pursuant to an Escrow
Agreement  dated December 15, 2006,  among the Company,  DirecPath and U.S. Bank
National Association,  to secure the Company&#146;s indemnification obligations under
the Purchase Agreement.

     In addition, in connection with the purchase  transaction,  on December 15,
2006,   the  Company   entered  into  a  Purchase  and  Supply   Agreement  with
DirecPath,LLC,  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of DirecPath  ("DPLLC"),  pursuant to
which  DPLLC will  purchase  $1,630 of  products  from the  Company,  subject to
certain  adjustments,  over a period of three (3) years  beginning no later than
June 13,  2007.  The period in which DPLLC is  required to satisfy the  purchase
commitment may be extended upon the occurrence of certain  events,  including if
the Company is unable to deliver the  products  required by DPLLC.  The Purchase
Agreement  includes  customary  representations  and warranties and post-closing
covenants,   including   indemnification   obligations,   subject   to   certain
limitations,  on behalf of the parties  with  respect to their  representations,
warranties and agreements made pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.  In addition,
except for certain activities by Hybrid Networks, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company, the Company agreed, for a period of two (2) years, not to engage
in any business that competes with BDR.

     In connection with the Purchase Agreement,  the Company also entered into a
Transition Services Agreement with DirecPath, pursuant to which the Company will
provide  certain  administrative  and  other  services  to  DirecPath  during  a
ninety-day transition period.

     As a  result  of the  above,  the  Company  reflected  the sale of BDR as a
discontinued operation.  Components of the loss from discontinued operations are
as follows:

     In March,  2003, the Company entered into a series of agreements,  pursuant
to which the Company acquired a 20% minority interest in NetLinc Communications,
LLC ("NetLinc")  and a 35% minority  interest in Blonder Tongue  Telephone,  LLC
("BTT") (to which the Company had licensed  its name).  The  aggregate  purchase
price  consisted of (i) up to $3,500  payable over a minimum of two years,  plus
(ii) 500 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. NetLinc owns patents, proprietary
technology and know-how for certain  telephony  products that allow  Competitive

Local  Exchange  Carriers  ("CLECs") to  competitively  provide voice service to
MDUs.  Certain  distributorship  agreements were also concurrently  entered into
among  NetLinc,  BTT and the Company  pursuant  to which the Company  ultimately
acquired the right to  distribute  NetLinc&#146;s  telephony  products to private and
franchise cable operators as well as to all buyers for use in MDU  applications.
BTT partners  with CLECs to offer  primary  voice  service to MDUs,  receiving a
portion of the line  charges due from the CLECs&#146;  telephone  customers,  and the
Company  offers for sale a line of telephony  equipment to complement  the voice
service.

     As a result of  NetLinc&#146;s  inability to retain a contract  manufacturer  to
manufacture  and  supply  the  products  in a timely  and  consistent  manner in
accordance  with the requisite  specifications,  in September,  2003 the parties
agreed to restructure  the terms of their business  arrangement  entered into in
March, 2003. The restructured  business arrangement was accomplished by amending
certain of the agreements  previously entered into and entering into certain new
agreements.  Some of the principal terms of the restructured arrangement include
increasing  the Company&#146;s  economic  ownership in NetLinc from 20% to 50% and in
BTT from 35% to 50%, all at no additional cost to the Company.  The cash portion
of the purchase price in the venture was decreased from $3,500 to $1,167 and the
then outstanding  balance of $342 was paid in installments of $50 per week until
it was paid in full in October, 2003. BTT had an obligation to redeem the $1,167
cash  component  of  the  purchase   price  to  the  Company  via   preferential
distributions  of cash flow under  BTT&#146;s  limited  liability  company  operating
agreement.  In addition,  of the 500 shares of common stock issued to BTT as the
non-cash component of the purchase price (fair valued at $1,030),  one-half (250
shares) have been pledged to the Company as collateral.  Under the  restructured
arrangement,  the Company can purchase similar telephony  products directly from
third party  suppliers  other than NetLinc  and, in  connection  therewith,  the
Company would pay certain  future  royalties to NetLinc and BTT from the sale of
these  products  by the  Company.  While the  distributorship  agreements  among
NetLinc,  BTT and the Company  have not been  terminated,  the Company  does not
anticipate purchasing products from NetLinc. NetLinc, however,  continues to own
intellectual  property,  which could be further developed and used in the future
to manufacture and sell telephony products under the distributorship agreements,
although the Company has no present intention to do so.



     On June 30, 2006, the Company  entered into a Share Exchange and Settlement
Agreement  ("Share Exchange  Agreement") with BTT and certain related parties of
BTT.  Pursuant  to the Share  Exchange  Agreement,  in  exchange  for all of the
membership  shares  of  BTT  owned  by  the  Company  (the  "<b>BTT  Shares</b>"),  BTT
transferred  back to the Company the 500 shares of the  Company&#146;s  common  stock
that were  previously  contributed  by the  Company  to the  capital of BTT (the
"Company Common Stock"). The 500 shares of the acquired Company common stock was
recorded  as  treasury  stock at the  carrying  value  ($886)  of the  Company&#146;s
investment in Blonder  Tongue  Telephone  LLC on the date of the Share  Exchange
Agreement.  Under the terms of the Share  Exchange  Agreement,  the parties also
agreed to the following:



o    the Company granted BTT a non-transferable equipment purchase credit in the
     aggregate  amount of $400 (subject to certain  off-sets as set forth in the
     Share Exchange Agreement); two-thirds (2/3rds) of which ($270) must be used
     solely for the purchase of telephony  equipment and the remaining one-third
     (1/3rd)  of which  ($130) may be used for either  video/data  equipment  or
     telephony equipment;

o    the equipment credit would have expired automatically on December 31, 2006,
     but it was exercised in full by September 30, 2006;

o    certain non-material agreements were terminated,  including the Amended and
     Restated  Operating  Agreement of BTT among the Company,  BTT and remaining
     member of BTT, the Joint  Venture  Agreement  among the  Company,  BTT, and
     certain related parties, the Royalty Agreement between the Company and BTT,
     and the Stock  Pledge  Agreement  between the  Company and BTT,  each dated
     September 11, 2003 (collectively, the "Prior Agreements");

o    BTT agreed, within ninety (90) days, to change its corporate name and cease
     using  any  intellectual  property  of  the  Company,  including,   without
     limitation, the names "Blonder", "Blonder Tongue" or "BT"; and

<b>Note 14 - Other Income</b>

     During   September   2002,   the  Company  sold  inventory  at  a  cost  of
approximately  $1,447 to a private cable  operator for  approximately  $1,929 in
exchange for which the Company received notes receivable in the principal amount
of  approximately  $1,929.  The notes were payable by the customer in 48 monthly
principal and interest (at 11.5%)  installments of approximately  $51 commencing
January  1,  2003.  The  customer&#146;s  payment  obligations  under the notes  were
collateralized  by purchase money liens on the inventory sold and blanket second
liens on all other  assets of the  customer.  The Company has recorded the notes
receivable  at the  inventory  cost and did not  recognize  any revenue or gross
profit  on the  transaction  until a  substantial  amount  of the  cost had been
recovered,  and  collectibility  was assured.  The Company collected $612 during
2003 and recorded the  receipts as a reduction in the note  receivable  balance.
The balance of the notes was  collected  during 2004 and  approximately  $482 of
gross margin and $356 of interest income was recognized.

forth in the  Purchase  Agreement.  A portion of  the purchase  price ($490) was
deposited into a escrow account,  pursuant to an Escrow Agreement dated December
15, 2006, among the Company,  DirecPath and U.S. Bank National  Association,  to
securethe  Company&#146;s  indemnification  obligations under the Purchase Agreement
(see Note 13).

On March 15, 2007, the Company received a Final Purchase Price  Certificate (the
"Certificate") as defined under the Purchase Agreement.  The  Certificate states
various  purchase price  adjustments  aggregating approximately  $970 are due to
DirecPath.  The Company is in the early stages of evaluating the claims outlined
in the  Certificate.  At this time, the Company does not believe the claims have
any merit and  intends to file a  Disputed  Items  Notice  within the sixty days
period allowed under the Purchase Agreement.
