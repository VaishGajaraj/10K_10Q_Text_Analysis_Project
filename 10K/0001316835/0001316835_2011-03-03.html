<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>OVERVIEW</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Builders FirstSource, Inc. is a leading supplier and manufacturer of structural and related
building products for residential new construction. We have operations principally in the southern
and eastern United States with 52 distribution centers and 47 manufacturing facilities, many of
which are located on the same premises as our distribution centers. We have successfully acquired
and integrated 27 companies since our formation and are currently managed as three regional
operating groups &#151; Atlantic, Southeast and Central &#151; with centralized financial and operational
oversight. In this annual report, references to the &#147;company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;ours&#148; or &#147;us&#148; refer to
Builders FirstSource, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated or the
context otherwise requires.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Builders FirstSource, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in 1998, as BSL Holdings, Inc. On
October&nbsp;13, 1999, we changed our name to Builders FirstSource, Inc. Publicly held since
2005, our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the ticker symbol &#147;BLDR&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>OUR INDUSTRY</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We compete in the professional segment (&#147;Pro Segment&#148;) of the U.S. residential new
construction building products supply market. Suppliers in the Pro Segment primarily focus on
serving professional customers such as homebuilders and remodeling contractors. According to the
National Association of Home Builders (&#147;NAHB&#148;), the single family residential construction market
was an estimated $112.8&nbsp;billion in 2010, down approximately 73% from the historical high of $413.2
billion in 2006. The Pro Segment of this market consists predominantly of small, privately owned
suppliers including framing and shell construction contractors, local and regional materials
distributors, single or multi-site lumberyards, and truss manufacturing and millwork operations.
Because of the predominance of smaller privately owned companies and the overall size and diversity
of the target customer market, the Pro Segment remains fragmented. There were only six building
product suppliers in the Pro Segment that generated more than $500&nbsp;million in sales according to
<I>ProSales </I>magazine&#146;s 2009 ProSales 100 list. On this list, we were the fifth largest building
product supplier in 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our industry is driven primarily by the residential new construction market, which is in turn
dependent upon a number of factors, including demographic trends, interest rates, employment
levels, supply and demand for housing stock, availability of credit, foreclosure rates, consumer
confidence and the economy in general. The homebuilding industry has experienced a significant and
sustained downturn over the past few years due to negative trends in many of the factors listed
above. During this downturn, many homebuilders have significantly decreased their starts because of
lower demand and a surplus of both existing and new home inventory. The weakness
in the homebuilding industry has resulted in a significant reduction in demand for our products and
services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to the pressure on the housing industry are the severe limitations on credit
availability for smaller homebuilders and homebuyers. Beginning in 2007, the mortgage markets
experienced substantial disruption due to increased defaults, primarily as a

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">result of credit quality deterioration. This disruption resulted in a stricter regulatory
environment and reduced availability of mortgages for potential homebuyers due to an illiquid
credit market and more restrictive standards to qualify for mortgages. Mortgage financing and
commercial credit for smaller homebuilders continue to be severely constrained, which is adding to
the severity of the downturn in our industry. However, we believe there are several meaningful
trends that indicate U.S. housing demand will likely recover in the long term. These trends include
still near record-low interest rates, the aging of housing stock, and normal population growth due
to birthrate exceeding death rate. In fact, 2010 was the first time in the past five years that
the housing industry experienced an increase in starts as, according to the U.S. Census Bureau,
actual single family housing starts in the U.S. during 2010 increased 5.9% from 2009. The NAHB is
also predicting that U.S. housing starts will increase in 2011 to approximately 555,000 single
family housing starts. This level for 2011 would represent a 17.8% increase from 2010 actual
housing starts.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>OUR CUSTOMERS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We serve a broad customer base ranging from production homebuilders to small custom
homebuilders. We believe we have a diverse geographic footprint as we serve 32 markets in 9 states.
According to 2010 U.S. Census data, we have operations in 17 of the top 50 U.S. Metropolitan
Statistical Areas, as ranked by single family housing permits in 2010. In addition, approximately
44% of U.S. housing permits in 2010 were issued in states in which we operate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our customer mix is a balance of large national homebuilders, regional homebuilders, and local
builders. Our customer base is highly diversified. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, our top 10
customers accounted for approximately 23.8% of our sales, and no single customer accounted for more
than 5% of our sales. Our top 10 customers are comprised primarily of the largest production
homebuilders, including publicly traded companies such as Beazer Homes USA, D.R. Horton, Inc.,
Lennar Corp., Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., Pulte Homes, Inc. (including Centex Corp.), and The
Ryland Group, Inc.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the largest production homebuilders, we also service and supply regional and
local custom homebuilders. Custom homebuilders require high levels of service; our sales team must
work very closely with the designers on a day-to-day basis in order to ensure the appropriate
products are produced and delivered to the building site. To account for these increased service
costs, pricing in the industry is tied to the level of service provided and the volumes purchased.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our primary focus has been on single-family residential construction, over the past
several years we have expanded our multi-family and light commercial business to further diversify
our customer base and lessen our dependence on the single-family market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We offer an integrated solution to our customers providing manufacturing, supply, and
installation of a full range of structural and related building products. We distribute a wide
variety of building products and services directly to homebuilder customers. In addition, we
manufacture floor trusses, roof trusses, wall panels, stairs, millwork, windows, and doors. In
addition to our full range of construction services, we provide a comprehensive offering of
products that includes approximately 62,000 stock keeping units (&#147;SKUs&#148;). We believe our broad
product and service offering combined with our scale and experienced sales force have driven market
share gains, particularly with production homebuilders, and will help us to maintain our customer
base during the downturn in the housing industry.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We group our building products and services into five product categories: prefabricated
components, windows &#038; doors, lumber &#038; lumber sheet goods, millwork, and other building products &#038;
services. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, our combined sales of prefabricated components,
windows &#038; doors and millwork product categories represented 53.1% of total sales. Each of these
categories includes both manufactured and distributed products. Products in these categories
typically carry a higher margin and provide us with opportunities to cross-sell other products and
services, thereby increasing customer penetration. Sales by product category for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 can be found under the caption &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; contained in Item&nbsp;7 of this annual
report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Prefabricated Components. </I>Prefabricated components are factory-built substitutes for job
site-framing and include floor trusses, roof trusses, wall panels, stairs, and engineered wood that
we design and cut for each home. Our manufactured prefabricated components allow builders to build
higher quality homes more efficiently. Roof trusses, floor trusses, wall panels and stair units are
built in a factory controlled environment. Engineered floors and beams are cut to the required size
and packaged for the given application at many of our locations. Without prefabricated components,
builders construct these items on site, where weather and variable labor quality can negatively
impact construction cost, quality and installation time. In addition, engineered wood beams have
greater structural strength than conventional framing materials, allowing builders to frame houses
with more open space creating a wider variety of house designs. Engineered wood floors are stronger
and straighter than conventionally framed floors.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the current housing downturn, homebuilders were increasingly using prefabricated
components in order to realize increased efficiency and improved quality. Shortening cycle time
from start to completion was a key imperative of the homebuilders during periods of strong consumer
demand. With the current housing downturn, that trend has decelerated as cycle time has less
relevance. Customers who traditionally used prefabricated components, for the most part still do.
However, the conversion of customers to this product offering has slowed. We expect this trend to
continue at least for the duration of this downturn. In response, we have reduced our manufacturing
capacity and delayed plans to open new facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Windows &#038; Doors. </I>The windows &#038; doors category comprises the manufacturing, assembly and
distribution of windows, and the assembly and distribution of interior and exterior door units. We
manufacture aluminum and vinyl windows in our plant in Houston, Texas which allows us to supply
builders, primarily in the Texas market, with an adequate supply of cost-competitive products. Our
pre-hung interior and exterior doors consist of a door slab with hinges and door jambs attached,
reducing on-site installation time and providing higher quality finished door units than those
constructed on site. These products typically require a high degree of product knowledge and
training to sell. As we continue to emphasize higher margin product lines, we expect value-added
goods like windows &#038; doors to increasingly contribute to our sales and overall profitability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Lumber &#038; Lumber Sheet Goods. </I>Lumber &#038; lumber sheet goods include dimensional lumber, plywood
and oriented strand board (&#147;OSB&#148;) products used in on-site house framing. In 2010, this product
line increased as a percentage of our total sales to 28.8% primarily due to the unprecedented
commodity inflation seen during the first half of the year. However, lumber and lumber sheet goods
as a percentage of our total sales has declined significantly since 2004 when it represented 39.6%
of sales. This change in product mix has been due in part to a shift in builder demand toward
prefabricated components for their framing needs. Despite this shift in product mix, we believe we
have grown our market share for lumber &#038; lumber sheet goods over this time period. We expect the
lumber &#038; lumber sheet goods business to remain a stable revenue source in the future, but to grow
over the long-term at a slower rate than our other business lines.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Millwork. </I>Millwork includes interior trim, exterior trim, columns and posts that we
distribute, as well as custom exterior features that we manufacture
under the
Synboard<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top"><FONT style="FONT-variant: SMALL-CAPS">tm</FONT></sup>
brand name. Synboard is produced from extruded PVC and offers several advantages over traditional
wood features, such as greater durability and no ongoing maintenance such as periodic caulking and
painting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other Building Products &#038; Services. </I>Other building products &#038; services consist of various
products, including cabinets, gypsum, roofing and insulation. This category also includes services
such as turn-key framing, shell construction, design assistance and professional installation of
products spanning all our product categories. We provide professional installation and turn-key
services as a solution for our homebuilder customers. Through our installation services program, we
help homebuilders realize efficiencies through improved scheduling, resulting in reduced cycle time
and better cost controls. We believe these services require scale, capital and sophistication that
smaller competitors do not possess.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>MANUFACTURING</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing facilities utilize the latest technology and the highest quality materials
to improve product quality, increase efficiency, reduce lead times and minimize production errors.
As a result, we believe we incur significantly lower engineering and set-up costs than do our
competitors, contributing to improved margins and customer satisfaction. We manufacture products
within three of our product categories: prefabricated components, millwork, and windows and doors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Prefabricated Components &#151; Trusses and Wall Panels. </I>Truss and wall panel production has two
steps &#151; design and fabrication. Each house requires its own set of designed shop drawings, which
vary by builder type: production versus custom builders. Production builders use prototype house
plans as they replicate houses. These house plans may be minimally modified to suit individual
customer demand. The number of changes made to a given prototype house, and the number of prototype
houses used, varies by builder and their construction and sales philosophy. We maintain an
electronic master file of trusses and wall panels for each builder&#146;s prototype houses. There are
three primary benefits to master filing. First, master filing is cost effective as the electronic
master file is used rather than designing the components individually each time the prototype house
is built. Second, it improves design quality as a house&#146;s design is based on the proven prototype
except for any minor builder modifications. Third, master filing allows us to change one file and
update all related prototype house designs automatically as we improve the design over time or as
the builder modifies the base prototype house. We do not maintain a master file for custom builders
who do not replicate houses, as it is not cost effective. For these builders, the components are
designed individually for each house.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we design shop drawings for a given house, we download the shop drawings into a
proprietary software system to review the design for potential errors and to schedule the job for
production. The fabrication process begins by cutting individual pieces of lumber to required
lengths in accordance with the shop drawings. We download the shop drawings from our design
department to computerized saws. We assemble the cut lumber to form roof trusses, floor trusses or
wall panels, and store the finished components by house awaiting shipment to the job site.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We generate fabrication time standards for each component during the design step. We use these
standards to measure efficiency by comparing actual production time with the calculated standard.
Each plant&#146;s performance is benchmarked by comparing efficiency across plants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Prefabricated Components &#151; Engineered Wood. </I>As with trusses and wall panels, engineered wood
components have a design and fabrication step. We design engineered wood floors using a master
filing system similar to the truss and wall panel system. Engineered wood beams are designed to
ensure the beam will be structurally sound in the given application. After the design phase, a
printed layout is generated. We use this layout to cut the engineered wood to the required length
and assemble all of the components into a house package. We then install the components on the job
site. We design and fabricate engineered wood at the majority of our distribution locations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Prefabricated Components &#151; Stairs. </I>We manufacture box stairs at several of our locations.
After a house is framed, our salesman takes measurements at the job site prior to manufacturing to
account for any variation between the blueprints and the actual framed house. We fabricate box
stairs based on these measurements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Custom Millwork. </I>Our manufactured custom millwork consists primarily of synthetic exterior
trim, custom windows, features and box columns that we sell throughout our company under our Synboard brand name.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sand, cut, and shape sheets of 4 foot by 18 or 20 foot Celuka-blown, extruded PVC
(&#147;Synboard&#148;) to produce the desired product. We produce exterior trim boards by cutting the
Synboard into the same industry-standard dimensions used for wood-based exterior trim boards. We
form exterior features by assembling pieces of Synboard and other PVC-based moldings that have been
cut, heated and bent over forms to achieve the desired shape. For custom windows, we build the
frame from Synboard and glaze the glass into place. We fabricate box columns from sections of PVC
that are cut on a 45 degree angle and mitered together.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Windows. </I>We manufacture a full line of traditional aluminum and vinyl windows at an
approximately 200,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Houston, Texas. The process
begins by purchasing aluminum and vinyl lineal extrusions. We cut these extrusions to size and join
them together to form the window frame and sash. We then purchase sheet glass and cut it to size.
We combine two pieces of identically shaped glass with a sealing compound to create a glass unit
with improved insulating capability. We then insert the sealed glass unit and glaze it into the
window frame and sash. The unit is completed when we install a balance to operate the window and
add a lock to secure the window in a closed position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pre-hung Doors. </I>We pre-hang interior and exterior doors at many of our locations. We insert
door slabs and pre-cut door jambs into a door machine, which bores holes into the doors for the
door hardware and applies the jambs and hinges to the door slab. We then apply the casing that
frames interior doors at a separate station. Exterior doors do not have a casing, and instead may
have sidelights applied to the sides of the door, a transom attached over the top of the door unit
and a door sill applied to the threshold.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>OUR STRATEGY</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long-term strategy is to leverage our competitive strengths to grow sales, earnings, and
cash flow and remain a preferred supplier to the homebuilding industry. We have modified our
strategy in response to the extended downturn that has affected our industry. Our strategy during
the housing downturn is to maximize financial performance without impairing our ability to compete
and create value in the long term. We have implemented this strategy through generating new
business, focusing on cost, working capital and operating improvements, and most importantly
conserving cash.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Expand Current Customer Base. </I>In recent years, the homebuilding industry has undergone
significant consolidation, with the larger homebuilders substantially increasing their market
share. In accordance with this trend, our customer base has increasingly shifted to production
homebuilders. We intend to leverage our business model, geographic breadth and scale to continue to
grow our sales to the production homebuilders as they continue to gain market share. We increased
sales to our 10 largest production homebuilders from 21.8% of our net sales for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2009 to 23.8% of our net sales for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. During 2010,
sales to our top 10 production homebuilders increased 12.7% compared to our net sales to these same
customers in 2009. We expect that our ability to maintain strong relationships with the largest
builders will be vital to our ability to grow and expand into new markets as well as maintain our
current market share through the downturn. Additionally, during the downturn, we will continue with
our plan to prudently expand our presence in the custom homebuilder base while still adhering to
our tight credit standards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Expand into Multi-Family and Light Commercial Business. </I>We believe we can diversify our
customer base and grow our sales by further expanding into the multi-family and light commercial
business. While we primarily serve the single family new home construction market, we continue to
look for ways to expand our multi-family and/or light commercial market in certain regions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Focus on Cost, Working Capital and Operating Improvements. </I>We are extremely focused on
expenses and working capital to remain a low cost supplier. We maintain a continuous improvement,
&#147;best practices&#148; operating philosophy and regularly implement new initiatives to reduce costs,
increase efficiency and reduce working capital. For example, we have linked our computer system to
those of some customers to streamline the administrative aspects of the quoting, invoicing and
billing processes. We also analyze our workforce productivity to determine the optimal labor mix
that minimizes cost, and examine our logistics function to reduce the cost of inbound freight. Our
focus on cost controls, working capital and operating improvements is particularly important during
this downturn. Our largest controllable cost is our salaries and wages. Since the beginning of the
housing downturn in March&nbsp;2006, we have reduced our average full time equivalent headcount,
excluding discontinued operations, by 60.3%. We have been thoughtful in reducing our headcount as a
number of the reductions were the result of identifying and implementing operating efficiencies. We
were also able to reduce office general and administrative expenses by $5.3&nbsp;million for 2010, among
other reductions. Industry forecasters are predicting that single family housing starts
will show improvements in 2011 which could require us to increase our operating expenses,
headcount and working capital in order to support the additional demand. We will attempt to
minimize these increases to ensure that we prudently adjust our variable costs with the change in
housing starts. We continue to be diligently focused on the controllable aspects of working
capital, including days sales outstanding, inventory turns and accounts payable days outstanding.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Conserve Cash. </I>During a downturn, we realize the importance of acting quickly to conserve
capital. We pulled back our capital expenditures in 2009 and 2008 to maintenance capital levels.
In 2010, we increased our capital expenditures due primarily to buyouts of expiring vehicle and
equipment leases. We also manage our credit tightly, especially in these conditions. As industry
conditions deteriorate, we know it is important to extend credit prudently for a higher probability
of collection on our accounts receivable. Our bad debt expense decreased $1.9&nbsp;million in 2010
compared to 2009, as a result of our tighter credit policies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. </I>The highly fragmented nature of the Pro Segment of the U.S.
residential new construction building products supply market presents substantial acquisition
opportunities. Our long-term acquisition strategy, subject to our ability to secure long-term
capital, centers on the continued growth of our prefabricated components business and on the
potential for geographic expansion. First, we will selectively seek to acquire companies that
manufacture prefabricated components such as roof and floor trusses, wall panels, stairs, and
engineered wood, as well as other building products such as millwork. We will also seek to acquire
companies that present an opportunity to add manufacturing capabilities in a relatively short
period of time. Second, there are a number of attractive homebuilding markets where we do not
currently operate. We believe that our proven operating model can be successfully adapted to these
markets and that the homebuilders in these markets, many of whom we currently serve elsewhere,
would value our broad product and service offering, professional expertise, and superior customer
service. When entering a new market, our strategy is to acquire market-leading distributors and
subsequently expand their product offerings and/or add manufacturing facilities while integrating
their operations into our centralized platform. This strategy allows us to quickly achieve the
scale required to maximize profitability and leverage existing customer relationships in the local
market. Our senior management team has the experience and ability to identify acquisition
candidates and integrate acquisitions, having acquired and integrated 27 companies since 1998.
There may be opportunities for industry consolidation in 2011 and we would like to be at the
forefront of this trend. However, liquidity is our primary area of focus in 2011, and therefore we
will review potential acquisitions in light of our projected liquidity needs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>SALES AND MARKETING</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seek to attract and retain customers through exceptional customer service, leading product
quality, broad product and service offerings, and competitive pricing. This strategy is centered on
building and maintaining strong customer relationships rather than traditional marketing and
advertising. We strive to add value for the homebuilders through shorter lead times, lower material
costs, faster project completion and higher quality. By executing this strategy, we believe we will
continue to generate new business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experienced locally focused sales force is at the core of our sales effort. This sales
effort involves deploying salespeople who are skilled in housing construction to meet with a
homebuilder&#146;s construction superintendent, local purchasing agent, or local executive with the goal
of becoming the primary product supplier. If selected by the homebuilder, the salesperson and his
or her team of experts review blueprints for the contracted homes and advise the homebuilder in
areas such as opportunities for cost reduction and regional aesthetic preferences. Next, the team
determines the specific package of our products that are needed to complete the project and
schedules a sequence of site deliveries. Our large delivery fleet and comprehensive inventory
management system enable us to provide &#147;just-in-time&#148; product delivery, ensuring a smoother and
faster production cycle for the homebuilder. Throughout the construction process, the salesperson
makes frequent site visits to ensure timely delivery and proper installation and to make
suggestions for efficiency improvements. We believe this level of service is highly valued by our
customers and generates significant customer loyalty. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we employed
approximately 344 sales representatives, who are typically paid a commission based on gross margin
dollars collected and work with approximately 189 sales coordinators and product specialists.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>BACKLOG</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the nature of our business, backlog information is not meaningful. While our customers
may provide an estimate of their future needs, in most cases we do not receive a firm order from
them until just prior to the anticipated delivery dates. Accordingly, in many cases the time frame
from receipt of a firm order and shipment does not exceed a few days.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>MATERIALS AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We purchase inventory primarily for distribution, some of which is also utilized in our
manufacturing plants. The key materials we purchase include dimensional lumber, OSB, engineered
wood, windows, doors, and millwork. Our largest suppliers are national lumber and wood products
producers and distributors such as BlueLinx Holdings Inc., Boise Cascade Company, U.S. Lumber,
Canfor Wood Products and Weyerhaeuser Company and building products manufacturers such as Masonite
International Corporation, M I Windows and Doors and Ply Gem Windows. We believe there is
sufficient supply in the marketplace to competitively source most of our requirements without
reliance on any particular supplier and that our diversity of suppliers affords us purchasing
flexibility. Due to our centralized oversight of purchasing and our large lumber and OSB purchasing
volumes, we believe we are better able to maximize the advantages of both our and our suppliers&#146;
broad footprints and negotiate purchases in multiple markets to achieve more favorable contracts
with respect to price, terms of sale, and supply than our regional competitors. Additionally, for
certain customers, we institute purchasing programs on raw materials such as OSB to align portions
of our procurement costs with our pricing commitments. We balance our lumber and OSB purchases with
a mix of contract and spot market purchases to ensure consistent quantities of product necessary to
fulfill customer contracts, to source products at the lowest possible cost, and to minimize our
exposure to the volatility of commodity lumber prices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently source products from approximately 3,300 suppliers in order to reduce our
dependence on any single company and to maximize purchasing leverage. Although no materials
purchased from any single supplier represented more than 9% of our total materials purchased in
2010, we believe we are one of the largest customers for many suppliers, and therefore have
significant purchasing leverage. We have found that using multiple suppliers ensures a stable
source of products and the best purchasing terms as the suppliers compete to gain and maintain our
business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain strong relationships with our suppliers, and we believe opportunities exist to
improve purchasing terms in the future, including inventory storage or &#147;just-in-time&#148; delivery to
reduce our inventory carrying costs. We believe we can obtain additional procurement cost savings
and purchasing synergies which would further enhance our margins and cash flow.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>COMPETITION</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the decline in housing starts, we have and will continue to experience increased
competition for homebuilder business. Many of our competitors in the Pro Segment market are
small, privately owned companies, including framing and shell construction
contractors, local and regional materials distributors, single or multi-site lumberyards, and truss
manufacturing and millwork operations. Most of these companies have limited access to capital and
lack sophisticated information technology systems and large-scale procurement capabilities. We
believe we have substantial competitive advantages over these smaller competitors due to our
long-standing customer relationships, local market knowledge and competitive pricing. Our largest
competitors in our markets are 84 Lumber Co. (a privately held company), Stock Building Supply (a
privately held company, majority owned by Gores Group) and Pro-Build Holdings, Inc. (a privately
held company, formerly Strober Organization).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We compete in the Pro Segment of the U.S. residential new construction building products
supply market. According to 2010 U.S. Census data, we have operations in 17 of the top 50 U.S.
Metropolitan Statistical Areas, as ranked by single family housing permits, and approximately 44%
of U.S. housing permits in 2010 were issued in states in which we operate. We focus on a distinctly
different target market than the home center retailers such as The Home Depot and Lowe&#146;s, who
currently primarily serve do-it-yourself and professional remodeling customers. By contrast, our
customers consist of professional homebuilders and those that provide construction services to
them, with whom we develop strong relationships. The principal methods of competition in the Pro
Segment are the development of long-term relationships with professional builders and retaining
such customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products on time and offering trade
credit, competitive pricing, flexibility in transaction processing, and integrated service and
product packages, such as turn-key framing and shell construction, as well as prefabricated
components and installation. Our leading market positions in the highly competitive Pro Segment
create economies of scale that allow us to cost-effectively supply our customers, which both
enhances profitability and reduces the risk of losing customers to competitors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>EMPLOYEES</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had approximately 2,500 full-time equivalent employees, none of whom
were represented by a union. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our primary enterprise resource planning (&#147;ERP&#148;) system, which we use for operations
representing approximately 98% of our sales, is a proprietary system that has been highly
customized by our computer programmers. The system has been designed to operate our businesses in a
highly efficient manner. The materials required for thousands of standard builder plans are stored
by the system for rapid quoting or order entry. Hundreds of price lists are maintained on thousands
of SKUs, facilitating rapid price changes in changing product cost environments. A customer&#146;s order
can be tracked at each stage of the process and billing can be customized to reduce a customer&#146;s
administrative costs and speed payment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a single financial reporting system that has been highly customized for our business.
Consolidated financial, sales and workforce reporting is integrated using Hyperion Business
Intelligence system, which aggregates data from our ERP systems along with workforce information
from our third-party payroll administrator. This technology platform provides management with
robust corporate and location level performance management by leveraging standardized metrics and
analytics allowing us to plan, track and report performance and compensation measures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed a proprietary program for use in our component plants. This software reviews
product designs for errors, schedules the plants and provides the data used to measure plant
efficiency. In addition, we have purchased several software products that have been integrated with
our primary ERP system. These programs assist in analyzing blueprints to generate material lists,
configure kitchen cabinet orders to submit to manufacturers and purchase lumber products at the
lowest cost.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition and level of working capital typically change during periods of increasing
sales as we carry more inventory and receivables. Working capital levels typically increase in the
second and third quarters of the year due to higher sales during the peak residential construction
season. These increases have in the past resulted in negative operating cash flows during this peak
season, which historically have been financed through available cash. Collection of receivables and
reduction in inventory levels following the peak building and construction season have in the past
helped to partially offset this negative cash flow. We have also from time to time utilized our
credit facility to cover working capital needs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks associated with our business, an investment in our securities, and with achieving the
forward-looking statements contained in this report or in our news releases, websites, public
filings, investor and analyst conferences or elsewhere, include, but are not limited to, the risk
factors described below. Any of the risk factors described below could cause our actual results to
differ materially from expectations and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or operating results. We may not succeed in addressing these challenges and
risks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>The industry in which we operate is dependent upon the homebuilding industry, the economy, the
credit markets, and other important factors.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building products industry is highly dependent on new home construction, which in turn is
dependent upon a number of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, employment
rates, foreclosure rates, and the health of the economy and mortgage markets. Unfavorable changes
in demographics, credit markets, consumer confidence, housing affordability, or inventory levels,
or weakening of the national economy or of any regional or local economy in which we operate, could
adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes, and adversely affect our
business. Production of new homes may also decline because of shortages of qualified tradesmen,
reliance on inadequately capitalized homebuilders and sub-contractors, and shortages of material.
In addition, the homebuilding industry is subject to various local, state, and federal statutes,
ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction,
energy conservation and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and
density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries
of a particular area. Increased regulatory restrictions could limit demand for new homes and could
negatively affect our sales and earnings. Because we have substantial fixed costs, relatively
modest declines in our customers&#146; production levels could have a significant adverse effect on our
financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homebuilding industry has been undergoing a significant and sustained downturn that began
in mid-2006. Challenging conditions still persist even as, according to the U.S. Census Bureau,
actual single family housing starts in the U.S. during 2010 increased 5.9% from 2009. We believe that the ongoing market downturn is attributable to a variety of
factors including: a severe economic recession, followed by an economic recovery that has been
modest to date; limited credit availability; excess home inventories; a substantial reduction in
speculative home investment; reduced consumer confidence; and soft housing demand. The downturn in
the homebuilding industry has resulted in a substantial reduction in demand for our

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, beginning in 2007, the mortgage markets experienced substantial disruption due to
increased defaults, primarily as a result of credit quality deterioration. The disruption has
continued to date and has resulted in a stricter regulatory environment and reduced availability of
mortgages for potential homebuyers due to an illiquid credit market, substantial declines in
housing prices, and tighter standards to qualify for mortgages. Mortgage financing and commercial
credit for smaller homebuilders continue to be severely constrained. As the housing industry is
dependent upon the economy and employment levels as well as potential homebuyers&#146; access to
mortgage financing and homebuilders&#146; access to commercial credit, it is likely that the housing
industry will not recover until conditions in the economy and the credit markets significantly
improve and unemployment rates decline.

the timing or strength of a future recovery of housing activity in our markets, if any. We also
cannot provide any assurances that the homebuilding industry will not weaken further or that the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $39.9&nbsp;million in continuing operations
related to our Florida reporting unit and $4.0&nbsp;million in discontinued operations, net of tax,
related to our Ohio reporting unit. During 2008, we also recorded impairment charges related to
long-lived assets, other than goodwill, of $7.0&nbsp;million in continuing operations and $0.1&nbsp;million
in discontinued operations, net of tax. During 2009, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.5
million in continuing operations to reduce the carrying value of a parcel of real estate being held
for sale. During 2010, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.8 in continuing operations related to
long-lived assets and land held for sale. If the current weakness in the homebuilding industry
continues, we may need to take additional goodwill and/or asset impairment charges relating to
certain of our reporting units. Any such non-cash charges would have an adverse effect on our
financial results. In addition, in response to industry and market conditions, we may have to close
certain facilities in under-performing markets, although we have no specific plans for additional
facility closures at this time. Any such facility closures could have a significant adverse effect
on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, our funded debt was approximately $165.0&nbsp;million, which consisted of
$20.0&nbsp;million of outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility, $139.7
million of our Second Priority Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due in 2016 (&#147;2016 notes&#148;), and
$5.3&nbsp;million of our remaining Floating Rate Notes due in 2012 (&#147;2012 notes&#148;). Our senior secured
revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in December&nbsp;2012, but will mature in November&nbsp;2011
if we have not repaid or extended the maturity of all of the outstanding 2012 notes by that time.
In addition, we have significant obligations under ongoing operating leases that are not reflected
in our balance sheet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, all of our funded debt was at a variable interest rate. If interest
rates rise, our interest expense would increase. However, interest expense on our 2016 notes, which
are subject to a 3% floor, would not change unless LIBOR increased to greater than 3%. Based on debt
outstanding and LIBOR rates at December&nbsp;31, 2010, a 1.0% increase in interest rates would result in
approximately $0.2&nbsp;million of additional interest expense annually.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations,
we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or
restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may
not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating
results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to
dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The credit
agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our
2016 notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and to use the proceeds from such
dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or be able to obtain the proceeds
that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service

results of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, our outstanding borrowings under this facility were
$20&nbsp;million, and our net available borrowing capacity in excess of our minimum liquidity covenant
was $22.6&nbsp;million. Our inability to borrow additional funds under this facility to fund our working

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic and credit market conditions, the performance of the homebuilding industry, and our

indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, the
availability of credit, economic conditions, and financial, business, and other factors, many of
which are beyond our control. The prolonged continuation or worsening of the current market and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, our net available borrowing capacity under our senior secured revolving
credit facility in excess of the required $10&nbsp;million liquidity covenant was $22.6&nbsp;million. This
covenant calculates as eligible borrowing base less outstanding borrowings. The resulting amount
must equal or exceed a minimum liquidity requirement, ranging from $10.0-$18.75&nbsp;million, or we are
required to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1, which we currently would not meet. The
fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of earnings before interest expenses, income
taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses minus capital expenditures, cash taxes paid,
dividends, distributions and share repurchases or redemptions to the sum of scheduled principal
payments and interest expense on a trailing 12&nbsp;month basis from the trigger date. Based on our
2011 forecast, we will not meet the fixed charge coverage ratio, but we anticipate that we will not
fall below the required minimum liquidity covenant in 2011 and therefore, will not trigger the
fixed charge coverage ratio requirement. The calculation allows cash on deposit with the agent to
be included as eligible borrowing base. Further declines in our borrowing base, if any, could
compel us to either repay outstanding borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility
or increase cash on deposit with the agent.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies.
Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the credit agreement governing our senior
secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2016 notes may be affected by
changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic
conditions, adverse regulatory developments, a change in control or other events beyond our
control. The breach of any of these covenants, including those contained in our senior secured
revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2016 notes, could result in a default
under our indebtedness, which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable. If
any of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay it.

leases at the end of their terms. If we close a facility, we are still obligated under the
applicable lease.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our facilities are located in leased premises. Many of our current leases are
non-cancelable and typically have initial terms ranging from 5 to 15&nbsp;years and most provide options
to renew for specified periods of time. We believe that leases we enter into in the future will
likely be long-term and non-cancelable and have similar renewal options. If we close or idle a
facility, most likely we remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease,
which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent, insurance, taxes, and other
expenses on the leased property for the balance of the lease term. During the period from 2007
through 2010, we closed or idled a number of facilities for which we remain liable on the lease
obligations. Our obligation to continue making rental payments in respect of leases for closed or
idled facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Alternatively, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a facility, we may be unable
to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we are unable to renew our
facility leases, we may close or relocate a facility, which could subject us to construction and
other costs and risks, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations. For example, closing a facility, even during the time of relocation, will
reduce the sales that the facility would have contributed to our revenues. Additionally, the
revenue and profit, if any, generated at a relocated facility may not equal the revenue and profit
generated at the existing one.

flows of our subsidiaries, which are paid to us by our subsidiaries in the form of dividends and
other payments or distributions, to meet our debt service obligations. The ability of our
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or distributions to us will depend on their
respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>The building supply industry is cyclical and seasonal.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building products supply industry is subject to cyclical market pressures. Prices of
building products are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national
and international economic conditions, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government
regulation, and trade policies, as well as from periodic delays in the delivery of lumber and other
products. For example, prices of wood products, including lumber and panel products, are subject to
significant volatility and directly affect our sales and earnings. In particular, low market prices
for wood products over a sustained period can adversely affect our financial condition, operating
results and cash flows, as can excessive spikes in market prices. For the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2010, average market prices for lumber and lumber sheet goods were 28.1% higher than the prior year primarily due to a sharp increase in market prices for lumber during the first six months of 2010. Our
lumber and lumber sheet goods product category represented 28.8% of total sales for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010. We have no ability to control the timing and amount of pricing changes for
building products. In addition, the supply of building products fluctuates based on available
manufacturing capacity. A shortage of capacity or excess capacity in the industry can result in
significant increases or declines in market prices for those products, often within a short period
of time. Such price fluctuations can adversely affect our financial condition, operating results
and cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year,
adverse weather historically has reduced construction activity in the first and fourth quarters in
our markets. To the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, floods, other natural disasters or
similar events occur in the markets in which we operate, our business may be adversely affected. We
anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>The loss of any of our significant customers could affect our financial health.</B>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our 10 largest customers generated approximately 21.8% and 23.8% of our sales for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We cannot guarantee that we will maintain or
improve our relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply these customers
at historical levels. Due to the current housing downturn, many of our homebuilder customers have
substantially reduced construction activity. Some homebuilder customers have exited or severely
curtailed building activity in certain of our markets. This trend is likely to continue until there
is a housing recovery in our markets. Continuation of the current housing downturn could have a
significant adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

purchase some of the products that we currently sell directly from manufacturers, (2)&nbsp;elect to
establish their own building products manufacturing and distribution facilities, or (3)&nbsp;give
advantages to manufacturing or distribution intermediaries in which they have an economic stake. In
addition, continued consolidation among production homebuilders could also result in a loss of some
of our present customers to our competitors. The loss of one or more of our significant customers
or deterioration in our relations with any of them could significantly affect our financial
condition, operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, our customers are not required to
purchase any minimum amount of products from us. The contracts into which we have entered with most
of our professional customers typically provide that we supply particular products or services for
a certain period of time when and if ordered by the customer. Should our customers purchase our

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building products supply industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We face
significant competition from local and regional building materials chains, as well as from
privately-owned single site enterprises. Any of these competitors may (1)&nbsp;foresee the course of
market development more accurately than we do, (2)&nbsp;develop products that are superior to our
products, (3)&nbsp;have the ability to produce or supply similar products at a lower cost, (4)&nbsp;develop
stronger relationships with local homebuilders, (5)&nbsp;adapt more quickly to new technologies or
evolving customer requirements than we do, or (6)&nbsp;have access to financing on more favorable terms
than we can obtain in the market. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with
them. In addition, home center retailers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts
on retail consumers and small contractors, may in the future intensify their marketing efforts to
professional homebuilders. Furthermore, certain product manufacturers sell and distribute their
products directly to production homebuilders. The volume of such direct sales could increase in the
future. Additionally, manufacturers of products distributed by us may elect to sell and distribute
directly to homebuilders in the future or enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with other
distributors. Consolidation of production homebuilders may result in increased competition for
their business. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our operating costs or product prices at a
level sufficiently low enough for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively, our
financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>We are subject to competitive pricing pressure from our customers.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Production homebuilders historically have exerted significant pressure on their outside
suppliers to keep prices low because of their market share and their ability to leverage such
market share in the highly fragmented building products supply industry. The current housing
industry downturn has resulted in significantly increased pricing pressures from production
homebuilders and other customers. These pricing pressures significantly adversely affected our
operating results and cash flows during 2009 and 2010. In addition, continued consolidation among
production homebuilders, and changes in production homebuilders&#146; purchasing policies or payment
practices, could result in additional pricing pressure. In addition, as a result of the housing
downturn, several of our homebuilder customers have defaulted on amounts owed to us or their
payable days have become extended as a result of their financial condition, however, our accounts receivable days decreased in 2010 compared to 2009. Such payment failures
or delays may significantly adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash
flows.

50% of our outstanding common stock. Five of our ten directors hold positions with affiliates of
either JLL or Warburg Pincus. Accordingly, JLL and Warburg Pincus have significant influence over
our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the
election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our
company or its assets. This concentrated ownership position limits other stockholders&#146; ability to
influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that some of our stockholders do
not view as beneficial. Additionally, JLL and Warburg Pincus are in the business of making
investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that
compete directly or indirectly with us. These entities may also pursue, for their own accounts,
acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those
acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Further, certain provisions of our amended

managerial, operational, sales, and marketing personnel. We face significant competition for these
types of employees in our industry and from other industries. We may be unsuccessful in attracting
and retaining the personnel we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully. In
addition, key personnel may leave us and compete against us. Our success also depends to a
significant extent on the continued service of our senior management team. We may be unsuccessful
in replacing key managers who either quit or retire. The loss of any member of our senior
management team or other experienced, senior employees could impair our ability to execute our
business plan, cause us to lose customers and reduce our net sales, or lead to employee morale
problems and/or the loss of other key employees. In any such event, our financial condition,
operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected.

proceedings.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are involved in product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we
manufacture and distribute that, if adversely determined, could adversely affect our financial
condition, operating results, and cash flows. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to
provide us with many of the products we sell and distribute. Because we do not have direct control
over the quality of such products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers, we are
exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products. In addition, we are exposed to potential
claims arising from the conduct of homebuilders and their subcontractors, for which we may be
contractually liable. Although we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate
insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection
against potential liabilities. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert
the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate
outcome. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our
products and our company. In addition, we are involved on an ongoing basis in other types of legal
proceedings. We cannot assure you that any current or future claims will not adversely affect our
financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.

manufacturers could affect our financial health.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability
to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our products
are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities. However, the loss of, or a
substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key
supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash
flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are
generally terminable by either party on limited notice. Failure by our suppliers to continue to
supply us with products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could put pressure on our
operating margins or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results,
and cash flows. Short-term changes in the cost of these materials, some of which are subject to
significant fluctuations, are sometimes, but not always passed on to our customers. Our delayed
ability to pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our financial

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have historically experienced, and in the future will continue to experience, variability
in revenues and earnings on a quarterly basis. The factors expected to contribute to this
variability include, among others: (1)&nbsp;the volatility of prices of lumber, wood products and other
building products, (2)&nbsp;the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry, (3)&nbsp;general economic
conditions in the various local markets in which we compete, (4)&nbsp;the pricing policies of our
competitors, (5)&nbsp;the production schedules of our customers, and (6)&nbsp;the effects of the weather.
These factors, among others, make it difficult to project our operating results on a consistent

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of
our major business functions. Our primary ERP system, which we use for operations representing
approximately 98% of our sales, is a proprietary system that has been highly customized by our
computer programmers. Our centralized financial reporting system currently draws data from our ERP
systems. We rely upon such information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to
fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis, and to coordinate our sales activities across all
of our products and services. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for
any prolonged time period (arising from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected
increases in our volume of business, outages, or delays in our service) could result in delays in
receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and adversely affect our customer
service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural or man-made
events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar disruptions affecting
the global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or costs will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>We may be adversely affected by any natural or man-made disruptions to our distribution and
manufacturing facilities.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently maintain a broad network of distribution and manufacturing facilities throughout
the southern and eastern U.S. Any serious disruption to our facilities resulting from fire,
earthquake, weather-related events, an act of terrorism, or any other cause could damage a
significant portion of our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our
products to customers. Moreover, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times
associated with distributing our products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to
reopen or replace a damaged facility. In addition, any shortages of fuel or significant fuel cost
increases could seriously disrupt our ability to distribute products to our customers. If any of
these events were to occur, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be
materially adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>We may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes increasing sales of
our prefabricated components and other value-added products, pursuing strategic acquisitions and

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long-term strategy depends in part on growing our sales of prefabricated components and
other value-added products and increasing our market share. If any of these initiatives are not
successful, or require extensive investment, our growth may be limited, and we may be unable to
achieve or maintain expected levels of growth and profitability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long-term business plan also provides for continued growth through strategic acquisitions
and organic growth through the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing
facilities. Failure to identify and acquire suitable acquisition candidates on appropriate terms
could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy. Moreover, a significant change in our
business, the economy, or the housing market, an unexpected decrease in our cash flow for any
reason, or the requirements of our senior secured revolving credit facility or the indenture
governing our 2016 notes, could result in an inability to obtain the capital required to effect new
acquisitions or expansions of existing facilities. Our failure to make successful acquisitions or
to build or expand facilities, including manufacturing facilities, produce saleable product, or
meet customer demand in a timely manner could result in damage to or loss of customer
relationships, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash
flows. In addition, although we have been successful in the past in integrating 27 acquisitions, we
may not be able to integrate the operations of future acquired businesses with our own in an
efficient and cost-effective manner or without significant disruption to our existing operations.
Acquisitions, moreover, involve significant risks and uncertainties, including uncertainties as to
the future financial performance of the acquired business, difficulties integrating acquired
personnel and corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees, customers
or suppliers, difficulties in integrating different computer and accounting systems, exposure to
unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, and the diversion of management attention and
resources from existing operations. We may be unable to successfully complete potential
acquisitions due to multiple factors, such as issues related to regulatory review of the proposed
transactions. We may also be required to incur additional debt in order to consummate acquisitions
in the future, which debt may be substantial and may limit our flexibility in using our cash flow
from operations. Our failure to integrate future acquired businesses effectively or to manage other
consequences of our acquisitions, including increased indebtedness, could prevent us from remaining
competitive and, ultimately, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and
cash flows.

policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of
factors, including restrictions in our debt instruments, as well as our future earnings, capital
requirements, financial condition, prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem
relevant. The terms of our $150&nbsp;million senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 2016
notes currently restrict our ability to pay dividends. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of

    <TD><I>Homebuilding Industry. </I>Our business is driven primarily by the residential new
construction market, which is in turn dependent upon a number of factors, including
interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates, foreclosure rates, and the health of
the economy and mortgage markets. Over the past few years, many homebuilders significantly
decreased their starts because of lower demand and an excess of home inventory. Due to the
decline in housing starts and increased competition for homebuilder business, we have and
will continue to experience increased pressure on our margins. Housing starts remain at
historically low levels but industry forecasters expect to see some improvement in 2011. We
also still believe there are several meaningful trends that indicate U.S. housing demand
will likely recover in the long term and that the current downturn in the housing industry
is likely a trough in the cyclical nature of the residential construction industry. These
trends include relatively low interest rates, the aging of housing stock, and normal
population growth due to birthrate exceeding death rate.</TD>

    <TD><I>Targeting Large Production Homebuilders. </I>In recent years, the homebuilding industry has
undergone significant consolidation, with the larger homebuilders substantially increasing
their market share. We expect that trend to accelerate during this housing correction due
to the better liquidity positions of the larger homebuilders relative to the smaller, less
capitalized homebuilders. Our focus is on maintaining relationships and market share with
these customers while balancing the competitive pressures we are facing in our markets with
certain profitability expectations. Our sales to the &#147;Builder 100,&#148; the country&#146;s largest
100 homebuilders, increased 13.4% during 2010, which is more than the overall increase in
housing

    <TD><I>Use of Prefabricated Components. </I>Prior to the current housing downturn, homebuilders
were increasingly using prefabricated components in order to realize increased efficiency
and improved quality. Shortening cycle time from start to completion was a key imperative
of the homebuilders during periods of strong consumer demand. With the current housing
downturn, that trend has decelerated as cycle time has less relevance. Customers who
traditionally used prefabricated components, for the most part, still do. However, the
conversion of customers to this product offering has slowed. We expect this trend to
continue at least for the duration of this downturn. In response, we have reduced our
manufacturing capacity and delayed plans to open new facilities.</TD>

    <TD><I>Economic Conditions. </I>Economic changes both nationally and locally in our markets impact
our financial performance. The building products supply industry is highly dependent upon
new home construction and subject to cyclical market changes. Our operations are subject to
fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national and local economic
conditions, labor costs, competition, government regulation, trade policies and other
factors that affect the homebuilding industry such as demographic trends, interest rates,
single-family housing starts, employment levels, consumer confidence, and the availability
of credit to homebuilders, contractors, and homeowners. During 2007, the mortgage markets
experienced substantial disruption due to increased defaults, primarily as a result of
credit quality deterioration. The disruption has continued and
resulted in a stricter regulatory environment and reduced availability of mortgages for potential
homebuyers due to an illiquid credit market and tighter standards to qualify for mortgages.
Mortgage financing and commercial credit for smaller homebuilders continue to be severely
constrained. As the housing industry is dependent upon the economy and employment levels
as well as potential homebuyers&#146; access to mortgage financing and homebuilders&#146; access to
commercial credit, it is likely that the housing industry will not recover until conditions
in the economy and the credit markets substantially improve and unemployment rates decline.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>CURRENT OPERATING CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenging conditions in the homebuilding industry persisted throughout 2010, but it was the
first time in the past five years that the housing industry experienced an increase in starts, as
actual single-family housing starts in the U.S. increased 5.9%, from 445,000 in 2009 to 471,100 in
2010. Despite this increase, the housing industry continued to struggle due to the limited
availability of credit to smaller homebuilders and potential homebuyers, a slow economic recovery,
and high unemployment rates, among other factors. These difficult conditions and the extreme
volatility in the commodity markets negatively impacted our 2010 results. Our strategy to mitigate
these difficult conditions principally consisted of generating new business, implementing cost
containment programs which included reducing physical capacity and adjusting staffing levels,
managing credit tightly and, most importantly, conserving cash. During 2010, we closed or idled
eight locations and lowered our average full time equivalent headcount, excluding discontinued
operations, by an additional 2.4%, after decreasing it by approximately 33.0% from 2008 to 2009.
The reductions in payroll costs coupled with other cost reductions allowed us to reduce our
selling, general and administrative expenses by 3.6% from 2009. Our bad debt expense in 2010
decreased $1.9&nbsp;million from 2009 despite the difficult economic conditions our customers faced.
Because of these measures and others, we ended the year with $103.2&nbsp;million in cash. We believe
these efforts will not only benefit us in the short-term but will allow us to be a more efficient
organization in the long-term.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing conditions are expected to stabilize somewhat and potentially show a slight
improvement in 2011. In fact, the NAHB is forecasting 555,000 single-family housing starts for
2011, a 17.8% increase from 2010 actual starts. We believe our strategy remains relevant in these
conditions and allows us to focus on conserving liquidity while maintaining a viable operating
platform. We have aggressively but prudently cut costs during this downturn. In addition, we
believe we can continue to partially offset the low level of housing starts by expanding our
presence in the light commercial and multi-family segments, as well as increasing penetration with
our top customers. Finally, we will continue to focus on working capital, diligently control
credit to our customers and also work with our vendors to improve our payment terms and pricing on
our products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still believe that the long-term outlook for the housing industry is positive due to growth
in the underlying demographics. At this point, it is unclear if housing activity has hit bottom,
but we believe our market leadership, financial strength and operating efficiencies afford us the
ability to manage through the downturn. We will continue to work diligently to achieve the
appropriate balance of short-term cost reductions while maintaining the expertise to grow the
business when market conditions improve. We want to create long-term shareholder value and avoid
taking steps that will limit our ability to compete.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition and level of working capital typically change during periods of increasing
sales as we carry more inventory and receivables. Working capital levels typically increase in the
second and third quarters of the year due to higher sales during the peak residential construction
season. These increases have in the past resulted in negative operating cash flows during this peak
season, which historically have been financed through available cash. Collection of receivables and
reduction in inventory levels following the peak building and construction season have in the past
helped to partially offset this negative cash flow. We have also from time to time utilized our
credit facility to cover working capital needs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Valuation Allowance</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We evaluate our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation
allowance is required. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our
determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. In light of the continued downturn in the housing market and the
uncertainty as to its length and magnitude and the additional asset impairments recorded during
2008, we were in a three-year cumulative loss position. Cumulative losses in recent years represent
significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable, and also
usually preclude relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of
deferred tax assets. Therefore, during 2008, we recorded a valuation allowance totaling $41.2
million against primarily all of our net deferred tax assets, of which $31.6&nbsp;million related to our
continuing operations, $3.0&nbsp;million related to other comprehensive (loss)&nbsp;income and $6.6&nbsp;million
related to our discontinued operations. We excluded the deferred tax liabilities related to certain
indefinite lived intangibles when calculating the amount of valuation allowance needed as these
liabilities cannot be considered as a source of income when determining the realizability of the
net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded as a reduction to our 2008 income tax
benefit. We recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately $35.4&nbsp;million and $3.9
million related to our continuing operations in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deferred tax assets for which there is no valuation allowance relate to amounts that can
be realized through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences or through the
generation of sufficient taxable income. To the extent we generate sufficient taxable income in the
future to fully utilize the tax benefits of the net deferred tax assets on which a valuation
allowance was recorded, our effective tax rate may decrease as the valuation allowance is reversed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>2010 Compared with 2009</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2010 we experienced extreme volatility in the commodity markets, especially during the
first half of 2010, resulting in a 28.1% increase in average market prices on our lumber and lumber sheet goods
when compared to 2009. Single-family housing starts in our markets increased approximately 6.5%, while
single-family units under construction in our markets decreased approximately 6.2% from 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Sales. </I>Sales for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 were $700.3&nbsp;million, a 3.3% increase from
sales of $677.9&nbsp;million for 2009. The increase in our sales was primarily due to the effects of
commodity inflation partially resulting from demand created by the federal tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which
expired in the first half of 2010. As the housing industry continued to struggle during 2010, we
maintained our tightened credit policies in order to avoid taking any unnecessary credit risks.
While these tighter credit standards may reduce our growth potential, they are designed to limit
our exposure to large write-offs of uncollectible receivable balances in the future. We do,
however, believe that we were able to slightly increase share with our Builder 100 customers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales increase was due primarily to an increase in price, partially offset by a slight
decrease in volume. For the lumber and lumber sheet goods category, price accounted for
approximately 95% of our sales increase in this product category while unit volume accounted for 5%
of the increase. This equates to $35.1&nbsp;million and $1.7&nbsp;million in sales increases due to price
and volume, respectively, within this product category.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales mix shifted away from other building products and services during the year. This
category, which includes labor revenue on installed services, declined as a percentage of sales
largely due to 28% commodity inflation during the year and a decrease in multi-family construction,
which was down approximately 53%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Gross Margin. </I>Gross margin decreased $10.7&nbsp;million to $131.8&nbsp;million. Our gross margin
percentage decreased from 21.0% in 2009 to 18.8% in 2010, a 2.2&nbsp;percentage point decline. Our gross
margin percentage decreased by 2.6&nbsp;percentage points due to price, due to the negative impact
of the commodity price volatility seen during the first half of 2010, along with very competitive
pricing conditions. Our gross margin percentage increased 0.3&nbsp;percentage points due to volume (as
a result of fixed costs within cost of goods sold) and 0.1&nbsp;percentage points due to a shift in
sales mix. If difficult economic conditions persist, we could continue to see additional pressure
on our gross margin.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. </I>Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased $7.3&nbsp;million, or 3.6%. Our office general and administrative expense decreased $5.3
million, primarily due to a $1.0&nbsp;million decrease in depreciation expense, a $1.2&nbsp;million
litigation settlement we received in 2010, as well as $3.2&nbsp;million of recapitalization costs we
incurred in 2009. Additionally, bad debt expense decreased $1.9&nbsp;million due to tightened credit
standards,
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 29.7% in
2009 to 27.7% in 2010. Our office general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales
decreased 0.9%, delivery costs decreased by 0.3%, occupancy decreased by 0.3% due to the fixed
nature of the category and bad debt expense decreased by 0.3%. We will continue to monitor our
operating cost structure closely and make adjustments as necessary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interest Expense, net. </I>Interest expense was $31.7&nbsp;million in 2010, an increase of $4.6
million. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates on our 2016 notes issued in
January&nbsp;2010, combined with the write-off of $1.6&nbsp;million of unamortized debt issuance costs
related to long-term debt repaid, $2.5&nbsp;million of costs incurred related to our recapitalization
transaction, and the write-off of $0.6&nbsp;million in debt issuance costs related to the reduction of
our revolving credit facility from $250&nbsp;million to $150&nbsp;million in 2010. These increases were
partially offset by lower average debt balances and a write-off of $1.2&nbsp;million in debt issue costs
and $1.6&nbsp;million of expense related to the settlement of one of our swaps in 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. </I>We recorded an income tax benefit of $1.1&nbsp;million during 2010
compared to a benefit of $30.8&nbsp;million during 2009. Our benefit was reduced by an after tax,
non-cash valuation allowance of $35.4&nbsp;million and $3.9&nbsp;million related to our net deferred tax
assets for 2010 and 2009, respectively. In 2009, we recognized a $2.1&nbsp;million income tax benefit
in continuing operations related to losses generated by our discontinued operations due to recently
enacted tax legislation that allowed for an extended carry-back of net operating losses generated
in 2009. Excluding the valuation allowance, our effective tax rate would have been 38.3&nbsp;percent for
2010. Excluding the valuation allowance and the impact of the change in tax law for 2009, our
effective tax rate would have been 37.2&nbsp;percent for 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Discontinued Operations, net. </I>Loss from discontinued operations was $1.2&nbsp;million in 2010
compared to $5.0&nbsp;million in 2009. In 2010, we recognized $1.1&nbsp;million in expense related to future
minimum lease obligations on closed facilities and revisions to sub-rental income estimates. In
2009, we recognized $2.4&nbsp;million in expense related to future minimum lease obligations on closed
facilities and employee severance. We also reduced our expense in 2009 by $1.8&nbsp;million due to a
negotiated lease termination. The

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macroeconomic factors continued to decline sharply in 2009 as both housing starts and
commodity lumber and lumber sheet goods prices were down year-over-year. Single-family housing
starts in our markets decreased approximately 28.3% while market prices for lumber and lumber sheet
goods were on average approximately 10.9% lower than 2008. Single-family units under construction
in our markets decreased approximately 37.7% from 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Sales. </I>Sales for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 were $677.9&nbsp;million, a 31.7% decrease from
sales of $992.0&nbsp;million for 2008. The decline in our sales was primarily due to the decline in
single family housing starts in our markets. During 2009, we further tightened our credit policies.
As the housing industry continued to decline, it became even more important for us to extend credit
prudently in order to avoid taking any unnecessary credit risks. This also contributed to our sales
decline. Although these tighter credit standards reduce our growth potential, they also limit our
exposure to large write-offs of uncollectible receivable balances in the future. Our installed
product sales were down less than the overall decline in single-family units under construction in
our markets as we continued to expand into the multi-family and light commercial market.
Additionally, we believe that we were able to slightly increase share with our Builder 100
customers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have felt the negative effect of decreased housing starts across all our product categories
primarily due to volume declines. For the lumber &#038; lumber sheet goods category, our unit volume
accounted for 84% of our sales decline in this product category while our prices accounted for 16%
of the decline. This equates to $62.0&nbsp;million and $12.1&nbsp;million in sales declines due to volume and
price, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales mix continued to shift toward other building products and services during the year.
This category grew as a percentage of sales due to expansion of our installation services in the
multi-family and light commercial market. We believe our installation business and our value-added
products and services give us a competitive advantage helping us to attract new business during the
down cycle.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Gross Margin. </I>Gross margin decreased $73.1&nbsp;million to $142.4&nbsp;million. The gross margin
percentage decreased from 21.7% in 2008 to 21.0% in 2009, a 0.7&nbsp;percentage point decline. Our gross
margin percentage decreased 0.6&nbsp;percentage points due to volume (as a result of fixed costs within
cost of goods sold) and 0.3&nbsp;percentage points due to a shift in sales mix toward installed product
sales, which carry a lower gross margin percentage. Our gross margin percentage increased by 0.2
percentage points due to price. We experienced margin compression across most product categories
due to competition and lower sales volumes against fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities. If
economic conditions continue to deteriorate, we could see further margin compression.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. </I>Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased $78.6&nbsp;million, or 28.1%. Average full-time equivalent employee headcount, excluding
discontinued operations, decreased 33.0% compared to 2008, while our salaries and benefits,
excluding stock compensation, decreased $45.1&nbsp;million, or 28.8%, compared to a 28.9% decline in
sales volume. We will continue to consider in-market consolidations and facility closures based on
specific market conditions. Additionally, delivery expenses decreased $13.9&nbsp;million, stock
compensation expense decreased $5.6&nbsp;million, our office general and administrative expense
decreased $9.0&nbsp;million, and occupancy expenses decreased $3.7&nbsp;million from 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 28.2% in
2008 to 29.7% in 2009. Salaries and benefit expense as a percentage of sales increased 0.7%,
occupancy by 0.5% due to the fixed nature of the category, and delivery costs

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">by 0.4%. Stock compensation expense as a percentage of sales decreased 0.5%. We continue to
monitor our operating cost structure closely and make adjustments as necessary.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Asset Impairments. </I>Asset impairments was $0.5&nbsp;million in 2009 compared to $46.9&nbsp;million in
2008. In 2009, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $0.5&nbsp;million related to land we have held
for sale. During 2008, the continued decline in the macroeconomic factors that drive our business
and the unfavorable economic factors that existed caused us to revise our expectations and assess
the recoverability of our long-lived assets. Based upon the results of our assessments, we
determined the carrying amounts of certain assets exceeded their estimated fair values. We
recorded goodwill impairment charges of $39.9&nbsp;million related to our Florida reporting unit and
recorded other asset impairment charges of $7.0&nbsp;million, which consisted of $4.4&nbsp;million of other
intangible assets, $2.2&nbsp;million of fixed assets and $0.4&nbsp;million related to land held for sale.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interest Expense, net. </I>Interest expense was $27.0&nbsp;million in 2009, an increase of $1.4
million. The increase was primarily due to the write-off in 2009 of $1.2&nbsp;million in debt issue
costs related to the reduction of our revolving credit facility from $350&nbsp;million to $250&nbsp;million
in 2009 and $1.6&nbsp;million in expense recorded related to the settlement of one of our swaps. These
increases were partially offset by lower average interest rates in 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Income Tax (Benefit) Expense. </I>We recorded an income tax benefit of $30.8&nbsp;million during 2009
compared to a tax benefit of $17.7&nbsp;million during 2008. Our benefit was reduced by an after tax,
non-cash valuation allowance of $3.9&nbsp;million and $31.6&nbsp;million related to our net deferred tax
assets for 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, we recognized a $2.1&nbsp;million income tax benefit
in continuing operations related to losses generated by our discontinued operations due to recently
enacted tax legislation that allowed for an extended carry-back of net operating losses generated
in 2009. Excluding the valuation allowance and the impact of this change in tax law for 2009, as
well as the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment for 2008, our effective tax rate
would have been 37.2&nbsp;percent and 38.0&nbsp;percent for 2009 and 2008, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Discontinued Operations, net. </I>Loss from discontinued operations was $5.0&nbsp;million in 2009
compared to $18.9&nbsp;million in 2008. In 2008, we exited the New Jersey market and closed two
facilities in Ohio. We recognized $2.4&nbsp;million and $7.4&nbsp;million in expense related to future
minimum lease obligations on closed facilities and employee severance in 2009 and 2008,
respectively. We also reduced our expense in 2009 by $1.8&nbsp;million due to a negotiated lease
termination. In 2008, we also recorded a $4.0&nbsp;million goodwill impairment charge related to our
Ohio operations. The remaining loss from discontinued operations in 2009 and 2008 was primarily
related to operating losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs and operating expenses,
meet required interest and principal payments, and fund capital expenditures. In the past, our
capital resources have primarily consisted of cash flows from operations and borrowings under our
credit facility. Additionally in January&nbsp;2010, we completed a rights offering and debt exchange
which reduced our indebtedness by $130.0&nbsp;million, extended the maturity of $139.7&nbsp;million of
indebtedness until 2016, and provided us with net proceeds of approximately $65&nbsp;million, after
paying for expenses related to the transaction (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements
included in Item&nbsp;8 of this annual report on Form 10-K). The homebuilding industry, and therefore
our industry, has been in a severe and significant downturn which began almost five years ago. We expect the
housing industry to stabilize and potentially show a slight improvement in 2011. Beyond 2011, it is
difficult for us to predict what will happen as our industry is dependent on a number of factors,
including national economic conditions, employment levels, the availability of credit for
homebuilders and potential home buyers, the level of foreclosures, existing home inventory, and
interest rates. With the sustained downturn in the housing industry, our operations are no longer
providing positive cash flows, and we are not expecting our cash flows from operations to be
positive in the near term.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our borrowing base consists of trade accounts receivable, inventory and fixed assets, which
meet specific criteria contained within the credit agreement, minus agent specified reserves. Our
borrowing base availability, net of the minimum liquidity requirement, at December&nbsp;31, 2010 was
$22.6&nbsp;million. Excess availability is the sum of borrowing base plus qualified cash, defined as
cash on deposit with the agent subject to a control agreement, minus outstanding borrowings and
letters of credit. This amount must equal or exceed a specified minimum liquidity requirement (See
Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item&nbsp;8 of this annual report on Form
10-K), at the monthly reporting dates or we are required to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1
to 1, which we currently would not meet.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further declines in our borrowing base, if any, could compel us to either repay outstanding
borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility or increase our cash on deposit with
the agent in order to meet the excess availability requirement. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had $103.2
million of unencumbered cash that can be used to either repay the $35.9&nbsp;million currently funded
under the facility, which consists of $20.0&nbsp;million of outstanding borrowings and $15.9&nbsp;million of
letters of credit, or support any shortfall in the net borrowing base availability. At December&nbsp;31,
2010, we were not in violation of any covenants or restrictions imposed by any of our debt
agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had total liquidity of $125.8&nbsp;million which consisted of $103.2
million of cash on hand and $22.6&nbsp;million of net borrowing base availability. We believe our
liquidity is sufficient to meet our needs in 2011. We expect our cash usage for 2011 will be in
the range of $55-$65&nbsp;million and to end the year with total liquidity of approximately $65-$70
million. This forecast is based on 520,000 single-family housing starts for 2011, market prices
for commodity products remaining relatively stable for the year, anticipated gross margin
improvement in the range of 150 basis points over 2010, an operating expense structure that is
consistent with current levels, consistent advance rates under our credit facility year-over-year,
and capital expenditures of $3-$5&nbsp;million. We considered various scenarios when evaluating our
liquidity needs for 2011, including housing starts consistent with 2010. Even at these depressed
levels, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to meet our 2011 needs. We do not expect working
capital or our credit facility to be a significant source of funds for the next twelve months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have set an action plan designed to provide us with sufficient liquidity for 2011. In the
event that housing starts for 2011 are higher or lower than expected, or other assumptions prove to
be inaccurate, our forecasted cash usage and liquidity levels may change.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Alternatives to help supplement our liquidity position could include, but are not limited to,
idling or permanently closing additional facilities, adjusting our headcount in response to current
business conditions, attempts to renegotiate leases, and divesting of non-core businesses. There
are no assurances that these steps will prove successful if housing activity does not improve.
Should the current industry conditions continue or further deteriorate beyond 2011, we may be
required to raise additional funds through the sale of common stock or debt in the public capital
markets or in privately negotiated transactions. There can be no assurance that any of these
financing options would be available on favorable terms, if at all. Should the credit markets
improve and favorable financing options become available to us prior to that time, we may take
advantage of such options in order to enhance our liquidity.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of the housing downturn, a primary focus has been on protecting our
liquidity. Our action plan, which consists of generating new business, reducing physical capacity,
adjusting staffing levels, implementing cost containment programs, managing credit tightly, and
most importantly, conserving cash has allowed us to mitigate the effects of the difficult industry
conditions. We will continue to execute this strategy as long as these conditions persist.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash used in operating activities increased $39.0&nbsp;million in 2010 compared to 2009. We
received federal income tax refunds related to the carry-back of losses of approximately $33.8
million and $31.8&nbsp;million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Excluding the federal income tax refund
received in 2010, our cash used in operations for 2010 was approximately $75.5&nbsp;million. Of this cash used in
2010, approximately $5.5&nbsp;million related to an increase in working capital, primarily related to
increased inventory purchases towards the end of the year in an attempt to protect our first
quarter 2011 pricing commitments. The remaining cash used was to fund our operating losses and cash
interest payments. Our asset utilization improved as our accounts receivable days decreased in 2010
compared to 2009 as we continued reducing our overall delinquency rate and increased the rate of
our overall receivable collections. Our inventory turns remained flat year-over-year and our
accounts payable days increased slightly from 2009. We continue our focus on diligently managing
working capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash used in operating activities decreased $26.1&nbsp;million in 2009 compared to 2008. In 2009,
we received a federal income tax refund of approximately $31.8&nbsp;million related to the carry-back of
losses generated in 2008. In 2008, we received federal income tax refunds of $14.0&nbsp;million.
Excluding these federal income tax refunds, our cash used in operations for 2009 actually decreased
$8.2&nbsp;million. This decrease in cash used for operations was primarily due to changes in working
capital. We continued to aggressively manage working capital. We saw a decrease in the number of
days outstanding for our accounts receivable as we were successful in collecting older accounts and
reducing our overall delinquency rate. We also experienced an increase in our inventory turns. Our
average accounts payable days decreased slightly, as we continued to work with our vendors on
extending our payment terms.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash used for investing activities increased by $8.2&nbsp;million in 2010 compared to 2009. The
increase was primarily due to a $6.9&nbsp;million increase in capital expenditures related to buyouts of
expiring vehicle and equipment leases. In addition, proceeds from the sale of assets decreased
$1.4&nbsp;million as we actively sold off excess equipment in the prior year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash used for investing activities decreased $2.2&nbsp;million in 2009 compared to 2008. The
decrease was primarily due to a $6.1&nbsp;million decrease in capital expenditures, as we attempted to
conserve capital in the current operating environment. Partially offsetting our decreased capital
expenditures was a decrease of $3.2&nbsp;million of proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment
primarily due to the sale of real estate from closed facilities in 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net cash provided by financing activities was $69.2&nbsp;million in 2010 compared to net cash used
in financing activities of $19.9&nbsp;million in 2009. The net proceeds received upon completion of our
rights offering and debt exchange in the first quarter of 2010 was the primary source of the cash
provided in 2010. The primary use of cash in 2009 was $20.0&nbsp;million of payments under our
revolving credit facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net cash used in financing activities was $19.9&nbsp;million in 2009 compared to net cash provided

base, is derived primarily from a percentage of  our eligible accounts receivable and inventory,
as defined by the agreement. During the first quarter of 2009, we reduced our borrowing capacity
under the Facility from $350&nbsp;million to $250&nbsp;million as allowed by the revolving credit facility
agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we amended the Facility to further reduce our
borrowing capacity from $250&nbsp;million to $150&nbsp;million. Our available borrowing capacity at December
31, 2010 was not affected by these reductions as eligible accounts receivable and inventory
balances, which are used to calculate the available borrowing capacity, do not support borrowings
in excess of $150&nbsp;million. We do not anticipate that our borrowing base will support borrowings in
excess of $150&nbsp;million at any point during the remaining life of the credit facility. These
reductions allowed us to reduce our interest expense related to commitment fees. We expensed $0.6
million and $1.2&nbsp;million related to unamortized debt issuance costs as part of these reductions in
the Facility in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The amendment also reduced our minimum liquidity
requirement, which was previously $35.0&nbsp;million and which is now determined on a sliding scale
based on our ninety-day average gross availability, as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest rates under the Facility are based on a base rate plus an applicable margin. The base
rate is the larger of the rate determined by the administrative agent (typically their prime rate)
or the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half percent, as each term is defined by the agreement. A
variable commitment fee, currently 0.425%, is charged on the unused amount of the revolver and is
based on our most recent previous quarterly average excess availability. We had $20.0&nbsp;million in
outstanding borrowings under the Facility at December&nbsp;31, 2010. The weighted average interest rate
on the borrowings outstanding under the Facility was 3.75% at December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, primarily accounts receivable and
inventory, and are guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries. Our net borrowing
availability in excess of the required minimum liquidity covenant at December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $22.6
million. The Facility has certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to
the payment of dividends, incurrence of indebtedness, and asset sales. The Facility also has a
fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1 that is triggered if our available borrowing capacity, as
determined under the borrowing base formula, is less than a minimum liquidity requirement. At
December&nbsp;31, 2010, the minimum liquidity requirement was $10.0&nbsp;million. The calculation also
allows cash on deposit with the agent to be included as eligible borrowing base. Based on our 2011
forecast, while we will not meet the fixed charge coverage ratio, we anticipate that we will not
fall below the minimum liquidity covenant in 2011 including the use of cash on deposit with the
agent; therefore, we will not trigger the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement. The fixed
charge coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of earnings before interest expenses, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization expenses minus capital expenditures, cash taxes paid, dividends,
distributions and share repurchases or redemptions to the sum of scheduled principal payments and
interest expense on a trailing twelve month basis from the trigger date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had $275.0&nbsp;million outstanding in aggregate principal amount of
2012 notes. Interest accrues on the 2012 notes at a rate of LIBOR plus 4.25% and is payable
quarterly in arrears. The weighted-average interest rate at December&nbsp;31, 2010 for the 2012 notes
was 4.5%. The LIBOR rate is reset at the beginning of each quarterly period. At any time, we can
redeem some or all of the notes at par. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the
indenture), we may be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of
the principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;21, 2010, we completed a common stock rights offering and debt exchange for our
2012 notes. As part of these transactions, we raised $180.1&nbsp;million of new equity capital through
the issuance of 51,459,184 shares of common stock in the rights offering at a subscription price of
$3.50 per share. We used $105.1&nbsp;million of the proceeds from the rights offering to repurchase a
portion of the 2012 notes in the debt exchange. We used a portion of the remaining $75.0&nbsp;million of
proceeds to pay expenses of the rights offering and the debt exchange and the remainder is being
used for general corporate purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $139.7&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of new 2016 notes mature on February&nbsp;15,
2016. Interest accrues on the 2016 notes at a rate of 3-month LIBOR (subject to a 3.0% floor) plus
10.0%. LIBOR is reset at the beginning of each quarterly period. The weighted-average interest rate
at December&nbsp;31, 2010 for the 2016 notes was 13.0%. Interest on the floating rate notes is payable
quarterly in arrears. At any time we can redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price
equal to par plus a specified premium that declines ratably to par. In the event of a change in
control, we may be required to offer to purchase the 2016 notes at a purchase price equal to 101%
of the principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our  subsidiaries and
collateralized by a pledge of common stock of certain of our subsidiaries and by a second priority
lien on substantially all tangible and intangible property and interests in property and proceeds
thereof now owned or hereafter acquired by us and substantially all of our subsidiaries. All of the
subsidiaries are wholly-owned and domiciled in the United States. The parent company has no
independent assets or operations, and the guarantees are full and unconditional. The indenture
covering the notes contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the
payment of dividends, incurrence of indebtedness, repurchase of common stock or other
distributions, asset sales and investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of 2008, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with
notional amounts of $100.0&nbsp;million, $50.0&nbsp;million and $50.0&nbsp;million. We entered into these interest
rate swaps in order to mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk that we were exposed to in the
normal course of business on our floating rate notes. The swap agreements, effective May&nbsp;15, 2008,
were for a term of three years. The interest rate swaps qualified as fully effective, cash-flow
hedging instruments. Therefore, all changes in fair value of the qualifying cash flow hedges were
reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the
same period in which the hedge transactions affected earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, certain conditions of the proposed recapitalization plan were met which
indicated that the transaction was considered probable of occurring. The recapitalization plan
reduced our outstanding floating rate notes to $145.0&nbsp;million causing a portion of the future cash
flows being hedged by our $200&nbsp;million swaps to be deemed probable of not occurring. As a result,
in December&nbsp;2009 we cancelled and settled our $50&nbsp;million swap with a fixed rate of 2.99% for $1.7
million. Primarily all of this payment was expensed and was included as a component of interest
expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.
Under the remaining $100&nbsp;million and $50&nbsp;million swap agreements, we are paying fixed rates of
3.25% and 3.17%, respectively, and receiving a variable rate at 90&nbsp;day LIBOR. In December&nbsp;2009, we
also de-designated the remaining $150&nbsp;million of our swaps. Amounts included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss for $5.0&nbsp;million of the remaining swaps were reclassed to expense in
2009 as the cash flows being hedged were considered probable of not occurring. Amounts included in
accumulated other comprehensive loss at December&nbsp;31, 2009 related to the remaining $145.0
million of swaps were frozen and are being amortized over the remaining terms of the swaps. Any
subsequent changes in the fair value of these swaps are recognized in interest expense, net, in the
consolidated statement of operations. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the fair value of the interest rate
swaps was a liability of $2.2&nbsp;million.

    <TD>We completed construction on a new multi-purpose facility during 2006.
Other long-term debt represents an unfunded lease obligation for this
facility. For accounting purposes, we are deemed the owner. As a
result, the building and the offsetting long-term lease obligation are
included on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of fixed
assets and other debt, respectively. The building is being depreciated
over its useful life, and the lease obligation is being amortized such
that there will be no gain or loss recorded if the lease is not
extended at the end of the term.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital expenditures vary depending on prevailing business factors, including current and
anticipated market conditions. Historically, capital expenditures have for the most part remained
at relatively low levels in comparison to the operating cash flows generated during the
corresponding periods. In order to buyout expiring equipment and vehicle leases, we increased our
capital expenditures to $9.0&nbsp;million in 2010. We expect our 2011 capital expenditures to be
approximately $3 to $5&nbsp;million primarily related to buyouts of additional expiring equipment and
vehicle leases and facility improvements that will be needed to support our operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>OTHER CASH OBLIGATIONS NOT REFLECTED IN THE BALANCE SHEET</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, commonly
referred to as GAAP, our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet. In addition to the
lease obligations included in the above table, we have residual value guarantees on certain
equipment leases. Under these leases we have the option of (1)&nbsp;purchasing the equipment at the end
of the lease term, (2)&nbsp;arranging for the sale of the equipment to a third party, or (3)&nbsp;returning
the equipment to the lessor to sell the equipment. If the sales proceeds in either case are less
than the residual value, then we are required to reimburse the lessor for the deficiency up to a
specified level as stated in each lease agreement. The guarantees under these leases for the
residual values of equipment at the end of the respective operating lease periods approximated $1.9
million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the
end of the lease term that is materially less than the value specified in the related operating
lease agreement or that we will purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term, we do not
believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these
guarantee arrangements. Accordingly, no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critical accounting policies are those that both are important to the accurate portrayal of a
company&#146;s financial condition and results, and require subjective or complex judgments, often as a
result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prepare financial statements that conform to GAAP, we make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes.
Certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements
and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have identified the following accounting policies that require us to make the most
subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and
results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Vendor Rebates. </I>Many of our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate
of a specified amount payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures, generally related
to the volume of purchases from our vendors. We account for these rebates as a reduction of the
prices of the vendor&#146;s products, which reduces inventory until we sell the product, at which time
these rebates reduce cost of sales. Throughout the year, we estimate the amount of rebates based
upon our historical level of purchases. We continually revise these estimates to reflect actual
purchase levels.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If market conditions were to change, vendors may change the terms of some or all of these
programs. Although these changes would not affect the amounts which we have recorded related to
product already purchased, it may impact our gross margins on products we sell or sales earned in
future periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Related Reserves. </I>We maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses due to the failure of our customers to make required payments. We
perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral.
However, as industry conditions have continued to decline, we have, in some cases, required
customers to collateralize their debt to us. Consistent with industry practices, we typically
require payment from most customers within 30&nbsp;days. As our business is seasonal in certain regions,
our customers&#146; businesses are also seasonal. Sales are lowest in the winter months, and our past
due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during
this time. Throughout the year, we record estimated reserves based upon our historical write-offs
of uncollectible accounts, taking into consideration certain factors, such as aging statistics and
trends, customer payment history, independent credit reports, and discussions with customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Periodically, we perform a specific analysis of all accounts past due and write off account
balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of
collection is remote. We charge these write-offs against our allowance for doubtful accounts. In
previous years, we experienced higher than normal past due account balances and as a result, our
allowance for doubtful accounts increased as a percentage of trade accounts receivable. In
response to these conditions, we tightened our credit standards, lowered credit limits to some of
our customers, and in some cases discontinued allowing credit or required collateral to support
outstanding receivable balances. As a result, our bad debt expense decreased approximately $1.9
million from 2009, which also resulted in a decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts. Any
future decline in the macroeconomic factors that affect the overall housing industry or our
specific customers&#146; business could cause us to revise our estimate of expected losses and increase
our allowance for doubtful accounts.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. </I>Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, are
reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset group is not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use
and eventual disposition of the asset group. Our long-lived assets and liabilities are grouped at
the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of
other groups of assets and liabilities. Our asset groups consist of geographical markets, which
are one level below our reporting units. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment
indicators is based on market and operational performance. Determining whether impairment has
occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash
flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows
will occur, their amount, and the asset&#146;s residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an
impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information
available.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use internal cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and independent
appraisals, as appropriate, to determine fair value. We derive the required cash flow estimates
from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount
rate. These cash flow estimates are over the remaining useful lives of the assets within each
market. Forecasted housing starts for each market are used to help estimate future revenue.
Historical trends are then used to project gross margins and operating expenses based upon various
revenue levels. If these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss
is recognized based on the fair value of the asset group. Due to the uncertainties associated with
these projections, actual results could differ from projected results, and further impairment of
long-lived assets could be recorded. Future non-cash impairment of long-lived assets would have
the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period, but would not impact
our current outstanding debt obligations or compliance with covenants contained in the related debt
agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recorded asset impairment charges of $0.8&nbsp;million, $0.5&nbsp;million, and $7.0&nbsp;million in 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Goodwill. </I>Goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire businesses over the
estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, less
liabilities assumed. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, our goodwill balance was $111.2&nbsp;million, representing
26.9% of our total assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or at any other time when
impairment indicators exist by comparing the estimated implied value of a reporting units&#146; goodwill
to its book value. Examples of such indicators that could cause us to test goodwill for impairment
between annual tests include a significant change in the business climate, unexpected competition,
significant deterioration in market share or a loss of key personnel. Our industry has been in a
significant and severe downturn that began in mid-2006. In this environment, we have closely
monitored the trends in economic factors and their effects on operating results to determine if an
impairment trigger was present that would warrant a reassessment of the recoverability of the
carrying amount of goodwill prior to the required annual impairment test and performed interim
impairment tests when warranted. The macroeconomic factors that affect our industry, primarily the
continued decline in housing starts, have caused us to re-evaluate our expectations for a number of
our reporting units. Housing starts are a significant sales driver for us. If there is a
significant decline or an expected decline in housing starts, this could adversely affect our
expectations for a reporting unit and the value of that reporting unit. In 2008, the overriding
factor was the continued decline in the macroeconomic conditions that affect our industry,
specifically housing starts in our markets were down 42.7% from 2007 and down 45.7% in the fourth
quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. We recognized goodwill impairments of $39.9
million which were included in asset impairments in our consolidated statements of operations. We
did not have any goodwill impairments in continuing operations in 2010 or 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of fair value of
our reporting units. Our reporting units: Atlantic, Raleigh, Southeast, Florida, Dallas and South
Texas represent financially discrete, self-sustaining components of our three regional operating
segments. We evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to
identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the book value,
including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the book value, goodwill is not
impaired. If the book value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the process is performed to
measure the amount of impairment. In step two, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is
allocated to all other assets and liabilities of that reporting unit based on their respective fair
values. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amount allocated to its assets
and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Goodwill impairment is measured as the
excess of the carrying value over its implied fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is
estimated based upon the projected discounted cash flow expected to be generated from the reporting
unit using a discounted cash flow methodology. Where available and appropriate, comparative market
multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We developed a range of fair values for our reporting units using a five-year discounted cash
flow methodology. Inherent in such fair value determinations are estimates relating to future cash
flows, including revenue growth, gross margins, operating expenses and long-term growth rates, and
our interpretation of current economic indicators and market conditions and their impact on our
strategic plans and operations. Due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates,
interpretations and assumptions, actual results could differ from projected results, and further
impairment of goodwill could be recorded.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significant information and assumptions utilized in estimating future cash flows for our
reporting units includes publicly available industry information on projected single-family housing
starts and lumber commodity prices which are used to project revenue. Projected gross margins and
operating expenses reflect the impact of recent headcount reductions and other cost reduction
initiatives and are flexed in future years based upon historical trends at various revenue levels.
Long-term growth was based upon terminal value earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA)&nbsp;multiples of 5.5x for all reporting units to reflect the relevant expected
acquisition price. A discount rate of 15.1% was used for all reporting units and is intended to
reflect the weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant and includes all
risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows.
Decreasing the long-term growth to an EBITDA multiple of 4.5x, or increasing the discount rate by
1.0% to 16.1%, would not have changed the results of our impairment testing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the excess (or &#147;cushion&#148;) of the implied fair value of goodwill over the
carrying value of goodwill for each of our five reporting units which have remaining goodwill
balances ranged from $8.5&nbsp;million to $91.5&nbsp;million. The cushion for two of our reporting units at
December&nbsp;31, 2010, was $8.5&nbsp;million and $20.6&nbsp;million. Moderate deviations from projected cash
flows for these reporting units could result in future goodwill impairment. These reporting units
had goodwill balances of $11.0&nbsp;million and $5.1&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. Factors that could
negatively impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and potentially trigger
additional impairment include, but are not limited to, unexpected competition, lower than expected
housing starts, an increase in our weighted average cost of capital, increases in material or labor
cost, and significant declines in our market capitalization. Future non-cash impairment of goodwill
would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period, but would
not impact our current outstanding debt obligations or compliance with covenants contained in the
related debt agreements. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we reconciled to within a reasonable range our
estimated fair value as determined by the sum of the discounted cash flows of our reporting units
to our market capitalization, using an estimated control premium of 29.3%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Deferred Income Taxes. </I>We assess whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our
deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider the reversal of existing deferred tax
liabilities, future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in our assessment. We have certain
state income tax carryforwards where we believe it is unlikely that we will realize the benefits
associated with these tax carryforwards and have established a valuation allowance against our
deferred tax assets. Changes in our estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies
will affect our estimate of the realization of the tax benefits of these tax carryforwards.
Additionally, in light of the continued downturn in the housing market and the uncertainty as to
its length and magnitude, and due to the additional asset impairments recorded during 2008, we were
in a three-year cumulative loss position. Cumulative losses in recent years represent significant
negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable, and also usually
preclude relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax
assets. Therefore, during 2008, we recorded a valuation allowance totaling $41.2&nbsp;million against
primarily all of our net deferred tax assets, of which $31.6&nbsp;million related to our continuing
operations, $3.0&nbsp;million related to other comprehensive (loss)&nbsp;income and $6.6&nbsp;million related to
our discontinued operations. We recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately $35.4
million and $3.9&nbsp;million related to our continuing operations in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Further declines in housing activity could cause us to establish additional valuation allowances.
To the extent we generate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully utilize the tax benefits
of the related net deferred tax assets, we may reverse some or all of the valuation allowances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Insurance Deductible Reserve. </I>We have large deductibles for general liability, auto liability
and workers&#146; compensation insurance. The expected liability for unpaid claims falling within our
deductible, including incurred but not reported losses, is determined using the assistance of a
third-party actuary. This amount is reflected on our balance sheet as an accrued liability. Our
accounting policy includes an internal evaluation and adjustment of our reserve for all
insurance-related liabilities on a quarterly basis. At least on an annual basis, we engage an
external actuarial professional to independently assess and estimate the total liability
outstanding, which is compared to the actual reserve balance at that time and adjusted accordingly.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stock-Based Compensation. </I>Calculating stock-based compensation expense requires the input of
subjective assumptions. We determine the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data. Specific inputs to the
model include: the expected life of the stock-based awards, stock price volatility, dividend yield
and risk-free rate.

topic of the Codification which requires, in both interim as well as annual financial statements,
for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, disclosures
regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used to develop those measurements. It also requires
separate disclosures of significant amounts transferred in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair
value measurements and a description of the reasons for the transfers. We have adopted these
provisions and included all required disclosures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance under the <I>Multiple Element Revenue Arrangements</I>
topic of the Codification which requires separation of the consideration received in such
arrangements by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a
deliverable, which will be based on available information in the following order: vendor-specific
objective evidence, third-party evidence, or estimated selling price. It also eliminates the
residual method of allocation, requires that the consideration be allocated at the inception of the
arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method, which allocates any
discount in the arrangement to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable&#146;s selling price,
and requires that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is
consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis.
These changes became effective for us on January&nbsp;1, 2011. We are currently reviewing the impact
of these changes on our financial statements, but we do not expect these changes to have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Codification which addresses diversity in the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings
disclosure requirements for business combinations. The guidance states if a public entity presents
comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined
entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as
of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. This guidance became
effective on January&nbsp;1, 2011. It had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.

the Codification which modifies Step1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero

test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Builders FirstSource, Inc.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in stockholders&#146; equity and cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Builders FirstSource, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2010,
based on criteria established in <I>Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework </I>issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing
under Item&nbsp;9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Builders FirstSource, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in 1998, is a leading supplier and
manufacturer of structural and related building products for residential new construction in the
United States. In this annual report, references to the &#147;company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;ours&#148; or &#147;us&#148;

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We manage our business as three regional operating groups &#151; Atlantic, Southeast and Central.
We serve 32 markets in 9 states, principally in the southern and eastern United States. We have 52
distribution centers and 47 manufacturing facilities, many of which are located on the same
premises as our distribution centers. We serve a broad customer base ranging from production
homebuilders to small custom homebuilders.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial position,
and cash flows of Builders FirstSource, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Accounting Estimates</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from
those estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates are used when accounting for items such as revenue, vendor rebates, allowance for
returns, discounts and doubtful accounts, employee compensation programs, depreciation and
amortization periods, income taxes, inventory values, insurance programs, goodwill, other
intangible assets and long-lived assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Sales Recognition</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize sales of building products upon delivery to the customer. For contracts with
service elements, sales are generally recognized on the completed contract method as these
contracts are usually completed within 30&nbsp;days. Contract costs include all direct material and
labor, equipment costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance. Provisions for
estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which such losses are
determined. Prepayments for materials or services are deferred until such materials have been
delivered or services have been provided. All sales recognized are net of allowances for discounts
and estimated returns, based on historical experience. We present all sales tax on a net basis in
our consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity date of three months or less.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Financial Instruments</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use financial instruments in the normal course of business as a tool to manage our assets
and liabilities. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We utilize interest rate swaps in order to mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk that
we are exposed to in the normal course of business on our floating rate notes. We measure our
interest rate swaps at fair value on a recurring basis as discussed in Note 8.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We extend credit to qualified professional homebuilders and contractors, in many cases on a
non-collateralized basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management&#146;s assessment
of the amount which may become uncollectible in the future and is estimated using specific review
of problem accounts, overall portfolio quality, current economic conditions that may affect the
borrower&#146;s ability to pay, and historical experience. Accounts receivable are written off when
deemed uncollectible.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories consist principally of materials purchased for resale, including lumber, sheet
goods, windows, doors and millwork, as well as certain manufactured products and are stated at the
lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the weighted average method, the use of which
approximates the first-in, first-out method. We accrue for shrinkage based on the actual historical
shrinkage results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current
economic conditions. These estimates are compared with actual results as physical inventory counts
are taken and reconciled to the general ledger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year, we monitor our inventory levels by market and record provisions for excess
inventories based on slower moving inventory. We define potential excess inventory as the amount of
inventory on hand in excess of the historical usage, excluding special order items purchased in the
last three months. We then apply our judgment as to forecasted demand and other factors, including
liquidation value, to determine the required adjustments to net realizable value. Our inventories
are generally not susceptible to technological obsolescence.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our arrangements with vendors provide for rebates of a specified amount of consideration,
payable when certain measures, generally related to a stipulated level of purchases, have been
achieved. We account for estimated rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendor&#146;s inventory
until the product is sold, at which time such rebates reduce cost of sales in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. Throughout the year we estimate the amount of the rebates
based upon the expected level of purchases. We continually revise these estimates based on actual
purchase levels.

in Note 8, we offered all shareholders the right to purchase additional shares at an offering price
of $3.50 per share. At the inception of our rights offering the offering price was lower than the
fair value of our common stock, thus creating a bonus element which requires us to retroactively

share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are deemed
participating securities and should be considered in the calculation of basic EPS. Since the
restricted stock shares do not include an obligation to share in losses, they will be included in
our basic EPS calculation in periods of net income and excluded from our basic EPS calculation in
periods of net loss. Accordingly, there were 1,865,000, 61,000 and 389,000 restricted stock shares
excluded from the computation of basic EPS in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, because we

consider the contractual term, the vesting period and the expected lives used by a peer group with
similar option terms in determining the expected life assumption. The expected volatility is based
on the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period equal to the expected
life of the option. The expected dividend yield is based on our history of not paying regular
dividends in the past and our current intention to not pay regular dividends in the foreseeable
future. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant
and has a term equal to the expected life of the options. We did not grant any stock option awards
in 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued guidance under the <I>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</I>
topic of the Codification which requires, in both interim as well as annual financial statements,
for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, disclosures
regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used to develop those measurements. It also requires
separate disclosures of significant amounts transferred in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair
value measurements and a description of the reasons for the transfers. We have adopted these
provisions and included all required disclosures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance under the <I>Multiple Element Revenue Arrangements</I>
topic of the Codification which requires separation of the consideration received in such
arrangements by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a
deliverable, which will be based on available information in the following order: vendor-specific
objective evidence, third-party evidence, or estimated selling price. It also eliminates the
residual method of allocation, requires that the consideration be allocated at the inception of the
arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method, which allocates any
discount in the arrangement to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable&#146;s selling price,
and requires that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is
consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis.
These changes became effective for us on January&nbsp;1, 2011. We are currently reviewing the impact
of these changes on our financial statements, but we do not expect these changes to have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2010, the FASB issued guidance under the <I>Business Combinations </I>topic of the
Codification which addresses diversity in the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings
disclosure requirements for business combinations. The guidance states if a public entity presents
comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined
entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as
of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. This guidance became
effective on January&nbsp;1, 2011. It had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of 2008, we closely monitored trends in economic factors and their effects
on operating results to determine if an impairment trigger was present that would warrant a
reassessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill prior to the required annual
impairment test in accordance with the <I>Intangibles &#151; Goodwill and Other </I>topic of the Codification.
During the second quarter of 2008, the macroeconomic factors that drive our business declined
further prompting us to revise our expectations and perform an interim impairment test related to
our Florida reporting unit which was significantly underperforming original expectations and which
also had a smaller valuation surplus compared to our other reporting units. Based on the results of
this interim testing, we determined that the carrying value of goodwill for our Florida reporting
unit exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded a $3.5&nbsp;million pre-tax impairment charge. We
performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2008 and as a result of a further
decline in the macroeconomic factors that drive our business and in the valuation surplus for this
reporting unit, we recorded an additional $36.4&nbsp;million pre-tax impairment charge for our Florida
reporting unit. These charges were included in asset impairments in
the consolidated statement of operations for 2008. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had no

further goodwill value on the balance sheet for our Florida reporting unit. We recorded no
goodwill impairment charges in continuing operations in 2010 and 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of fair value of
our reporting units. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates
relating to future cash flows, including our interpretation of current economic indicators and
market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations. Due to
the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates
resulting in further impairment of goodwill.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing our impairment analysis, we developed a range of fair values for our reporting
units using a discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flow methodology establishes
fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from
the reporting unit. The discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the
present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing
the stream of projected future cash flows. The discounted cash flow methodology uses our
projections of financial performance for a five-year period. The most significant assumptions used
in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate, the terminal value and the expected
future revenues, gross margins and operating expenses, which vary among reporting units.
Significant assumptions used in our financial projections include housing starts, lumber commodity
prices, and market share gains.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, we recorded $4.0&nbsp;million in goodwill impairment for our Ohio operations which are now
included in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax as discussed in Note 4.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, we recorded a $4.4&nbsp;million charge to fully impair certain customer relationship
intangibles as their carrying values were not expected to be recovered from future cash flows. This
charge was included in asset impairments in the consolidated statement of operations for 2008.
During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded amortization expense in
relation to the above-listed intangible assets of $0.5&nbsp;million, $1.3&nbsp;million, and $2.1&nbsp;million,
respectively. The following table presents the estimated amortization expense for these intangible
assets for the years ending December&nbsp;31 (in thousands):

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>2007 Senior Secured Credit Agreement</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, we entered into a $350&nbsp;million revolving credit facility (the &#147;2007 Agreement&#148;) with
a consortium of banks. The 2007 Agreement is scheduled to mature in December&nbsp;2012, but will mature
in November&nbsp;2011 if we have not repaid or extended the maturity of all the outstanding 2012 notes
by that time. The available borrowing capacity, or borrowing base, under the $350&nbsp;million revolving
credit line is derived primarily from a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable and
inventory, as defined by the agreement. During 2009, we reduced the maximum borrowing capacity
under the 2007 Agreement from $350&nbsp;million to $250&nbsp;million as allowed by the 2007 Agreement. In
November&nbsp;2010, we amended the 2007 Agreement, further reducing the maximum borrowing capacity from
$250&nbsp;million to $150&nbsp;million. We do not anticipate that our borrowing base will support borrowings
in excess of these amounts at any point during the remaining life of the credit facility. These
reductions allowed us to reduce our interest expense related to commitment fees. As part of these
reductions, we expensed $0.6&nbsp;million and $1.2&nbsp;million related to unamortized debt issuance costs
in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The amendment also reduced our minimum liquidity requirement,
which was previously $35.0&nbsp;million and which is now determined on a sliding scale based on our
ninety-day average gross availability, as follows:

<!-- xbrl -->


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest rates under the 2007 Agreement are based on a base rate plus an applicable margin.
The base rate is the larger of the rate determined by the administrative agent (typically their
prime rate) or the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half percent, as each term is defined by the
agreement. A variable commitment fee, currently 0.425%, is charged on the unused amount of the
revolver and is based on our quarterly average excess availability. The weighted-average interest
rate at December&nbsp;31, 2010 for borrowings outstanding under the 2007 Agreement was 3.75%. At
December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $15.9&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, primarily accounts receivable and
inventory, and are guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries. Our net borrowing availability
in excess of the required minimum liquidity covenant at December&nbsp;31, 2010 was $22.6&nbsp;million. The
2007 Agreement has certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the payment
of dividends, incurrence of indebtedness, and asset sales. We were not in violation of any of these
covenants as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. The 2007 Agreement also has a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:1
that is triggered if our available borrowing capacity, as determined under the borrowing base
formula, is less than a minimum liquidity requirement. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the minimum liquidity
requirement was $10.0&nbsp;million. The calculation allows cash on deposit with the agent to be
included as eligible borrowing base. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we were not required to have any cash on
deposit with the agent since there was no shortfall in the calculation of the $10.0&nbsp;million minimum
liquidity requirement. If the $10.0&nbsp;million minimum liquidity requirement was triggered in 2010,
we would not have met the fixed charge coverage ratio. Based on our 2011 forecast, while we will
not meet the fixed charge coverage ratio, we anticipate that we will not fall below the minimum
liquidity covenant in 2011 including the use of cash on deposit with the agent; therefore, we will
not trigger the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement. The fixed charge coverage ratio is defined
as the ratio of earnings before interest expenses, income taxes, depreciation and amortization
expenses minus capital expenditures, cash taxes paid, dividends, distributions and share
repurchases or redemptions to the sum of scheduled principal payments and interest expense on a
trailing twelve month basis from the trigger date.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had $275.0&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate
Notes due February&nbsp;15, 2012 (&#147;2012 notes&#148;). Interest accrues at a rate of LIBOR plus 4.25%. LIBOR
is reset at the beginning of each quarterly period. The weighted-average interest rate at December
31, 2010 for the remaining 2012 notes was 4.5%. Interest on the 2012 notes is payable quarterly in
arrears. At any time, we can redeem some or all of the 2012 notes at par. In the event of a change
in control, we may be required to offer to purchase the 2012 notes at a purchase price equal to
101% of the principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had $5.3&nbsp;million
in outstanding 2012 notes, as we repaid or exchanged substantially all of the notes as part of the
debt exchange discussed below. We intend to repay the $5.3&nbsp;million of outstanding 2012
notes during 2011, and therefore have classified this amount as a
current liability as of December 31, 2010 in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;21, 2010, we completed a common stock rights offering and debt exchange for our
2012 notes. As part of these transactions, we raised $180.1&nbsp;million of new equity capital through
the issuance of 51,459,184 shares of common stock in the rights offering at a subscription price of
$3.50 per share. We used $105.1&nbsp;million of the proceeds from the rights offering to repurchase a
portion of the 2012 notes in the debt exchange. We used a portion of the remaining $75.0&nbsp;million of
proceeds to pay expenses of the rights offering and the debt exchange and the remainder is being
used for general corporate purposes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debt exchange, holders of the 2012 notes exchanged, at par, $269.8&nbsp;million aggregate
principal amount of 2012 notes for (i) $139.7&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of Second Priority
Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2016 (&#147;2016 notes&#148;), (ii) $105.1&nbsp;million in cash from the
proceeds of the rights offering, and (iii)&nbsp;7,112,244 shares of our common stock. We also amended
the indenture under which the 2012 notes were issued to eliminate substantially all of the
restrictive covenants, certain conditions to defeasance, and certain events of default and to
release the liens on the collateral securing the 2012 notes. As a result of the debt exchange, we
reduced our indebtedness by $130.0&nbsp;million and extended the maturity of $139.7&nbsp;million of
indebtedness until 2016. There was no gain or loss recognized on the extinguishment of the 2012
notes since the notes were exchanged at par value for cash and common stock which had a closing
price on the transaction date that was equal to the exchange price of $3.50 per share. At December
31, 2010, our funded debt was $165.0&nbsp;million, which consisted of $20.0&nbsp;million of outstanding
borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility, $139.7&nbsp;million of 2016 notes, and
$5.3&nbsp;million of our remaining 2012 notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with our rights offering and debt exchange, we incurred approximately $9.4
million of various third-party fees and expenses. Of the total costs incurred, $0.5&nbsp;million, net of
insurance recoveries, related to the settlement of the consolidated class and derivative action
lawsuit involving our initial recapitalization plans and $2.6&nbsp;million primarily related to the
special committee formed

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">to review and respond to the recapitalization proposal. Substantially all of these costs were
incurred and expensed in 2009 as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. The
remaining $6.3&nbsp;million of costs incurred were considered to be directly related to the issuance of
the common stock and the 2016 notes in the rights offering and debt exchange. These costs were
allocated to the debt and equity based on their relative fair value to the total consideration
issued in the transaction. Accordingly, $3.7&nbsp;million was allocated to the rights offering and
recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the first quarter of 2010. The remaining
$2.6&nbsp;million of costs were allocated to the 2016 notes and expensed primarily in the first quarter
of 2010 as a component of interest expense, net. The debt exchange was considered to be a
modification, and therefore, any third-party costs were expensed as incurred. In addition, $1.6
million of unamortized debt issue costs related to the 2012 notes that were extinguished as part of
the transaction were expensed in the first quarter of 2010 and also included in interest expense,
net. The remaining $1.9&nbsp;million of unamortized debt issue costs are being amortized over the term
of the outstanding floating rate notes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we have $139.7&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of new 2016
notes that mature on February&nbsp;15, 2016. Interest accrues on the 2016 notes at a 3-month LIBOR
(subject to a 3.0% floor) plus 10.0%. LIBOR is reset at the beginning of each quarterly period. The
weighted-average interest rate at December&nbsp;31, 2010 for the 2016 notes was 13.0%. Interest on the
2016 notes is payable quarterly in arrears. At any time we can redeem some or all of the 2016 notes
at a redemption price equal to par plus a specified premium that declines ratably to par. In the
event of a change in control, we may be required to offer to purchase the 2016 notes at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

thereof now owned or hereafter acquired by us and substantially all of our subsidiaries. All of the
subsidiaries are wholly-owned and domiciled in the United States. The parent company has no
independent assets or operations, and the guarantees are full and unconditional. The indenture
covering the 2016 notes contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Interest Rate Swaps</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first quarter of 2008, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with
notional amounts of $100.0&nbsp;million, $50.0&nbsp;million and $50.0&nbsp;million. We entered into these interest
rate swaps in order to mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk that we were exposed to in the
normal course of business on our floating rate notes. The swap agreements, effective May&nbsp;15, 2008,
were for a term of three years. The interest rate swaps qualified as fully effective, cash-flow
hedging instruments. Therefore, all changes in fair value of the qualifying cash flow hedges were
reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the
same period in which the hedge transactions affected earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, certain conditions of the proposed recapitalization plan were met which
indicated that the transaction was considered probable of occurring. The recapitalization plan
reduced our outstanding floating rate notes to $145.0&nbsp;million causing a portion of the future cash
flows being hedged by our $200&nbsp;million swaps to be deemed probable of not occurring. As a result,
in December&nbsp;2009 we cancelled and settled our $50&nbsp;million swap with a fixed rate of 2.99% for $1.7
million. Primarily all of this payment was expensed and was included as a component of interest
expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009.
Under the remaining $100&nbsp;million and $50&nbsp;million swap agreements, we are paying fixed rates of
3.25% and 3.17%, respectively, and receiving a variable rate at 90&nbsp;day LIBOR. In December&nbsp;2009, we
also de-designated the remaining $150&nbsp;million of our swaps. Amounts included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss for $5.0&nbsp;million of the remaining swaps were reclassed to expense in
2009 as the cash flows being hedged were considered probable of not occurring. Amounts included in
accumulated other comprehensive loss at December&nbsp;31, 2009 related to the remaining $145.0
million of swaps were frozen and will be amortized over the remaining terms of the swaps. Any
subsequent changes in the fair value of these swaps are recognized in interest expense, net, in the
consolidated statement of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our interest rate swap agreements are in a net asset position, we are exposed to credit
losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties. The amount of such credit exposure is
limited to the unrealized gains on our swaps. We have not experienced any credit loss as a result
of counterparty nonperformance in the past. To manage credit risks, we generally select
counterparties who are part of our banking syndicate and settle on a net basis. We perform a
quarterly assessment of our counterparty credit risk, including a review of credit ratings, credit
default swap rates, and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Since the counterparty is
part of the bank syndicate, we also would have the ability to net amounts owed to us against any
outstanding borrowings under the 2007 Agreement, thereby reducing the credit risk.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When interest rate swap agreements are in a net liability position, we are required to
establish a reserve against our borrowing base equal to 110% of the fair value of the interest rate
swaps on the last day of the month. This reserve effectively reduces our available borrowing
capacity under the 2007 Agreement. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, the reserve for the swaps was $2.4
million. The swaps are also collateralized in a manner similar to the loans under the 2007
Agreement. In the event of default, or if we or the counterparty fail to be part of the 2007
Agreement, an early termination event would be triggered which could require us to settle the swaps
on the termination date at the then fair market value.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <I>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures </I>topic of the Codification provides a framework for
measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and establishes a fair value hierarchy that
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value hierarchy can be summarized as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1 &#151; unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets
accessible by us
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2 &#151; inputs that are observable in the marketplace other than those inputs classified as
Level 1
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3 &#151; inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace and significant to the valuation
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the
instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value calculation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are our interest
rate swaps. We do not trade in swaps or hold them for speculative purposes, therefore, the retail
market that exists for swaps would be the most advantageous market for our interest rate swaps. As
such, we use the market approach to value our interest rate swaps by obtaining a quote from the
counterparty that is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates information
obtained from third-party market sources and is adjusted for company specific credit risk. We
validate the fair value quote obtained from the counterparty by using an independent, third-party
discounted cash flow analysis which also utilizes market information. These techniques incorporate
Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. In addition to the term and notional amount inputs, the valuation also
factors in discount rate, forward yield curves, and credit

to our 2007 Plan which increased the number of shares of common stock that may be granted pursuant
to awards under the 2007 Plan from 2.5&nbsp;million shares to 7.0&nbsp;million shares. The maximum number of

The 2007 Plan also provides that all awards will become fully vested and/or exercisable upon a
change in control (as defined in the 2007 Plan). Other specific terms for awards granted under the
2007 Plan shall be determined by our Compensation Committee (or the board of directors if so

further grants will be made under the 1998 Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;23, 2008, we filed a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule&nbsp;TO (the &#147;Exchange Offer&#148;)
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Exchange Offer was an offer by us to certain
optionholders to exchange their outstanding stock option grants, whether vested or unvested, to
purchase shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, granted under the 2005 Plan with an
exercise price per share greater than or equal to $17.90 for new option grants to be granted under
the 2005 Plan. The Exchange Offer was made to employees who, as of the date the Exchange Offer
commenced, were actively employed by us and held eligible option grants. The Exchange Offer was
approved by our shareholders at our annual meeting on May&nbsp;22, 2008. We accepted for cancellation,
eligible option grants to purchase an aggregate of 943,200 shares of our common stock, representing
100% of the total shares of common stock underlying options eligible for exchange in the Exchange
Offer on May&nbsp;22, 2008, the expiration date of the Exchange Offer. Contemporaneous with the
cancellation, our board of directors granted an equivalent number of stock options to the eligible
employees on May&nbsp;22, 2008 with an exercise price of $7.15, which was the closing price of our
common stock on that date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange of original options for new option grants was treated as a modification of the
original options. The remaining unamortized stock compensation expense related to the original
options continues to be amortized over the original vesting period related to those options. The
compensation expense for the incremental difference between the fair value of the new options and
the fair value of the original options on the date of modification, reflecting the current facts
and circumstances on the modification date, is being amortized over the vesting period of the new

manufacturing facilities in Florida, and two manufacturing facilities in Maryland. We also closed
two distribution facilities: one in South Carolina and one in North Carolina. We recognized $0.7&nbsp;million in expense, which was
primarily related to employee severance and termination benefits for these idled and closed
facilities and revisions to sub-rental income estimates on other closed facilities. Of the $0.7
million recognized in expense during 2010, $0.6 was included in facility closure costs and $0.1
million was included in interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009, we developed and executed a plan to close a distribution facility in Maryland and
an administrative facility in South Carolina. In 2009, we recognized $1.4&nbsp;million in expense,
which was primarily related to future minimum lease obligations on these vacated facilities, net of
estimated sub-rental lease income, as well as lease termination costs and revisions to sub-rental
income estimates. Of the $1.4&nbsp;million we recognized in expense during 2009, $1.2&nbsp;million was
included in facility closure costs and $0.2&nbsp;million was included in interest expense, net in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, we idled three facilities: a manufacturing facility and a distribution facility
in Florida, as well as a distribution facility in Georgia. We also developed and executed a plan
to close four facilities located in North Carolina, Georgia and Texas. In conjunction with this
plan, we disposed of assets and terminated employees. We sold owned real estate related to closed
facilities for approximately $0.9&nbsp;million resulting in an immaterial loss on the sale. During 2008,
we recognized approximately $1.4&nbsp;million in expense related to closed facilities, of which $1.2
million was included in facility closure costs and $0.2&nbsp;million was included in interest expense,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facility and other exit cost reserves of $1.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010, of which $1.1
million is recorded as other long-term liabilities, are primarily related to future minimum lease
payments on vacated facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As plans to close facilities are developed and executed, assets that can be used at other
facilities are transferred and assets to be abandoned or sold are written down to their net
realizable value, including any long-lived assets. In situations where multiple facilities serve
the same market we may temporary close, or idle, facilities with plans to reopen these facilities
once demand returns to the market. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had ten idled facilities; four in
Florida, three in South Carolina, two in Maryland and one in Georgia. In these situations, finite
lived assets continue to be depreciated and assessed for impairment. Should conditions in our
markets worsen, or recovery take significantly longer than forecasted, we may temporarily idle or
permanently close additional facilities, at which time we may incur additional facility closure
costs or asset impairment charges. Future non-cash impairment charges would have the effect of
decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period, but would not impact our current
outstanding debt obligations or compliance with covenants contained in the related debt agreements.
We continuously monitor economic conditions in all our markets, and while at the present time there
are no plans to close or idle additional facilities, changes in market conditions may warrant
future closings or idling of facilities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have $474.7&nbsp;million
of state operating loss carry-forwards and $2.8&nbsp;million of state tax
credit carry-forwards expiring at various dates through 2031. We also have $121.7&nbsp;million of
federal net operating loss carry-forwards that will expire at various dates through 2031. The
federal and state operating loss carry-forwards exclude approximately $1.8&nbsp;million of gross
windfall tax benefits from stock option exercises that have not been recorded as of December&nbsp;31,
2010. These deferred tax assets will be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital when
the related tax benefits are realized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We evaluate our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation
allowance is required. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our
determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. In light of the continued downturn in the housing market and the
uncertainty as to its length and magnitude and the additional asset impairments recorded during
2008, we were in a three-year cumulative loss position. Cumulative losses in recent years represent
significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable, and also
generally preclude relying on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of
deferred tax assets. Therefore, during 2008, we recorded a valuation allowance totaling
approximately $41.2&nbsp;million against primarily all of our net deferred tax assets, of which $31.6
million related to our continuing operations, $3.0&nbsp;million related to other comprehensive (loss)
income, and $6.6&nbsp;million related to our discontinued operations. We recorded an additional
valuation allowance of approximately $35.4&nbsp;million and $3.9&nbsp;million in 2010 and 2009, respectively,
related to our continuing operations. We excluded the deferred tax liabilities related to certain
indefinite lived intangibles when calculating the amount of valuation allowance needed as these
liabilities cannot be considered as a source of income when determining the realizability of the
net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded as a reduction to income tax benefit.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deferred tax assets for which there is no valuation allowance relate to amounts that can
be realized through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences or through the
generation of sufficient taxable income. To the extent we generate sufficient taxable income in the
future to fully utilize the tax benefits of the net deferred tax assets on which a valuation
allowance was recorded, our effective tax rate may decrease as the valuation allowance is reversed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;6, 2009, the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 was
enacted into law and extended the carry-back period to up to five years for which current year
losses can be offset against previously generated taxable income. Due to this federal tax
legislation, we were able to carry back losses generated in 2009 against taxable income generated
in 2006, 2005, and 2004. As a result, we recorded an income tax receivable of approximately $33.8
million in the consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. We recognized an income tax
benefit of $2.1&nbsp;million in continuing operations related to losses generated by our discontinued
operations due to this change in tax law. No state in which we file adopted the Act, and as such
no state benefits were realized from the extended carry-back provision.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We accrue interest and penalties on our uncertain tax positions as a component of our
provision for income taxes. We accrued interest and penalties of $0.1&nbsp;million, $0.1&nbsp;million and
$0.1&nbsp;million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We also reduced interest and penalties by $0.5
million in 2008 due to settlements with taxing authorities and the lapse of applicable statutes of
limitations. We had a total of $0.4 and $0.3&nbsp;million accrued for interest and penalties for our
uncertain tax positions as of December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lease certain land, buildings and equipment used in operations. These leases are generally
accounted for as operating leases with initial terms ranging from one to 20&nbsp;years and generally
contain renewal options. Certain operating leases are subject to contingent rentals based on
various measures, primarily consumer price index increases. Total rent expense under operating
leases was approximately $27.1&nbsp;million, $31.6&nbsp;million and $34.8&nbsp;million for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have residual value guarantees on certain equipment leases. Under these leases
we have the option of (a)&nbsp;purchasing the equipment at the end of the lease term, (b)&nbsp;arranging for
the sale of the equipment to a third party, or (c)&nbsp;returning the equipment to the lessor to sell
the equipment. If the sales proceeds in any case are less than the residual value, we are required
to reimburse the lessor for the deficiency up to a specified level as stated in each lease
agreement. If the sales proceeds exceed the residual value, we are entitled to all of such excess
amounts. The guarantees under these leases for the residual values of equipment at the end of the
respective operating lease periods approximated $1.9&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010. Based upon
the expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease
term that is materially less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement or
that we will purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term, we do not believe it is probable
that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements.
Accordingly, no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees.

December&nbsp;2009 in accordance with the terms of the settlement. Based on an agreement with our
insurance carrier this amount was expected to be reimbursed under our insurance policy and
therefore, was included in other receivables in our consolidated balance sheet as of December&nbsp;31,
2009. We also incurred additional legal fees and other administrative costs related to the lawsuit
of approximately $0.5&nbsp;million which were expensed in the consolidated statement of operations in

Sherman, our president and chief executive officer, serves on the board of directors for PGT, Inc.
We purchased windows from PGT, Inc. totaling $2.7&nbsp;million, $3.0&nbsp;million and $2.8&nbsp;million in 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively. We had accounts payable to PGT, Inc. in the amounts of $0.3&nbsp;million

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid approximately $1.3&nbsp;million, $1.3&nbsp;million and $1.4&nbsp;million,

Pincus each exercised rights to acquire 12.9&nbsp;million shares of common stock at a subscription price
of $3.50 per share and exchanged their 2012 notes for $80.1&nbsp;million in cash and $17.7&nbsp;million of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain cash at financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. Accounts
receivable potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk. We provide credit in the normal
course of business to customers in the residential construction industry. We perform ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses. Because customers
are dispersed among our various markets, our credit risk to any one customer or state economy is
not significant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our customer mix is a balance of large national homebuilders, regional homebuilders and local
homebuilders. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, our top 10 customers accounted for
approximately 23.8% of our sales, and no single customer accounted for more than 5% of sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We source products from a large number of suppliers. No materials purchased from any single
supplier represented more than 9% of our total materials purchases in 2010.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Disclosure Controls Evaluation and Related CEO and CFO Certifications. </I>Our management, with
the participation of our principal executive officer (&#147;CEO&#148;) and principal financial officer
(&#147;CFO&#148;), conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. The controls
evaluation was conducted by our Disclosure Committee, comprised of senior representatives from our
finance, accounting, internal audit, and legal departments under the supervision of our CEO and
CFO.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certifications of our CEO and our CFO, which are required in accordance with Rule&nbsp;13a-14 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (&#147;Exchange Act&#148;), are attached as exhibits to this
annual report. This &#147;Controls and Procedures&#148; section includes the information concerning the
controls evaluation referred to in the certifications, and it should be read in conjunction with
the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. </I>We do not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A system of controls and procedures, no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the system are met. Because of the limitations in all such systems, no evaluation
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
Company have been detected. Furthermore, the design of any system of controls and procedures is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions, regardless of how unlikely. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective
system of controls and procedures, misstatements or omissions due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Scope of the Controls Evaluation. </I>The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
included a review of their objectives and design, the Company&#146;s implementation of the controls and
procedures and the effect of the controls and procedures on the information generated for use in
this annual report. In the course of the evaluation, we sought to identify whether we had any data
errors, control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action,
including process improvements, were being undertaken if needed. This type of evaluation is
performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions concerning the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures can be reported in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Many of the
components of our disclosure controls and procedures are also evaluated by our internal audit
department, our legal department and by personnel in our finance organization. The overall goals of
these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures on an
ongoing basis, and to maintain them as dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Conclusions regarding Disclosure Controls. </I>Based on the required evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we
maintained disclosure controls and procedures that were effective in providing reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC&#146;s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. </I>Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in
Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control &#151;
Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.

likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
