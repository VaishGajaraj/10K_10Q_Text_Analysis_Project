<P><FONT SIZE=3>Portions of the Proxy  Statement for the Annual  Meeting of  Shareholders  to be
held April 17, 2000,  dated March 15, 2000, are  incorporated  by reference into
Part III.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="item1"></a><P><I><B>Item 1. Business</B></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Bridge  Bancorp,  Inc. (the  "Registrant"  or  "Company")  is a registered  bank
holding company, the sole subsidiary of which is The Bridgehampton National Bank
(the "Bank").  The Registrant  was organized as a New York business  corporation
and  incorporated  under  the laws of the  State  of New  York in  1988,  at the
direction  of the Board of  Directors  of the Bank for the purpose of becoming a
bank holding company  pursuant to a plan of  reorganization;  under the plan the
former  stockholders of the Bank became the  stockholders of the Company.  Since
commencing business in March 1989 after the  reorganization,  the Registrant has
functioned primarily as the holder of all of the Bank's common stock.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>At present,  the  Registrant  does not own or lease any property and has no paid
employees.  The Registrant uses the Bank's space and employees  without separate
payment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Bank was established in 1910 as a national banking  association and is under
the supervision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "O.C.C.").
Its headquarters are located at 2200 Montauk  Highway,  Bridgehampton,  New York
11932.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Bank engages in full  service  commercial  and consumer  banking and limited
trust business,  including accepting time and demand deposits, as well as making
secured and unsecured  commercial and consumer loans,  including auto, personal,
home equity, home improvement,  residential and commercial mortgages, commercial
construction and S.B.A.  guaranteed loans. In addition, the Bank offers merchant
credit and debit card processing,  automated  teller  machines,  cash management
services, safe deposit boxes and individual retirement accounts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Bank employs 97 people on a full-time and part-time basis. The Bank provides
a variety  of  employment  benefits  and  considers  its  relationship  with its
employees to be positive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>All phases of the Bank's business are highly  competitive.  The Bank's market is
primarily  the  trade  areas of the North and  South  Forks of  Eastern  Suffolk
County,  with  concentrations  in the  Bridgehampton,  East Hampton,  Greenport,
Mattituck,  Montauk, Sag Harbor, Southampton,  and Southold, New York areas. The
Bank  considers its major  competition to be local  commercial  banks as well as
other commercial banks with branches in the Bank's market area.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>REGULATION</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>References  in this section to  applicable  statutes and  regulations  are brief
summaries  only,  and do not purport to be complete.  The reader should  consult
such statutes and regulations themselves for a full understanding of the details
of their operation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Registrant is subject to the  provisions of the Bank Holding  Company Act of
1956, as amended (the "Act") and to  supervision  by the Federal  Reserve Board.
The Act  requires  the  Registrant  to secure the prior  approval of the Federal
Reserve  Board before it can acquire all or  substantially  all of the assets of
any bank, or acquire ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank other
than the Bank,  if after such  acquisition,  it would own or control more than 5
percent  of  the  voting  shares  of  such  bank.  Federal  law  also  prohibits
acquisitions  of control  of a bank  holding  company  without  prior  notice to
certain federal bank regulators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>As a bank holding  company,  the Registrant is required to file an annual report
with the Federal  Reserve Board and any  additional  information  as the Federal
Reserve  Board may require  pursuant to the Act. The Federal  Reserve  Board may
also make examinations of the Registrant and any or all of its subsidiaries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Subsidiary  banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain  restrictions
imposed by the Act on any extension of credit to the bank holding company or any
of its subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities of the bank
holding  company  or its  subsidiaries,  and on the  taking  of  such  stock  or
securities as collateral for loans to any borrower.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -1-</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The  Federal  Reserve  Board  permits  bank  holding   companies  to  engage  in
non-banking  activities so closely related to banking or managing or controlling
banks so as to be a proper incident  thereto  including,  for example,  consumer
finance  companies,  mortgage  companies,  leasing  companies,  data  processing
companies, financial advisor and securities brokerage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Federal  Reserve Board approval is required  before the Registrant or a non-bank
subsidiary of the Registrant may begin to engage in any of the above  activities
and  before  any  such  business  may be  acquired.  At the  present  time,  the
Registrant does not contemplate conduct of any non-banking  activities permitted
by the Act.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The operations of the Bank are subject to federal and state statutes  applicable
to banks  chartered  under the banking laws of the United States,  to members of
the  Federal  Reserve  System and to banks  whose  deposits  are  insured by the
Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (the "FDIC").  Bank operations are also
subject to regulations of the O.C.C.,  the Federal Reserve Board,  the FDIC, and
the New York State Banking Department.  The primary supervisory authority of the
Bank is the O.C.C., which regularly examines the Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Federal and state banking laws and  regulations  govern,  among other things the
scope of a bank's  business,  the  investments  a bank may  make,  the  reserves
against deposits a bank must maintain,  the loans a bank makes and collateral it
takes, the maximum interest rates a bank must pay on deposits, the activities of
a bank with  respect to mergers  and  consolidations  and the  establishment  of
branches.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The  Financial  Institutions  Reform,  Recovery  and  Enforcement  Act  of  1989
("FIRREA") expanded the Federal Reserve Board's authority to prohibit activities
of bank holding  companies and their  non-banking  subsidiaries  which represent
unsafe and unsound banking  practices or which constitute  violations of laws or
regulations.  FIRREA  increased  the amount of civil  money  penalties  that the
Federal Reserve Board can assess for such practices or violations. The penalties
can be as high as $1  million  per  day.  FIRREA  also  expanded  the  scope  of
individuals and entities against which such penalties may be assessed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA")
required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based  capital standards
to ensure that those  standards  take  adequate  account of interest  rate risk,
concentrations of credit risk and the risks of  non-traditional  activities,  as
well  as  reflect  the  actual   performances  and  expected  risk  of  loss  on
multi-family  mortgages.  Regulations  promulgated  under this law also required
each  federal  banking  agency  to  specify  the  levels  at  which  an  insured
institution would be considered "well  capitalized,"  "adequately  capitalized,"
"under-capitalized,"    "significantly    under-capitalized"   and   "critically
under-capitalized."  Under the regulations adopted by the banking agencies,  the
Bank is considered "well capitalized."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>FDICIA  requires bank regulators to take "prompt  corrective  action" to resolve
problems  associated  with  insured  depository  institutions.  In the  event an
institution  becomes  "under-capitalized,"  it must submit a capital restoration
plan. If an institution becomes "significantly under-capitalized" or "critically
under-capitalized,"  additional and  significant  limitations  are placed on the
institution.  The capital restoration plan of an  under-capitalized  institution
will not be accepted by the regulators  unless each company  "having control of"
the under-capitalized  institution "guarantees" the subsidiary's compliance with
the capital restoration plan until it becomes "adequately capitalized."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Under FDICIA, the aggregate liability of all companies  controlling a particular
institution  is limited to the lesser of 5% of the  institution's  assets at the
time  it  became   under-capitalized  or  the  amount  necessary  to  bring  the
institution  into compliance with applicable  capital  standards.  FDICIA grants
powers  to the  bank  regulators  in  situations  where an  institution  becomes
"significantly" or "critically  under-capitalized"  or fails to submit a capital
restoration  plan.  For example,  a bank  holding  company  controlling  such an
institution  can be required to obtain prior Federal  Reserve Board  approval of
proposed dividends, or might be required to consent to a merger or to divest the
troubled institution or other affiliates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Additionally,  Federal Reserve Board policy discourages the payment of dividends
by a bank holding  company from  borrowed  funds as well as payments  that would
adversely affect capital  adequacy.  Failure to meet the capital  guidelines may
result in implementation by the Federal Reserve Board of appropriate supervisory
or enforcement actions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The prompt  corrective  action  provisions  of FDICIA  reflect the same concerns
which gave rise to a position  adopted by the Federal Reserve Board known as the
"source of strength  doctrine,"  which is based on the Federal  Reserve  Board's
Regulation Y. Regulation Y directs bank holding  companies to "serve as a source
of financial and managerial  strength" to their subsidiary  banks, and bars them
from engaging in unsafe and unsound practices.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="item2"><I><B>Item 2. Properties</b></i></a>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Facilities of the Registrant are located at 2200 Montauk Highway, Bridgehampton,
New York in the Bank's Main Office building.  As such, the Registrant itself has
no physical properties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Bank's Main Office is owned in fee.  The Bank also owns the  building  which
houses its Southold Branch located at 54790 Main Road,  Southold,  New York. The
Bank leases seven  additional  properties as branch locations at 425 County Road
39,  Southampton,  New York; 26 Park Place,  East Hampton,  New York; Main Road,
Mattituck,  New York;  218 Front  Street,  Greenport,  New York; 94 Main Street,
Southampton,  New York;  2 Bay Street,  Sag Harbor,  New York;  and 1 The Plaza,
Montauk,  New York.  The Bank leases  additional  space at 184 Old Country Road,
Riverhead,  New York formerly used as a residential mortgage center. The Bank is
currently subletting this space.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>It is the opinion of management of the Company that the current  facilities  are
suitable and adequate at the present time.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="item3"><I><B>Item 3. Legal Proceedings</B></I></A>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Bank, and two present executive  officers and one former executive  officer,
have been named as  defendants  in a lawsuit that was filed on February 18, 1999
by two former employees in Suffolk County Supreme Court.  The plaintiffs  assert
causes  of action in  connection  with  their  employment,  conduct  of loan and
banking transactions,  and subsequent termination or resignation. The plaintiffs
seek  compensatory  and punitive  damages.  In the opinion of  management at the
present time,  after  consultation  with legal  counsel,  the lawsuit is without
merit and the ultimate outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Company's  results of operations,  business  operations or
consolidated financial condition.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>(1) On November 15,1995, the FASB issued &#147;A Guide to
Implementation of Statement No. 115 on Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities, Questions and Answers&#148; which resulted in a
reclassification of a portion of the held to maturity portfolio to available for
sale stated at fair value.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>(2) For purposes of these calculations, average stockholders&#146;
equity excludes the effect of changes in the unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on securities available for sale, net of taxes.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -4-</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>(3) On June 17, 1997, the Bank sold its former headquarters building
resulting in a gain, net of taxes, of approximately $829,000. Return on average
equity excluding this gain, net of taxes, was 18.52%. Return on average assets
excluding this gain, net of taxes, was 1.49%. On December 15, 1997 the Bank
declared a one time special dividend of approximately $845,000, or $.20 per
share, paying out this gain to the shareholders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>(4) On July 20, 1998, the Board of Directors declared a
three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable August 31,
1998, to stockholders of record as of August 19, 1998. As a result, $14,439,990
was transferred from Undivided Profits and Capital Surplus at August 19, 1998 to
reflect the issuance. On April 15, 1997, the Board of Directors declared a
three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable on May 30,
1997 to stockholders of record as of May 1, 1997. As a result, $4,801,000 was
transferred from Undivided Profits and Capital Surplus at May 1, 1997 to reflect
the issuance. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the effects of
these splits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>(5) The equity section of the balance sheet also reflects the
decrease in the par value of the Company&#146;s Common Stock from a par value of
Five Dollars ($5.00) per share to a par value of One Cent ($0.01) per share.
This change was authorized by the Board of Directors and adopted by the
Shareholders at the Company&#146;s April 19, 1999 annual meeting. The change was
effectuated during the second quarter of 1999 by filing an amendment to the
Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation. Such reduction in par value
permitted the Company to decrease its stated capital by approximately
$21,203,000. Capital surplus increased by approximately $21,203,000, thereby
providing the Company with the ability to allow payments of dividends from
surplus if deemed advisable or necessary by the Board of Directors. Capital
surplus has not been restated for prior periods. It should be realized, however,
that as a practical matter the Company would only have the ability to pay out a
moderate proportion of the aggregate increase in capital surplus as dividends
since there are regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="item7"><I><B>Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations</B></I></A>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>GENERAL</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the Company), a New York corporation, is a
one-bank holding company formed effective March 31, 1989, and on a parent only
basis, had minimal results of operations for 1999, 1998 and 1997. In the event
the Company subsequently expands its current operations, it will be dependent on
dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Bridgehampton National Bank (the
Bank), its own earnings, additional capital raised and borrowings as sources of
funds. The information below reflects principally the financial condition and
results of operations of the Bank. The Bank&#146;s results of operations are
primarily dependent on its net interest income, which is mainly the difference
between interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on
deposits. Interest income on loans and investments is a function of the average
balances outstanding and the average rates earned during a period. Interest
expense is a function of the average amount of interest bearing deposits and the
average rates paid on such deposits during a period. The Bank also generates
other income, such as fee income on deposit accounts and income from mortgage
banking operations and merchant credit card processing programs. The Bank&#146;s
net income is further affected by the level of its other expenses, such as
employees salaries and benefits and occupancy costs. This discussion and
analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the notes thereto and the other financial information included
elsewhere in this filing.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>FINANCIAL CONDITION</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The assets of the Company totaled $300,044,000 at December 31,
1999, an increase of $33,093,000 or 12.4% from the previous year end. This
increase mainly results from an increase in cash and cash equivalents of
$5,739,000 or 40.2%, an increase in debt and equity securities of $23,474,000 or
31.5%, and an increase in gross loans of $2,174,000 or 1.3%. The source of funds
for the increase in assets was derived from increased deposits of $32,791,000 or
13.6%. Demand deposits increased $9,935,000 or 13.3%. This increase is
attributed to growth in deposits affiliated with merchant processing activity
and business development efforts. Savings, N.O.W. and money market deposits
increased $25,901,000 or 25.1% and certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more
increased $5,027,000 or 23.7% over December 31, 1998; however, other time
deposits decreased $8,072,000 or 18.8% over December 31, 1998. The increase in
time deposits is attributed to increased public fund deposits, the introduction
of a new money market product targeted to high balance accounts and aggressive
business development efforts in new and existing markets including premium
pricing on certain products. The decrease in other time deposits is primarily
due to the run off of two year certificates of deposit under $100,000 that were
issued during a promotion in 1997. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Total stockholders&#146; equity was $23,672,000 at December 31,
1999, an increase of 6.5% over December 31, 1998. The increase of $1,440,000 was
the result of undistributed net income for the year ended December 31, 1999, of
$4,767,000;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -5-</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>plus the proceeds of $214,000 from the exercise of incentive
stock options pursuant to the equity incentive plan; plus the tax benefit of
$72,000 from the exercise of nonqualified stock options pursuant to the equity
incentive plan; less cash dividends declared of $1,786,000; and less the net
increase in unrealized depreciation in securities available for sale, net of
tax, of $1,827,000. The net increase in unrealized depreciation in securities
available for sale is attributable to depreciation due to changes in market
conditions. Management has determined such depreciation to be temporary, and
does not expect future sales of such securities to result in material losses and
thus a material impact on results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>STOCK SPLITS</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>On July 20, 1998, the Board of Directors declared a
three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable August 31,
1998 to stockholders of record as of August 19, 1998. The stock split increased
outstanding common shares from 1,411,599 to 4,234,797. On April 15, 1997, the
Board of Directors declared a three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock
dividend payable May 30, 1997 to stockholders of record as of May 1, 1997. The
stock split increased outstanding common shares from 469,333 to 1,407,999.
Stockholders&#146; equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to
the stock splits for all periods presented by reclassifying from undivided
profits and capital surplus to common stock the par value of additional shares
resulting from the stock splits. In addition, all references in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto to number of shares, per share amounts,
stock option data and market prices of the common stock have been restated
giving retroactive recognition to the stock splits. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>CHANGE IN PAR VALUE</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The equity section of the consolidated statements of condition
also reflects the decrease in the par value of the Company&#146;s Common Stock
from a par value of Five Dollars ($5.00) per share to a par value of One Cent
($0.01) per share. This change was authorized by the Board of Directors and
adopted by the Shareholders at the Company&#146;s April 19, 1999 annual meeting.
The change was effectuated during the second quarter of 1999 by filing an
amendment to the Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation. Such reduction in
par value permitted the Company to decrease its stated capital by approximately
$21,203,000 and increase capital surplus by a like amount, thereby providing the
Company with the ability to allow payments of dividends from surplus if deemed
advisable or necessary by the Board of Directors. Capital surplus has not been
restated for prior periods. It should be realized, however, that as a practical
matter the Company would only have the ability to pay out a moderate proportion
of the aggregate increase in capital surplus as dividends since there are
regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. See note 1(k) to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of dividend restrictions. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company&#146;s primary earnings source is net interest
income, which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates, the
relationship between rates, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset
prepayments, the level and composition of deposits, and the credit quality of
the portfolio. Management&#146;s asset/liability objectives are to maintain a
strong, stable net interest margin, to utilize its capital effectively without
taking undue risks and to maintain adequate liquidity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company&#146;s Asset/ Liability Committee, comprised of
members of senior management and the Board, meets periodically to evaluate the
impact of changes in market interest rates on assets and liabilities, net
interest margin, capital and liquidity. Risk assessments are governed by
policies and limits established by senior management which are reviewed and
approved by the full Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>As measured by the Interest Sensitivity Gap Table, the
Company&#146;s estimated one year cumulative interest sensitivity gap (the
difference between assets and liabilities that reprice or mature within such
period) was a negative $17,653,000, or (5.88)% of total assets. A gap is
considered negative when interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or
repricing within a specified time period exceed the amount of interest rate
sensitive assets repricing or maturing within that same time period. A gap is
considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing
or repricing within a specified time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate
sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within that same time period. In a
rising rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would generally be
expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase
in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of its assets and thus a
decrease in the institution&#146;s net interest income, whereas an institution
with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience the opposite
results. Conversely, during a period of falling rates, a negative gap would tend
to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend
to adversely affect net interest income. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The economic environment continually presents uncertainties as
to future interest rate trends. The Asset/Liability Committee regularly monitors
the cumulative gap position, in addition to utilizing a model that projects net
interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates, in order to be
able to respond to changes in interest rates by adjusting the gap position. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -6-</I></FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning
assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 1999, which
are anticipated by the Bank, using certain assumptions based on historical
experience and other data available to management, to reprice or mature in each
of the future time periods shown. This table does not necessarily indicate the
impact of general interest rate movements on the Bank&#146;s net interest income
because actual repricing of various assets and liabilities is subject to
customer discretion and competitive and other pressures and, therefore, actual
experience may vary from that indicated. </FONT></P>

have been included.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>(3) Statement savings, N.O.W. and money market accounts have been
included in the &#147;Three Months or Less&#148; category. Passbook savings have
been included in the &#147;Over Five Years&#148; category. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis
presented. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar
maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to
changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of
assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest
rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market
interest rates. The table reflects the estimates of management as to periods to
repricing at particular points in time. Among the factors considered, management
monitors both current trends and its historical repricing experience with
respect to particular or similar products. For example, the Bank has a number of
deposit accounts, including passbook savings, N.O.W. accounts and money market
accounts which may be withdrawn at any time. The Bank, based on historical
experience, assumes that while all customers in these account categories could
withdraw their funds on any given day, they will not do so, even if the market
interest rates were to change. As a result, different assumptions may be used at
different points in time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Significant increases in the level of market interest rates also
may adversely affect the fair value of securities and other interest earning
assets. At December 31, 1999, $97,969,000 or 100% of the Company&#146;s
securities had fixed interest rates. Generally, the value of fixed rate
instruments fluctuates inversely with the changes in interest rates. As a
result, increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the market
value of interest earning assets which could adversely affect the Company&#146;s
results of operations if sold or, in the case of interest earning assets
classified as available for sale, the Company&#146;s stockholders&#146; equity
if retained. Increases in market interest rates also could affect the type
(fixed-rate or adjustable-rate) and amount of loans originated by the Company
and the average life of loans and securities, which can adversely impact the
yields earned on the Company&#146;s loans and securities. In periods of
decreasing interest rates, the average life of loans held by the Company may be
shortened to the extent increased prepayment activity occurs during such period
which, in turn, may result in the investing of funds from such prepayments in
lower yielding assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company&#146;s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by
management through the use of a quarterly interest rate risk analysis model
which evaluates (i) the potential change in the net interest income over the
succeeding four quarter period and (ii) the potential change in the fair market
value of the Company, the &#147;Net Economic Value of Equity of the
Company,&#148; which would result from an instantaneous and sustained interest
rate change of plus or minus 200 basis points, in 100 basis point increments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>As in the case of the gap table, certain shortcomings are
inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements.
Modeling potential changes in the net interest income and net economic value of
equity requires the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect
the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market
interest rates. In this regard, the model presented assumes that the composition
of the Company&#146;s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the
beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also
assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across
the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific
assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income models and
net economic value of equity measurements provide an indication of the
Company&#146;s interest rate exposure at a particular point in time, such
measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the
effect of changes in market interest rates on the Company&#146;s net interest
income and will differ from actual results. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Net interest income, the primary contributor to earnings,
represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expenses
on interest bearing liabilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The following table sets forth certain information relating to
the Bank&#146;s average consolidated statements of condition and reflects the
average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods
indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by
the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods
shown. Average balances are derived from daily average balances. Interest on
nonaccruing loans has been included only to the extent reflected in the
consolidated statements of income. However, the loan balances are included in
the average amounts outstanding. Loan fee income totaled $241,000 in 1999,
$322,000 in 1998, and $649,000 in 1997. For purposes of this table, the average
balances for investment in debt and equity securities exclude unrealized
appreciation/depreciation due to the application of SFAS No.115. </FONT></P>

attributed to a decrease in the volume of residential mortgages sold into the
secondary market. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Interest on investment in debt and equity securities increased
$1,006,000 or 24.0% over 1998. The increase resulted from an increase in average
investment in debt and equity securities from $70,994,000 in 1998 to $89,286,000
in 1999. The average yield on debt and equity securities decreased from 5.9% in
1998 to 5.8% in 1999. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Interest Expense.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Interest expense increased $157,000 to $6,135,000 in 1999 from
$5,978,000 in 1998. The increase of 2.6% in interest expense was caused by an
increase in average interest bearing liabilities of 15.1% from $164,592,000 in
1998 to $189,478,000 in 1999. The cost of average interest bearing liabilities
decreased to 3.2% during 1999 from 3.6% in 1998. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Provision for Loan Losses.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>The provision for loan losses decreased $5,000 in 1999 to
$420,000. The allowance for loan losses increased to $1,971,000 at December 31,
1999 as compared with $ 1,713,000 at December 31, 1998. As a percentage of
loans, the allowance was 1.15% at December 31, 1999 in comparison to 1.02% at
December 31, 1998. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Loans of approximately $4,810,000 at December 31, 1999, were
classified as potential problem loans. These are loans for which management has
information which indicated that the borrower may not be able to comply with the
present payment terms. These loans are subject to constant management attention
and their classification is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined
based on management&#146;s detailed analysis of classified loans, input from the
Bank&#146;s outside loan review consultants, past loss experience, current
economic conditions, delinquency trends and other pertinent factors. Additions
to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries,
are charged to the allowance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is
adequate. While management uses available information to recognize losses on
loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in
conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the
examination process, periodically review the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan
losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the
allowance based on their judgments from the information available to them at the
time of their examination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Other Income.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Other income decreased by $336,000 or 11.2% to $2,669,000 in
1999 compared to $3,005,000 in 1998. Service charges on deposit accounts for the
year ended December 31, 1999 totaled $980,000, an increase of $141,000 or 16.8%
over 1998. This increase primarily resulted from the Bank increasing fees
charged on certain deposit accounts during the second quarter of 1999. Net gains
on securities were $1,000 in 1999 compared to $47,000 in 1998. These gains
resulted primarily from sales of securities in accordance with the Bank&#146;s
investment strategies. Fees for other customer services for the year ended
December 31, 1999 totaled $1,033,000 an increase of $94,000 or 10.0% over 1998.
The increase is due to an increase in merchant processing fees resulting from a
change in the pricing structure made in the second quarter and an increase in
the volume of merchant sales during 1999. The increase was partially offset by a
decrease in fees collected on residential mortgage loans of $155,000 or 45.2% to
$188,000 in 1999 compared to $343,000 in 1998. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 1999
totaled $655,000, a decrease of $525,000 or 44.5% over the last year. The
decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in income from the gain on the sale
of mortgages of $521,000 or 57.4% to $386,000 in 1999 compared to $907,000 in
1998. Increased competition within the Bank&#146;s market has decreased the
return on residential mortgages; therefore the Bank decided to focus less
attention on these products. While revenue from mortgage banking operations was
down, corresponding expense reductions partially offset such decline. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Other Expenses.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Other expenses increased by $379,000 or 3.9% to $10,016,000 in
1999 from $9,637,000 in 1998. The components of this change included an increase
in furniture and fixture expense of $89,000 or 12.8%; an increase in salaries
and employee benefits of $61,000 or 1.3% which was in part due to a reduction in
the mortgage banking operations; and an increase in other operating expenses of
$216,000 or 6.4%. Increased furniture and fixture expense primarily resulted
from increased depreciation expenses relative to equipment upgrades in
preparation for Year 2000 readiness. The increase in other operating expenses is
primarily attributed to increased consulting and legal fees relative to the
formation of a subsidiary in the second quarter of 1999. It is the Bank&#146;s
intention to operate this subsidiary as a Real Estate Investment Trust. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -11-</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Provision for Income Taxes.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>The provision for income taxes increased to $2,387,000 for 1999
from $2,089,000 for 1998. This increase was due to income before income taxes
increasing from $5,984,000 in 1998 to $7,154,000 in 1999. The effective tax rate
for the year ended December 31, 1999 was 33% as compared to the prior year rate
of 35%. This reduction is primarily due to the implementation of the Bank&#146;s
tax planning strategies. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1997</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>General.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Net income for 1998 totaled $3,895,000, or $.91 per share, as
compared to net income of $4,195,000 or $.99 per share for the year ended
December 31, 1997. Net income increased 15.7%, compared to $3,366,000 or $.79
per share in 1997, excluding the gain on the sale of the Bank&#146;s former
headquarters building totaling $829,000 net of applicable taxes of $575,000.
Highlights include: (i) a $1,360,000 or 11.6% increase in net interest income;
(ii) a $1,318,000 or 30.5% decrease in total other income; and (iii) a $570,000
or 6.3% increase in total other expenses over the same period in 1997. The
provision for income taxes decreased $243,000 or 10.4%. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Net Interest Income.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Net interest income increased from $11,681,000 in 1997 to
$13,041,000 in 1998. The increase of 11.6% reflects an increase in average
earning assets from $204,891,000 in 1997 to $233,946,000 or 14.2% in 1998. The
net yield on average earning assets for 1998 decreased to 5.6% from 5.7% for
1997. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Interest Income.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Total interest income (including loan fee income of $322,000 in
1998 and $649,000 in 1997) increased from $17,224,000 in 1997 to $19,019,000 in
1998, an increase of 10.4%. The yield on average interest earning assets for
1998 decreased to 8.1% from 8.4% for 1997. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Interest income on loans (including fee income) increased
$2,061,000 during 1998 the result of an increase in average loans of 24.2% from
$125,780,000 in 1997 to $156,268,000 in 1998. The yield on average loans for
1998 decreased to 9.3% from 9.9% for 1997. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Interest on investment in debt and equity securities decreased
$283,000 or 6.7%. The decrease resulted from a decrease in average investment in
debt and equity securities from $73,004,000 in 1997 to $70,994,000 in 1998. In
addition, the average yield on debt and equity securities decreased from 6.1% in
1997 to 5.9% in 1998. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Interest Expense.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Interest expense increased $435,000 to $5,978,000 in 1998 from
$5,543,000 in 1997. The increase in interest expense was caused by an increase
in average interest bearing liabilities of 13.6% from $144,907,000 in 1997 to
$164,592,000 in 1998. The cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased
to 3.6% from 3.8% during 1998. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Provision for Loan Losses.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>The provision for loan losses increased $15,000 in 1998 to
$425,000. The allowance for loan losses increased to $1,713,000 at December 31,
1998 as compared with $ 1,393,000 at December 31, 1997. As a percentage of
loans, the allowance was 1.02% at December 31, 1998 in comparison to 1.01% at
December 31, 1997. A specific reserve was established in the third quarter of
the year primarily as a result of one loan relationship becoming nonperforming. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans (including
loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing) was 141.3% at December 31,
1998 compared to 142.6% at December 31, 1997. The allowance reflects
management&#146;s evaluation of classified loans, charge-off trends,
concentrations of credit and other pertinent factors. It also reflects input
from the Bank&#146;s outside loan review consultants. While management uses
available information in estimating possible loan losses, future additions to
the allowance may be necessary based on future changes in economic conditions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Other Income.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Other income decreased by $1,318,000 or 30.5% to $3,005,000 in
1998 compared to $4,323,000 in 1997. Other income increased $87,000 or 29.8% in
1998, excluding the gain on the sale of the Bank&#146;s former headquarters
building totaling $1,405,000. Income from mortgage banking activities for 1998
totaled $1,306,000, an increase of $81,000 or 6.6% over 1997. The Bank&#146;s
practice is to originate and sell these mortgages in the secondary market.
During 1998 the Bank reorganized mortgage banking operations into their
headquarters building. The Bank expects to continue to penetrate the mortgage
market, taking advantage of the low interest rate environment fueling the
refinance and construction loan market. Net gains on securities were $47,000 in
1998 compared to $106,000 in </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -12-</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>1997. Other operating income for the year ended December 31,
1998 totaled $813,000, an increase of $31,000 or 4.0% over the last year. This
change primarily results from a decrease in merchant processing fees resulting
from increased interchange costs that took effect in Spring 1998 partially
offset by increased fee income including new surcharges imposed on non-bank
customers&#146; transactions at automatic teller machines. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Other Expenses.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Other expenses increased by $570,000 or 6.3% to $9,637,000 in
1998 from $9,067,000 in 1997. The components of this change included an increase
in salaries and employee benefits of $175,000 or 3.8%; an increase in furniture
and fixture expense of $122,000 or 21.2%; and an increase in other operating
expenses of $243,000 or 7.7%. Increases in salaries and benefits in the current
year, partially attributed to increased staffing primarily at the new
Southampton Village branch opened in the fall of 1997, were partially offset by
reduction of staff in mortgage banking operations. Increased furniture and
fixture expense primarily results from increased depreciation expenses relative
to equipment upgrades in preparation for Year 2000 readiness. The increase in
other operating expenses primarily results from increased personnel education
costs from the development of training programs; increased advertising and
promotion expenses; increased data and item processing expenses to an out source
provider; and increased telephone costs attributable to improved data
communication lines between the Bank headquarters and the remote branches. These
expenses were partially offset by savings relative to servicing certain consumer
loans in house thereby eliminating an outside servicer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Provision for Income Taxes.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>The provision for income taxes decreased to $2,089,000 for 1998
from $2,332,000 for 1997. This decrease was due to income before income taxes
decreasing from $6,527,000 in 1997 to $5,984,000 in 1998. The decrease also
reflects the decrease in the effective tax rate to 35% in 1998 from 36% in 1997.
The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from a slight decline in the
effective state tax rate, net of the federal income tax benefit. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>LIQUIDITY</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the
availability of sufficient resources to meet all financial commitments.
Liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on
demand or contractual maturity, to repay other borrowings as they mature and to
make new loans and investments as opportunities arise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company&#146;s principal source of liquidity is dividends
from the Bank. Due to regulatory restrictions (see note 1k to the Consolidated
Financial Statements), dividends from the Bank to the Company at December 31,
1999 were limited to $7,620,000 which represents the Bank&#146;s 1999 retained
net income and the net undivided profits from the previous two years. The
dividends received from the Bank are used primarily for dividends to the
shareholders. In the event the Company subsequently expands its current
operations, in addition to dividends from the Bank, it will need to rely on its
own earnings, additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity
needs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company&#146;s most liquid assets are cash and cash
equivalents, securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due
within one year. The levels of these assets are dependent upon the
Company&#146;s operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any
given period. Other sources of liquidity include loan and security principal
repayments and maturities, lines of credit with other financial institutions,
the sale of securities from the available for sale portfolio, and growth in the
core deposit base. While scheduled loan amortization, maturing securities and
short term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit
flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates,
economic conditions and competition. The Bank adjusts its liquidity levels as
appropriate to meet funding needs such as deposit outflows, loans,
asset/liability objectives and suggested O.C.C. measurements such as loan to
capital ratios. At December 31, 1999, the Company had aggregate lines of credit
of $20,000,000 with correspondent banks to provide short term credit for
liquidity requirements. The Company also has the ability, as a member of the
Federal Home Loan Bank (&#147;FHLB&#148;) system, to borrow against its
unencumbered residential mortgages owned by the Bank. At December 31, 1999, the
Company had no such borrowings outstanding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company&#146;s liquidity positions are monitored daily to
ensure the maintenance of an optimum level and efficient use of available funds.
Management believes the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet its operating
requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>CAPITAL RESOURCES</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>As a result of undistributed net income, plus the change in net
unrealized depreciation in securities available for sale, net of tax, and the
issuance of common stock pursuant to the equity incentive plan, the
Company&#146;s stockholders&#146; equity increased to $23,672,000 at December
31, 1999 from $22,232,000 at December 31, 1998. The ratio of stockholders&#146;
equity to total assets decreased to 7.89% at year end 1999 from 8.33% at year
end 1998. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -13-</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The loan commitments outstanding as of December 31, 1999 totaled
approximately $50,880,000. The funding of such commitments is derived from the
primary sources of liquidity stated previously. See note 9b to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion of loan commitments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company exceeds the risk-based capital adequacy ratio levels
required by the regulatory agencies. Management believes that the current
capital levels along with future retained earnings will allow the Bank to
maintain a position exceeding required levels which will be more than adequate
to meet the growth of the Bank or any higher ratios required by the
discretionary authority of the regulators. The Company is prepared to issue
additional common stock should the need arise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company had return on average equity of 21.00%, 19.19%, and
23.08% and return on average assets of 1.59%, 1.51%, and 1.86% for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Return on average equity
and return on average assets in 1997 before the gain on the sale of assets,
chiefly the former headquarters, were 18.52% and 1.49%, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto
presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;), which require the measurements of
financial position and operating results in historical dollars without
considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due
to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of the
Company&#146;s operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all the assets
and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest
rates have a greater impact on the Company&#146;s performance than do the
effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move
in the same direction or, to the same extent, as the price of goods or services. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>IMPACT OF PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 &#147;Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148; (SFAS No. 133). This
Statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measure those instruments at fair value. The accounting for changes
in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of a derivative
and the resulting designation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In  June  1999,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  137  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and Hedging  Activities  - Deferral of the  Effective  Date of FASB
Statement  No.  133."  This  pronouncement  delayed  the  effective  date of the
provisions  of SFAS No. 133 to all fiscal  quarters  of fiscal  years  beginning
after June 15, 2000.  Management is in the process of determining the impact, if
any,  the  implementation  of SFAS No.  133 and 137 will  have on the  Company's
statements of income and condition.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>IMPACT OF THE YEAR 2000 ISSUE</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>To date no significant issues have arisen regarding the
Bank&#146;s transition into the new millennium. Upgrades of its branch and back
office systems to better serve its customers and improve the efficiency of its
operations were accelerated in 1999 as a result of the Year 2000 issue. The
total cost of these upgrades approximated $350,000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In addition to historical information, this filing includes
certain forward-looking statements based on current management expectations. The
Bank&#146;s actual results could differ materially from those management
expectations contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could
cause future results to vary from current management expectations include, but
are not limited to, general economic conditions, legislative and regulatory
changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, changes in tax
policies, rates and regulations of federal, state and local tax authorities,
changes in interest rates, deposit flows, the cost of funds, demand for loan
products, demand for financial services, competition, changes in the quality and
composition of the Bank&#146;s loan and investment portfolios, changes in
accounting principles, policies or guidelines, and other economic, competitive,
governmental and technological factors affecting the Bank&#146;s operations,
markets, products, services and prices. In addition, the Bank assumes no duty to
update forward-looking statements. </FONT></P>

<P><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997</p>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</font></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the Company) is chartered by the State of
New York as a one bank holding company. The Company&#146;s business currently
consists of the operations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Bridgehampton
National Bank (the Bank). The accounting and reporting policies of the Bank
conform to generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices
within the financial institution industry. The following is a description of the
more significant accounting policies that the Company follows in preparing its
Consolidated Financial Statements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>a) Basis of Financial Statement Presentation </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared
on the accrual basis of accounting and include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. All material intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management
is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities as of the date of each consolidated statement of
condition and the related consolidated statement of income for the year then
ended. Actual results could differ from those estimates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts
to conform to the current year presentation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>b) Cash and Cash Equivalents</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents
include cash on hand, amounts due from banks and federal funds sold which mature
overnight. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>c) Investment in Debt and Equity Securities</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(SFAS) No. 115 &#147;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities.&#148; Under SFAS No. 115, the Company is required to report
readily-marketable equity and debt securities in one of the following
categories: (i) &#147;held-to-maturity&#148; (management has a positive intent
and ability to hold to maturity) which are to be reported at amortized cost;
(ii) &#147;trading&#148; (held for current resale) which are to be reported at
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings; and (iii)
&#147;available for sale&#148; (all other debt and marketable equity securities)
which are to be reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
excluded from earnings and reported, net of tax, as a separate component of
stockholders&#146; equity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Included in investment securities are mortgage-backed securities
that represent participating interests in pools of long term mortgage loans
originated and serviced by the issuers of the securities and real estate
mortgage investment conduit (REMIC) certificates which represent beneficial
interests in a pool of mortgage-backed securities held in a trust. These
securities are carried at fair value. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Premiums and discounts on investment in debt and equity
securities are amortized to expense and accreted to income over the estimated
life of the respective securities using a method which approximates the level
yield method. Gains and losses on the sales of securities are recognized upon
realization based on the specific identification method. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>d) Loans and Loan Interest Income Recognition</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Loans are stated at the principal amount outstanding, net of
unearned income. Interest on loans is credited to income based on the principal
outstanding during the period. Loans that are 90 days past due are placed on a
nonaccrual basis. Exceptions to this policy are loans that are fully and
adequately secured and are in the process of collection. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or
estimated market value, determined on an aggregate basis. Mortgage loans are
primarily sold with the servicing released. Any retained servicing rights are
packaged and sold periodically. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -19-</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>All of the Bank&#146;s nonaccruing loans are considered impaired
under SFAS No. 114 &#147;Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.&#148;
In accordance with SFAS No. 114, a valuation allowance is established on
impaired loans to reflect the difference, if any, between face amount of the
loan and the present value of expected future cash flow discounted at the
loan&#146;s effective interest rate, or as a practical expedient, at the
loan&#146;s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>During 1998, the Bank began deferring nonrefundable loan
origination fees and amortizing these fees as yield adjustments over the life of
the related loans. In prior years loan origination costs and commitment fees
were recorded as income when received. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In 1999, the Bank began deferring the direct costs of loan
origination and amortizing these costs as yield adjustments over the life of the
related loans. In prior years direct loan costs were expensed as incurred. The
effect of these changes in accounting treatment were not considered material. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>e) Allowance for Loan Losses</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined
based on management&#146;s detailed analysis of classified loans, input from the
Bank&#146;s outside loan review consultants, past loss experience, current
economic conditions, delinquency trends and other pertinent factors. The
reserves are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine if any adjustments are
necessary. The information reviewed also includes past due trends, charge-off
trends, and concentrations of credit. Based on the loan classification
committee&#146;s review of the classified loans and the overall reserve levels
as they relate to the entire loan portfolio, management believes the allowance
for possible loan losses is adequate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>While management uses available information to recognize losses
on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in
conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the
examination process, periodically review the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan
losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the
allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the
time of their examination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>f) Banking Premises and Equipment</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Banking premises and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on banking premises and
equipment is computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets (50 years for buildings and 2 to 10 years for furniture and
fixtures). Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line method over
the terms of the related leases. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>g) Other Real Estate Owned</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Other real estate owned consists of real estate acquired by
foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and is recorded at the lower of the
net unpaid principal balance at the foreclosure date plus acquisition costs or
fair value. Subsequent valuation adjustments are made if fair value less
estimated costs to sell the property falls below the carrying amount. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>h) Income Taxes</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company follows SFAS No. 109, which requires an asset and
liability approach for accounting for income taxes. The asset and liability
approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that a future
benefit will be realized. It is management&#146;s position, as currently
supported by the facts and circumstances, that no valuation allowance is
necessary against any of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>i) Treasury Stock</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Repurchases of common stock are recorded as treasury stock at
cost. During 1999 all of the outstanding treasury stock has been retired. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -20-</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>j) Earnings Per Share</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>For the year ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, diluted
weighted average common stock and common stock equivalent shares outstanding for
the diluted earnings per share calculation were 4,277,079, 4,270,991 and
4,234,866, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
the total weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the
basic earnings per share calculation were 4,250,823, 4,229,307 and 4,223,703,
respectively. Diluted earnings per share, which reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if outstanding stock options were exercised and resulted in the
issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company, is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
and dilutive stock options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>k) Dividends</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Cash available for dividend distribution to shareholders of the
Company must initially come from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. The
approval of the Regional Administrator of National Banks is required if the
total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the
total of the Bank&#146;s net income of that year combined with its retained net
income of the preceding two years. The Bank had approximately $7,620,000
available as of December 31, 1999 which may be paid to the Company as a
dividend. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>l) Stock Splits</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>On July 20, 1998, the Board of Directors declared a
three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable August 31,
1998 to stockholders of record as of August 19, 1998. The stock split increased
outstanding common shares from 1,411,599 to 4,234,797. On April 15, 1997, the
Board of Directors declared a three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock
dividend payable May 30, 1997 to stockholders of record as of May 1, 1997. The
stock split increased outstanding common shares from 469,333 to 1,407,999.
Stockholders&#146; equity has been reclassified to give retroactive recognition
to the stock splits for all periods presented by reclassifying from undivided
profits and capital surplus to common stock the par value of additional shares
resulting from the stock splits. In addition, all references in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto to number of shares, per share amounts,
stock option data and market prices of the common stock have been restated
giving retroactive recognition to the stock splits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>m) Change in Par Value</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The equity section of the consolidated statements of condition
also reflects the decrease in the par value of the Company&#146;s Common Stock
from a par value of Five Dollars ($5.00) per share to a par value of One Cent
($0.01) per share. This change was authorized by the Board of Directors and
adopted by the Shareholders at the Company&#146;s April 19, 1999 annual meeting.
The change was effectuated during the second quarter of 1999 by filing an
amendment to the Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation. Such reduction in
par value permitted the Company to decrease its stated capital by approximately
$21,203,000. Capital surplus increased by approximately $21,203,000, thereby
providing the Company with the ability to allow payments of dividends from
surplus if deemed advisable or necessary by the Board of Directors. Capital
surplus has not been restated for prior periods. It should be realized, however,
that as a practical matter the Company would only have the ability to pay out a
moderate proportion of the aggregate increase in capital surplus as dividends
since there are regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements include
selected information as of December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995 and for the years

<P><FONT SIZE=3>o) Stock Based Compensation Plans</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>SFAS No. 123 &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,&#148; encourages, but does not require companies to record
compensation cost for stock-based compensation plans at fair value. The Company
continues to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value
method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
&#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>p) Comprehensive Income</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Comprehensive income includes net income and all other changes
in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and
distributions to owners. Other comprehensive income includes revenues, expenses,
gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are
included in comprehensive income but excluded from net income. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive income
are reported net of related income taxes. Accumulated other comprehensive income
for the Company consists solely of unrealized holding gains or losses on
available for sale securities. Such gains or losses are net of reclassification
adjustments for realized gains (losses) on sales of available for sale
securities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>q) New Accounting Pronouncements</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 &#147;Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148; (SFAS No. 133). This
Statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measures those instruments at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of a
derivative and the resulting designation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In June 1999, the FASB  issued SFAS No. 137 "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities  - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 133."  This pronouncement delayed the effective date of the
provisions of SFAS No. 133 to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000.  Management is in the process of determining the impact,
if any, the implementation of SFAS No. 133 and 137 will have on their
statements of income and condition.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3>The principal business of the Bank is lending, primarily in commercial
real estate loans, construction loan mortgages, home equity loans, land loans,
consumer loans, home advantage loans, residential mortgages and commercial
loans. The Bank considers its primary lending area as the five East End towns of
Suffolk County, New York. Since the primary lending area of the Bank is the two
forks of the eastern end of Long Island, the loan portfolio as a whole is
dependent on the economic conditions of the geographic market served by the
Bank. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Allowance for Loan Losses.</b></font><BR>
<FONT SIZE=3>Management uses criteria set forth by the regulatory agencies in
its classification and review of the loan portfolio which includes a general
allocation reserve for each loan type. Reserves are reviewed on a quarterly
basis to determine if any adjustments are necessary. The information reviewed
includes past due trends, charge-off trends, economic conditions and
concentrations of credit. The provisions for loan losses in 1999 was used to
maintain the allowance for loan losses to an adequate reserve level to support
the Bank&#146;s asset quality as well as to reflect the increase in loan growth
during the year. Based on the loan classification committee&#146;s review of the
classified loans and the overall reserve levels as they relate to the entire
loan portfolio, management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate.
However, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in
conditions. </FONT></P>

<p><FONT SIZE=3>b. Equity Incentive Plan</FONT></p>

<p><FONT SIZE=3>During 1996, an equity incentive plan was approved by the
stockholders to provide for the grant of options to purchase up to a total of
432,000 shares of common stock of the Company and for the award of shares of
common stock as a bonus. Such shares may be subject to restrictions based on
continued service or performance as employees of the Company or subsidiaries of
the Company. Options awarded under the plan are determined by the Incentive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company accounts for this
plan under APB Opinion No. 25, under which no compensation cost has been
recognized for stock options granted. Had compensation cost for these stock
options been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company&#146;s net
income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma
amounts: </FONT></P>

<p><FONT SIZE=3>c. Other</FONT></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>During 1999, the Bank was required to maintain certain cash
balances with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for reserve and clearing
requirements. These balances averaged $5,192,000 in 1999. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>During 1999, 1998, and 1997, the Bank maintained an overnight
line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. The Bank has the
ability to borrow against its unencumbered residential mortgages owned by the
Bank. There were no amounts outstanding at years ended December 31, 1999 and
1998. </FONT></P>

<p><FONT SIZE=2>10. ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</font></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time and
are based on existing on and off balance sheet financial instruments. Such
estimates are generally subjective in nature and dependent upon a number of
significant assumptions associated with each financial instrument or group of
financial instruments, including estimates of discount rates, risks associated
with specific financial instruments, estimates of future cash flows, and
relevant available market information. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the estimates. In addition, fair value estimates do not
reflect the value of anticipated future business, premiums or discounts that
could result from offering for sale at one time the Bank&#146;s entire holdings
of a particular financial instrument, or the tax consequences of realizing gains
or losses on the sale of financial instruments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The significant assumptions utilized by the Company in
estimating the fair value of its financial instruments are as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Cash and Cash Equivalents.</b><br>
For these short term instruments, the carrying amount is a
reasonable estimate of fair value. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Investment Securities.</b><br>
For investment securities, fair value is based on quoted market
prices. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Loans.</b><br>
Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar
financial characteristics. The total loan portfolio is first divided into
adjustable and fixed rate terms. Adjustable rate loans are then divided into
those that can reprice immediately with changes in interest rates and those that
are subject to repricing over time. Adjustable rate loans that reprice over time
and fixed rate loans are further segmented by type such as residential
mortgages, home equity loans, consumer loans, commercial mortgages, commercial
loans and land loans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Fair value is calculated by discounting anticipated future
repricing amounts or cash flows using discount rates equivalent to the rates at
which the Company would currently make loans which are similar with regard to
collateral, maturity and type of borrower. The discounted value of the repricing
amounts and cash flows is reduced by a credit risk adjustment based on internal
loan classifications. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Deposit Liabilities.</b><BR>
The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as
noninterest bearing demand deposits, money market accounts and savings accounts
is equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Time deposits

<p><FONT SIZE=2>11. REGULATORY MATTERS</font></p>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements
administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital
requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional
discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on the Bank&#146;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy
guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank
must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the
Bank&#146;s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated
under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank&#146;s capital amounts and
classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about
components, risk weightings, and other factors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure
capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set
forth in the table below) of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the
regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital (as
defined) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of December 31,
1999, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is
subject. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>As of December 31, 1999, the most recent notification from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation categorized the Bank as well capitalized
under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized
as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1
risk-based, Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. Since that
notification, there are no conditions or events that management believes have
changed the institution&#146;s category. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
condition of Bridge Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders&#146;
equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended
December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bridge
Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year
period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Certain directors and related parties, including their immediate

of the Bank during 1999, 1998 and 1997. Such loans were made in the ordinary
course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rate and
security, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other
persons, and do not represent more than normal risk of collection or present
other unfavorable features. The aggregate amount of these loans was
approximately $67,000, $201,000 and $256,000 at December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively. During 1999, no new loans to such persons were made and
repayments totaled $134,000. There were no loans to directors which were
nonaccruing at December 31, 1999, 1998 or 1997. </FONT></P>
