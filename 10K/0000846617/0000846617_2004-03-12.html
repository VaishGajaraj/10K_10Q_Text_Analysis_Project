<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the
&#147;Registrant&#148; or &#147;Company&#148;) is a registered bank holding company, the
sole subsidiary of which is The Bridgehampton National Bank (the &#147;Bank&#148;). The
Registrant was organized as a New York business corporation and incorporated under the
laws of the State of New York in 1988, at the direction of the Board of Directors of the
Bank for the purpose of becoming a bank holding company pursuant to a plan of
reorganization; under the plan the former shareholders of the Bank became the shareholders
of the Company. Since commencing business in March 1989, after the reorganization, the
Registrant has functioned primarily as the holder of all of the Bank&#146;s common stock.
In May 1999, the Bank established a real estate investment trust subsidiary, Bridgehampton
Community, Inc. (&#147;BCI&#148;). The assets transferred to BCI are viewed by the
regulators as part of the Bank&#146;s assets in consolidation. The establishment of BCI
provides an additional vehicle for access by the Company to the capital markets for future
investment purposes. In April 2002, the Bank capitalized a financial subsidiary,
Bridgehampton Abstract Holding, LLC. This subsidiary, through its majority investment in
Bridge Abstract, LLC, provides title insurance for the Bank. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>At present, the Registrant does not
own or lease any property and has no paid employees. The Registrant uses the Bank&#146;s
space and employees without separate payment. Headquarters are located at 2200 Montauk
Highway, PO Box 3005, Bridgehampton, New York 11932. The Bank&#146;s Internet address is
www.bridgenb.com. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Registrant is subject to the
regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Bank was established in 1910 as a national banking association. The
primary banking agency responsible for regulating the Bank is the Comptroller of the
Currency (the &#147;O.C.C.&#148;). The Bank also is subject to regulation and supervision
by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Additional
information on regulatory requirements is set forth in Note 11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Bank engages in full service
commercial and consumer banking and limited trust business, including accepting time and
demand deposits from the consumers, businesses and local municipalities surrounding its
branch offices. These deposits, together with funds generated from operations and
borrowings, are invested primarily in (1) mortgages, secured and unsecured commercial and
consumer loans; (2) FHLB, FNMA, and FHLMC mortgage-backed securities; (3) obligations of
New York State and local municipal obligations; and (4) U.S. treasury and government
agency securities. In addition, the Bank offers merchant credit and debit card processing,
automated teller machines, cash management services, online banking services, safe deposit
boxes and individual retirement accounts. Through its title insurance subsidiary the Bank
acts as a broker for title insurance services. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Bank employs 119 people on a
full-time and part-time basis. The Bank provides a variety of employment benefits and
considers its relationship with its employees to be positive. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>All phases of the Bank&#146;s
business are highly competitive. The Bank faces direct competition from a significant
number of financial institutions operating in its market area, many with a statewide or
regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence. Most of these competitors are
significantly larger than the Bank, and therefore have greater financial and marketing
resources than those of the Bank. The Bank considers its major competition to be local
commercial banks as well as other commercial banks with branches in the Bank&#146;s market
area. Other competitors include mortgage brokers and financial services firms other than
financial institutions such as investment and insurance companies. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Bank&#146;s market area is
located on eastern Long Island. Although the Bank does maintain some customer
relationships in Riverhead, Brookhaven and Shelter Island towns at this time, the majority
of its customer base and all of its existing branches are located in the towns of
Southampton, East Hampton, and Southold. Recently the Bank purchased real estate in the
Village of Westhampton Beach with the intent to open a branch office. Geographically this
location moves the Bank westward and demonstrates the commitment to traditional growth
through branch expansion. The Bank also purchased property to construct a new branch
facility in the Village of Southampton, and entered into a contract for the purchase of
property in the Town of East Hampton, conditioned on getting necessary approvals, and in
the Town of Southold. Obtaining approval through the local municipal planning authorities
is a lengthy process, but the Bank remains optimistic that the municipality will approve
its plans for construction in the Village of Southampton. In the Town of East Hampton, the
Bank is less certain of obtaining the municipality&#146;s approval because of building
moratoriums. </FONT></P>

<HR SIZE=5 COLOR=GRAY NOSHADE>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Eastern Long Island is semi-rural.
Surrounded by water and including the Hamptons, the region is a recreational destination
for the New York metropolitan and surrounding areas. Over the years the area&#146;s
economy benefited from the influx of tourists and second homeowners during the summer
months. In recent years, the local economy&#146;s fluctuations have become less seasonal
with a larger year round population during the winter months. Industries represented in
the marketplace are retail establishments; construction and trades; restaurants and bars;
lodging and recreation; professional entities; real estate; health services; and
agricultural and related businesses. During the last decade, the Long Island wine industry
has matured and currently there are approximately 27 vineyards located in the region. The
vast majority of businesses are considered small businesses employing fewer than ten
full-time employees. Key employers in the region include the municipalities, hospitals,
and financial institutions. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company, the Bank and its
subsidiaries, report their income on a consolidated basis using the accrual method of
accounting and are subject to federal and state income taxation. In general, banks are
subject to federal income tax in the same manner as other corporations. However, gains and
losses realized by banks from the sale of available for sale securities are generally
treated as ordinary, rather than capital, gains or losses. Additionally, the Company can
exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same
affiliated group. The Bank is subject to the New York State Franchise Tax on Banking
Corporations based on certain criteria. The taxation of net income is similar to federal
taxable income subject to certain modifications. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Bridgehampton National Bank is
chartered by and is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#147;O.C.C.&#148;). The Bank is a member
of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and its deposit accounts are insured up to
applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#147;FDIC&#148;). The
Bank also is a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank must file reports with the
OCC concerning its activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory
approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or
acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the OCC
to test the compliance with various regulatory requirements. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Bank is subject to various
statutory requirements and rules and regulations promulgated and enforced primarily by the
OCC and to a lesser extent the FDIC. These statutes, rules and regulations relate to
insurance of deposits, minimum capital requirements, allowable investments, lending
authority, mergers, consolidations, issuance of securities, payment of dividends,
establishment of branches and other aspects of our business. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>This regulation and supervision
establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank may engage and is
intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory
structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with
their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies
with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss
reserves. </FONT></P>

holding company controlling the Bank, is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,
as amended (&#147;BHCA&#148;), and the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board
under the BHCA applicable to bank holding companies. Bridge Bancorp is required to file
reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve
Board. Bridge Bancorp also files certain reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the federal securities laws. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>During 2003, although the net
interest margin was strong, net interest margin compression affected earnings growth as
operations continued in a historically low interest rate environment. The net interest
margin declined to 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 5.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2002. Prepayments on mortgage-backed securities and loans contributed to net
interest margin compression as these cash flows were reinvested at then current lower
market yields. </FONT></P>

<HR SIZE=5 COLOR=GRAY NOSHADE>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Structurally, the Bank&#146;s balance
sheet exhibits an asset sensitive bias over the long term. As a result, the Bank&#146;s
greatest exposure is to a sustained lower rate environment since asset yields would be
expected to decline further while deposit costs would stabilize. Should rates begin to
rise, margin compression is expected in the near term; however, management anticipates
that the balance sheet will benefit over time from a prolonged rising rate environment.
Going into 2004, it is anticipated that the Bank will be operating with a lower net
interest margin than prior years, putting continued pressure on earnings growth. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Management maintained the asset
quality on of its loan portfolio. To accomplish this objective the Company follows its
loan policies and underwriting practices, which include (i) granting loans on a sound and
collectible basis; (ii) understanding needs of the businesses and the community in the
Company&#146;s general market area while maintaining a balance between yield and risk;
(iii) ensuring that primary, secondary and tertiary sources of repayment are adequate in
relation to the amount of the loan; (iv) developing and maintaining adequate
diversification of the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each loan
category; (v) ensuring that each loan is properly documented; and (vi) developing and
applying adequate collection procedures. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Bank experienced strong growth in
its core business with increases in average net loans and deposits of 12.5% and 11.5%,
respectively, over December 31, 2002. Even though there was an increase in average
interest earning asset growth, the increased volume was more than offset by a decrease in
yields. Management is mindful of growth levels and the long-term effects of adding assets
to the balance sheet in this low rate environment. Loans are priced sensibly, and as the
rate environment shifts management is cognizant of potentially repositioning assets.
Management continues its strategy not to take undue risks by extending asset maturities or
to compromise credit quality to record higher yielding assets. Maintaining efficiency
remains a priority while continuing to grow markets and product offerings. Results were
achieved while maintaining an efficiency ratio of 46.28% for 2003. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>For the year ended December 31, 2003,
net gains from sales of securities available for sale totaled $826,000. Management sold
investment securities that were susceptible to increased prepayment risk in a continued
low rate environment. Additional securities were sold as part of ongoing investment
portfolio strategies. Mortgage-backed securities are sometimes sold when they pay down to
a certain level to mitigate increased price risk. Government securities are sometimes sold
to take advantage of changes in the yield curve. Cash flows from the investment and loan
portfolios, as well as deposit growth, were deployed into all categories of investment in
debt and equity securities. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Earnings growth has outpaced asset
growth over recent years adding to the importance of active capital management. During
2003, the Company re-approved its stock repurchase plan allowing the repurchase of up to
5% of its current outstanding shares. However, opportunities to buy back shares were not
available in 2003. As a result, despite steady increases in quarterly dividends, our
capital levels remained higher than projected. In addition to declaration of the regular
dividend in December 2003, the Company declared a special dividend of $0.40 per share.
Despite the payment of this special dividend, capital remains at a level sufficient to
support planned expansion and growth. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 contains a summary of our significant
accounting policies. Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are
inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective
assessments. Our policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance
for loan losses is our most critical accounting policy. This policy is important to the
presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and it involves a
higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective
judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters.
The use of different judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in material
differences in our results of operations or financial condition. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Following is a description of our

its application. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The allowance for loan losses is
established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred
losses inherent in the Bank&#146;s loan portfolio. Management evaluates the adequacy of
the allowance on a quarterly basis. The allowance is comprised of both individual
valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Bank monitors its entire loan
portfolio on a regular basis, with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified
loans, repayment patterns, probable incurred losses, past loss experience, current
economic conditions, and various types of concentrations of credit. Additions to the
allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged to
the allowance. </FONT></P>

<HR SIZE=5 COLOR=GRAY NOSHADE>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Individual valuation allowances are
established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process
including the procedures for impairment testing under Statement of Accounting Standard
(&#147;SFAS&#148;) No. 114, &#147;Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, an
Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 15,&#148; and SFAS No. 118, &#147;Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan &#151; Income Recognition and Disclosures, an Amendment
of FASB Statement No. 114.&#148; Such valuation, which includes a review of loans for
which full collectibility in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured,
considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell, if
any, or the present value of expected future cash flows, or the loan&#146;s observable
market value. Any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance
for the loan. Pursuant to our policy, loan losses must be charged-off in the period the
loans, or portions thereof, are deemed uncollectible. Assumptions and judgments by
management, in conjunction with outside sources, are used to determine whether full
collectibility of a loan is not reasonably assured. Assumptions and judgments also are
used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the
present value of expected future cash flows or the loan&#146;s observable market value.
Individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these
assumptions and judgments. Individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific
loans considered impaired. The results of the individual valuation allowances are
aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Loan pool valuation allowances
represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risks
associated with our lending activities, but which, unlike individual allowances, have not
been allocated to particular problem assets. Pool evaluations are broken down as follows:
First, loans with homogenous characteristics are pooled by loan type and include home
equity loans, residential mortgages, land loans and consumer loans. Then all remaining
loans are segregated into pools based upon the risk rating of each credit. Key factors in
determining a credit&#146;s risk rating include management&#146;s evaluation of: cash
flow, collateral, guarantor support, financial disclosures, and management. The
determination of the adequacy of the valuation allowance is a process that takes into
consideration a variety of factors. The Bank has developed a range of valuation allowances
necessary to adequately provide for probable incurred losses inherent in each pool of
loans. We consider our own charge-off history along with the growth in the portfolio as
well as the Bank&#146;s credit administration and asset management philosophies and
procedures when determining the allowances for each pool. In addition, we evaluate and
consider the impact that existing and projected economic and market conditions may have on
the portfolio as well as known and inherent risks in the portfolio. Finally, we evaluate
and consider the allowance ratios and coverage percentages of both peer group and
regulatory agency data. The ranges of loan pool valuation allowances developed by the Bank
are applied to the outstanding principal balance of the loans in each pool. These
evaluations are inherently subjective because, even though they are based on objective
data, it is management&#146;s interpretation of that data that determines the amount of
the appropriate allowance. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Classification Committee is
comprised of both members of management and the Board of Directors. The adequacy of the
reserves is analyzed quarterly, with any adjustment to a level deemed appropriate by the
Classification Committee, based on its risk assessment of the entire portfolio. Based on
the Classification Committee&#146;s review of the classified loans and the overall reserve
levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at December 31, 2003, management
believes the allowance for loan losses has been established and maintained at levels
adequate to reflect the probable incurred losses in the Bank&#146;s loan portfolio. Future
additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic,
market or other conditions. Changes in estimates could result in a material change in the
allowance. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the
examination process, periodically review the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses. Such
agencies may require the Bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their
judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Net interest income can be analyzed
in terms of the impact of changes in rates and volumes. The following table illustrates
the extent to which changes in interest rates and in volume of average interest earning
assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the Bank&#146;s interest income and
interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category
with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume
multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rates (changes in rates
multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net changes. For purposes of this table,
changes, which are not due solely to volume or rate changes, have been allocated to these
categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate. Due to
the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during the period analyzed, it is not
possible to precisely allocate changes between volume and rates. In addition, average
earning assets include nonaccrual loans. </FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Bank&#146;s loan portfolio
consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial and residential real estate
properties located in the Bank&#146;s principal lending area on eastern Long Island. The
interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such
loans, the supply of money available for lending purposes, the rates offered by its
competitors, the Bank&#146;s relationship with the customer and the related credit risks
of the transaction. These factors are affected by general and economic conditions,
including but not limited to monetary policies of the federal government, including the
Federal Reserve Board, legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>With respect to the underwriting of
loans, there are certain risks, including the risk of non-payment that is associated with
each type of loan that the Company markets. Risks associated with real estate loans
include concentrations of loans in a certain loan type such as commercial real estate and
fluctuating values of land and improved properties. The primary risks associated with
commercial loans are the experience and quality of the borrower&#146;s management, the
business climate, the cash flow of the business and the impact of economic factors. The
primary risks associated with consumer loans relate to the borrower, such as the risk of a
borrower&#146;s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions or the
amount and nature of a borrower&#146;s other existing indebtedness, and the value of the
collateral securing the loan if the Company must take possession of the collateral.
Consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of
loan. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company&#146;s policy for
charging off loans is a multi-step process. A loan is considered a potential charge-off
when it is in default of either principal or interest for a period of 90, 120 or 180 days,
depending upon the loan type, as of the end of the prior month. In addition to date
criteria, other triggering events may include, but are not limited to, notice of
bankruptcy, death of the borrower, and deficiency balance from the sale of collateral.
These loans identified are presented for evaluation at the regular meeting of the Credit
Committee. The recovery of charged-off balances is actively pursued until the potential
for recovery has been exhausted or until the expense of collection does not justify the
recovery efforts. </FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Overnight borrowings decreased
$6,400,000 to $5,900,000 from the prior year-end. The source of funds for the increase in
assets was derived primarily from increased deposits of $50,750,000 or 12.5%. The increase
in total deposits is a result of the Bank&#146;s continued business development efforts to
attract new accounts through the mature branches as well as the Bank&#146;s more recently
opened branches. Demand deposits increased $33,845,000 or 27.0%. Savings, N.O.W. and money
market deposits increased $11,831,000 or 5.4%. This increase is primarily attributed to
increased money market deposits both in public fund accounts and individual, partnership
and corporate accounts. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more increased $6,035,000
or 20.3% over December 31, 2002, while other time deposits decreased $961,000 or 2.9% over
the prior year. </FONT></P>

$42,794,000 at December 31, 2003, an increase of 7.1% over December 31, 2002. The increase
of $2,823,000 was the result of net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 of
$9,598,000; plus the proceeds, net of taxes, of $478,000 from the exercise of incentive
stock options pursuant to the equity incentive plan; plus $163,000 for the issuance of
vested stock awards from treasury; less cash dividends declared of $4,893,000; and plus
the net decrease in other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $2,523,000. Changes in
market conditions were the primary reason for the net decrease in unrealized depreciation
in securities available for sale, which decreased other comprehensive income. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The objective of liquidity management
is to ensure the sufficiency of funds available to respond to the needs of depositors and
borrowers, and to access unanticipated earnings enhancement opportunities for Company
growth. Liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on
demand or contractual maturity, to repay other borrowings as they mature and to make new
loans and investments as opportunities arise. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company&#146;s principal source
of liquidity is dividends from the Bank. Due to regulatory restrictions (see Note 1.l to
the Consolidated Financial Statements), dividends from the Bank to the Company at December
31, 2003 were limited to $13,136,000, which represents the Bank&#146;s 2003 retained net
income and the net undivided profits from the previous two years. The dividends received
from the Bank are used primarily for dividends to the shareholders. In the event that the
Company subsequently expands its current operations, in addition to dividends from the
Bank, it will need to rely on its own earnings, additional capital raised and other
borrowings to meet liquidity needs. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Bank&#146;s most liquid assets
are cash and cash equivalents, securities available for sale and securities held to
maturity due within one year. The levels of these assets are dependent upon the
Bank&#146;s operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given
period. Other sources of liquidity include loan and security principal repayments and
maturities, lines of credit with other financial institutions including the Federal Home
Loan Bank, and growth in core deposits. While scheduled loan amortization, maturing
securities and short-term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds,
deposit flows and loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced
by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank adjusts its
liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit outflows,
loans, and asset and liability management objectives. Historically, the Bank has relied on
its deposit base, drawn through its full-service branches that serve its market area, as
its principal source of funding. The Bank seeks to retain existing deposits and loans and
maintain customer relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates
to its customers, while managing the overall cost of funds needed to finance its
strategies. The Bank&#146;s Asset/Liability and Funds Management Policy allows for
wholesale borrowings of up to 15% of total assets. At December 31, 2003, the Bank had
aggregate lines of credit of $42,000,000 with unaffiliated correspondent banks to provide
short-term credit for liquidity requirements. Of these aggregate lines of credit,
$22,000,000 is available on an unsecured basis. The Bank also has the ability, as a member
of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#147;FHLB&#148;) system, to borrow against unencumbered
residential mortgages owned by the Bank. The Bank also has a master repurchase agreement
with the FHLB, which increases its borrowing capacity. In addition, the Bank has an
approved broker relationship for the purpose of issuing brokered certificates of deposit. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company&#146;s liquidity
positions are monitored daily to ensure the maintenance of an optimum level, and efficient
use, of available funds. Based on the objectives determined by the Asset and Liability
Committee, the Bank&#146;s liquidity levels may be affected by the use of short-term and
wholesale borrowings. The Asset and Liability Committee is comprised of members of senior
management and the Board. Excess short-term liquidity is invested in overnight federal
funds sold. Management believes the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet its operating
requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Consolidated Financial Statements
and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the
measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars
without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to
inflation. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected
in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the
assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result,
changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial
institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in
prices. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same
magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many
factors, which are beyond the control of the Company, including the influence of domestic
and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States
government and federal agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Bank. </FONT></P>

source of income, increased to $23,367,000 in 2003 from $21,996,000 in 2002. The increase

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Net interest margin compression
continued throughout 2003. The decrease in the net interest margin is principally an
outcome of the continued low interest rate environment, resulting in interest earning
assets repricing at historically low yields. Prepayment speeds on mortgage-backed
securities accelerated in 2003 causing a substantial increase in the amortization of
premiums and adversely affecting the yield. Amortization of premiums on mortgage-backed
securities totaled approximately $1,647,000, $668,000 and $150,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The yield on the average interest earning assets had decreased at a faster
rate than the decrease in the cost of average interest bearing liabilities resulting in a
negative impact on the net interest margin. Low levels of deposit costs had not fully
offset lower asset yields. Reinvestment of cash flows from prepayments on mortgage-backed
securities and loans at current market rates added to the shrinking net interest margin. </FONT></P>

December 31, 2002 were classified as potential problem loans, which represent 3.4% of
total loans. These are loans for which management has information that indicates the
borrower may not be able to comply with the present repayment terms. This was an increase
from 2001 of $4,135,000, which represented 1.9% of total loans. These loans are subject to
increased management attention and their classification is reviewed on at least a
quarterly basis. Management implemented an enhanced loan review analysis process during
2002, which assists in the early identification of problem loans. Due to the structure and
nature of the credits, management is confident that the likelihood of sustaining a
significant loss on these relationships is remote. </FONT></P>

accounts for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $2,024,000, an increase of $662,000

2002 totaled $1,280,000, an increase of $405,000 or 46.3% over 2001. This increase is
partially attributed to merchant processing income due to an increase in the volume of

increase in net occupancy expense of $107,000 or 10.4%; and an increase in furniture and
fixture expense of $91,000 or 10.3%. Increases in net occupancy, as well as furniture and
fixture expense, were partially attributed to the cost associated with the new branch
offices. This increase also is attributed to depreciation expense of management
information systems that were purchased during 2001 and the first quarter of 2002. Systems
were purchased partially due to the introduction of consumer Internet banking. Increased
advertising also attributed to this change as the Bank actively marketed its new branch
network and product offerings. </FONT></P>

a non-contributory pension plan, which covers all of the Bank&#146;s eligible employees.
See Note 7.a to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The pension expense is based upon a
standard set of assumptions: discount rate, salary scale and the expected return on

is recorded and a correct level of funding is maintained. Various factors were reviewed
including, but not limited to Moody&#146;s ratings, U.S. Treasury rates, and other trends. </FONT></P>

source is net interest income, which is affected by changes in the level of interest
rates, the relationship between rates, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset
prepayments, the level and composition of deposits and liabilities, and the credit quality
of earning assets. The Company&#146;s objectives in its asset and liability management are
to maintain a strong, stable net interest margin, to utilize its capital effectively
without taking undue risks, to maintain adequate liquidity, and to reduce vulnerability of
its operations to changes in interest rates. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company&#146;s Asset and
Liability Committee meets periodically, but at least four times a year, to evaluate the
impact of changes in market interest rates on assets and liabilities, net interest margin,
capital and liquidity. Risk assessments are governed by policies and limits established by
senior management, which are reviewed and approved by the full Board of Directors at least
annually. The economic environment continually presents uncertainties as to future
interest rate trends. The Asset and Liability Committee regularly utilizes a model that
projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates, in order to
be able to respond to changes in interest rates. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Significant increases in the level of
market interest rates may adversely affect the fair value of securities and other interest
earning assets. At December 31, 2003, $207,569,000 or 99.0% of the Company&#146;s
securities had fixed interest rates. Generally, the value of fixed rate instruments
fluctuates inversely with the changes in interest rates. As a result, increases in
interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest earning assets,
which could adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations if sold or, in the
case of interest earning assets classified as available for sale, the Company&#146;s
stockholders&#146; equity if retained. Increases in market interest rates also could
affect the type (fixed-rate or adjustable-rate) and amount of loans originated by the
Company and the average life of loans and securities, which can impact the yields earned
on the Company&#146;s loans and securities. In periods of decreasing interest rates, the
average life of loans held by the Company may be shortened to the extent increased
prepayment activity occurs during such periods which, in turn, may result in the
investment of funds from such prepayments in lower yielding assets. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company utilizes the results of a
detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure to net interest
income to sustained interest rate changes. Management routinely monitors simulated net
interest income sensitivity over a rolling two-year horizon. The simulation model captures
the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and the interest
expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the Company&#146;s Statement of
Condition. This sensitivity analysis is compared to the asset and liability policy limits
that specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one-year
horizon given both a 200 basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates. Because
of the current historically low rate environment, the simulation modeled was a 100 basis
point shift downward at December 31, 2003. A parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a
twelve-month period is assumed. The following reflects the Company&#146;s net interest
income sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The preceding sensitivity analysis
does not represent a Company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of
expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous
assumptions including, but not limited to, the nature and timing of interest rate levels
and yield curve shapes, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing
decisions on loans and deposits, and reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability
cash flows. While assumptions are developed based upon perceived current economic and

of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets, the potential effect of
changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans, depositor early
withdrawals and product preference changes and other internal and external variables.
Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take
in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates and market conditions. </FONT></P>

in Bridge Abstract, LLC. The accounting and reporting policies of the Bank conform to
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general
practices within the financial institution industry. The following is a description of the
significant accounting policies that the Company follows in preparing its Consolidated
Financial Statements. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>a) Basis of Financial
Statement Presentation </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting and include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. All material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The preparation of financial
statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of each consolidated statement of condition and the related
consolidated statement of income for the years then ended. Future results could differ
from those estimates. The allowance for loan losses, fair values of financial instruments,
stock options, deferred taxes, and pension are particularly subject to change. </FONT></P>

<A NAME=A071></A>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>b) Cash and Cash
Equivalents </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>For purposes of reporting cash flows,
cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks and federal funds
sold, which mature overnight. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<A NAME=A072></A>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>c) Securities </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company is required to report
readily-marketable equity and debt securities in one of the following categories: (i)
&#147;held-to-maturity&#148; (management has a positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity), which are to be reported at amortized cost; (ii) &#147;trading&#148; (held for
current resale), which are to be reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
included in earnings; and (iii) &#147;available for sale&#148; (all other debt and
marketable equity securities), which are to be reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses reported net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income, a
separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Premiums and discounts on investment
in debt and equity securities are amortized to expense and accreted to income over the
estimated life of the respective securities using the interest method. Gains and losses on
the sales of securities are recognized upon realization based on the specific
identification method. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<A NAME=A073></A>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>d) Loans and Loan
Interest Income Recognition </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Loans are stated at the principal
amount outstanding, less net deferred origination and commitment fees. Loan origination
and commitment fees and certain direct costs incurred in connection with loan originations
are deferred and amortized to income over the life of the related loans as an adjustment
to yield. When a loan prepays, the remaining unamortized balance is recognized in the
current year. Interest on loans is credited to income based on the principal outstanding
during the period. Loans that are 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<A NAME=A074></A>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>e) Allowance for Loan
Losses </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Bank monitors its portfolio on a
regular basis, with consideration given to detailed analysis of probable incurred losses,
classified loans, delinquency trends, past loss experience, current economic conditions,
concentrations of credit, risk rating analyses; input from the Bank&#146;s outside loan
review consultants and regulatory agencies, and other pertinent factors. Increases to the
allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged to
the allowance. Based on the determination of management and the Classification Committee
of the condition of the portfolio, the overall level of reserves is periodically adjusted
to account for the inherent and specific risks within the entire portfolio. The adequacy
of the reserves is analyzed quarterly, with any adjustment to a level deemed appropriate
by management, based on its risk assessment of the entire portfolio. Based on the
Classification Committee&#146;s review of the classified loans and the overall reserve
levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at the quarter ended December 31, 2003,
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate. </FONT></P>

<HR SIZE=5 COLOR=GRAY NOSHADE>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Interest income on mortgage and
commercial loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90-days delinquent, unless the
loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically
charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual
or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered
doubtful. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>While management uses available
information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be
necessary based on changes in conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an
integral part of the examination process, periodically review the Bank&#146;s allowance
for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to, or
charge-offs against, the allowance based on their judgment about information available to
them at the time of their examination. </FONT></P>

Equipment </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Buildings, furniture and fixtures and
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings and related
components are depreciated using the straight-line method using a useful life of fifty
years for buildings and a range of two to ten years for equipment, furniture and fixtures.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the
service lives of the improvements whichever is shorter. Land is recorded at cost. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Improvements and major repairs are
capitalized, while the cost of ordinary maintenance, repairs and minor improvements is
charged to operations. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<A NAME=A076></A>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>g) Other Real Estate Owned </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Other real estate owned consists of
real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and is recorded at the
lower of the net unpaid principal balance at the foreclosure date plus acquisition costs
or fair value. Subsequent valuation adjustments are made if fair value less estimated
costs to sell the property falls below the carrying amount. At December 31, 2003 and 2002,
the Company carried no other real estate owned. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<A NAME=A077></A>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>h) Loan Commitments and
Related Financial Instruments </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Financial instruments include
off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial
letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these
items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability
to repay. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<A NAME=A078></A>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>i) Income Taxes </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company follows the asset and
liability approach, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates.
Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that a future benefit
will be realized. It is management&#146;s position, as currently supported by the facts
and circumstances, that no valuation allowance is necessary against any of the
Company&#146;s deferred tax assets. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>j) Treasury Stock </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Repurchases of common stock are
recorded as treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock is reissued using the first in, first
out method. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<A NAME=A080></A>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>k) Earnings Per Share </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Diluted earnings per share, which
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options were
exercised and if stock awards were fully vested and resulted in the issuance of common
stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company, is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares and common stock equivalents. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<A NAME=A081></A>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>l) Dividends </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Cash available for dividend
distribution to shareholders of the Company must initially come from dividends paid by the
Bank to the Company. The approval of the Regional Administrator of National Banks is
required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds
the total of the Bank&#146;s net income of that year combined with its retained net income
of the preceding two years. The Bank had approximately $13,136,000 available as of
December 31, 2003, which may be paid to the Company as a dividend. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>m) Segment Reporting </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>While management monitors the revenue
streams of the various products and services, the identifiable segments are not material
and operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis.
Accordingly, all of the financial service operations are considered by management to be
aggregated in one reportable operating segment. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>n) Stock Based
Compensation Plans </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Employee compensation expense under
stock options is reported using the intrinsic value method. No stock-based compensation
cost is reflected in net income, as all the options granted had an exercise price equal to
the market price of the underlying common stock at date of grant. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if expense was measured using
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.&#148; </FONT></P>

are included in comprehensive income but excluded from net income. Comprehensive income
and accumulated other comprehensive income are reported net of related income taxes.
Accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company includes unrealized holding gains
or losses on available for sale securities and the minimum pension liability. Such gains
or losses are net of reclassification adjustments for realized gains (losses) on sales of
available for sale securities. </FONT></P>

Standards </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>During 2003, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 149, &#147;Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,&#148; SFAS No. 150, &#147;Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equities,&#148; SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003),
&#147;Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,&#148; and
FIN No. 45, &#147;Guarantor&#146;s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees.&#148; Adoption of these new standards did not materially affect the
Company&#146;s operating results or financial condition. FIN No. 46, &#147;Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities&#148; currently is not applicable to the Company. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>SFAS No. 149 indicates that
commitments to make mortgage loans should be accounted for as derivatives if the loans are
to be held for sale, because the commitment represents a written option and accordingly is
recorded at the fair value of the option liability. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>SFAS No. 150 requires reporting

covers guarantees such as standby letters of credit, performance guarantees, and direct or
indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others, but not guarantees of funding. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>FIN No. 46, as revised in December
2003, changes the accounting model for consolidation from one based on consideration of
control through voting interests. Whether to consolidate an entity will now also consider
whether that entity has sufficient equity at risk to enable it to operate without
additional financial support, whether the equity owners in that entity lack the obligation
to absorb expected losses or the right to receive residual returns of the entity, or
whether voting rights in the entity are not proportionate to the equity interest and
substantially all the entity&#146;s activities are conducted for an investor with few
voting rights. </FONT></P>

threshold of $500,000,000 in average assets, the tax basis in the bad debt reserve prior
to January 1, 2003 is to be recaptured for federal tax purposes. The Bank intends to
recapture this using the deferral method and has previously provided for the taxes
relating to this recapture. Subsequent to January 1, 2003, the Bank is on a specific

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>During 2001, the Bank adopted the
Bridgehampton National Bank Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (&#147;SERP&#148;). The
SERP provides benefits to certain employees, designated by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors, whose benefits under the Pension Plan are limited by the
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The benefit under the SERP is equal to
the additional amount the employee would be entitled to under the Pension Plan in the
absence of such Internal Revenue Code limitations.The assets of the SERP are held in a
rabbi trust in order to maintain the tax-deferred status of the individuals in the plan.As
a result, the assets of the trust are reflected on the Consolidated Statements of
Condition of the Company. The effective date of the SERP was January 1, 2001. SERP expense
was $142,000, $107,000, and $97,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. </FONT></P>

approximately 50% of the total portfolio. The System&#146;s investment objective is to
exceed the investment benchmarks in each asset category. Each firm operates under a
separate written investment policy approved by the Trustees and designed to achieve an
allocation approximating 60% invested in Equity Securities and 40% invested in Debt
Securities. </FONT></P>

maintain certain cash balances with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for reserve and

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Bank
maintained an overnight line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York
(&#147;FHLB&#148;). The Bank has the ability to borrow against its unencumbered
residential mortgages and investment securities owned by the Bank. There were no amounts
outstanding at December 31, 2003 and $8,000,000 in FHLB loans and $4,300,000 in federal
funds purchased were outstanding as overnight borrowings at December 31, 2002. At December
31, 2003, the Bank had aggregate lines of credit of $42,000,000 with unaffiliated
correspondent banks to provide short-term credit for liquidity requirements. Of these
aggregate lines of credit, $22,000,000 is available on an unsecured basis; as of December
31, 2003, the Bank had $5,900,000 in such borrowings outstanding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In March 2001, the Bank entered into
a Master Repurchase Agreement with the FHLB whereby the FHLB agrees to purchase securities
from the Bank, upon the Bank&#146;s request, with the simultaneous agreement to sell the
same or similar securities back to the Bank at a future date. Securities are limited,
under the agreement, to government securities, securities issued, guaranteed or
collateralized by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. Government or any government
sponsored enterprise, and non-Agency AA and AAA rated mortgage-backed securities. At
December 31, 2003, there was $25,446,000 available for transactions under this agreement.
There were no balances outstanding at year-end. </FONT></P>

          ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Fair value estimates are made at a
specific point in time and are based on existing on and off balance sheet financial
instruments. Such estimates are generally subjective in nature and dependent upon a number
of significant assumptions associated with each financial instrument or group of financial
instruments, including estimates of discount rates, risks associated with specific
financial instruments, estimates of future cash flows, and relevant available market
information. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. In addition,
fair value estimates do not reflect the value of anticipated future business, premiums or
discounts that could result from offering for sale at one time the Bank&#146;s entire
holdings of a particular financial instrument, or the tax consequences of realizing gains
or losses on the sale of financial instruments. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Cash and Due from Banks and Federal
Funds Sold: Carrying amounts approximate fair value, since these instruments are either
payable on demand or have short-term maturities. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Securities Available for Sale and
Held to Maturity: The estimated fair values are based on independent dealer quotations and
quoted market prices. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Loans: The estimated fair values of
real estate mortgage loans and other loans receivable are based on discounted cash flow
calculations that apply available market benchmarks when establishing discount factors for
the types of loans. All nonaccrual loans are carried at their current fair value. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Deposits: The estimated fair value of
certificates of deposits are based on discounted cash flow calculations that apply
interest rates currently being offered by the Bank for deposits with similar remaining
maturities to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities. Stated value is fair
value for all other deposits. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Borrowings: The estimated fair value
of borrowed funds is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows using
interest rates currently in effect for borrowings with similar maturities and collateral
requirements. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->

          REGULATORY MATTERS </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company and the Bank are subject
to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.
Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly
additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on the Company&#146;s and the Bank&#146;s financial statements. Under
capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the
Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative
measures of the Company&#146;s and Bank&#146;s assets, liabilities, and certain
off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The
Company&#146;s and Bank&#146;s capital amounts and classification also are subject to
qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other
factors. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Quantitative measures established by
regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum
amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total and Tier 1 capital (as
defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital
(as defined) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of December 31, 2003,
