<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>                       DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE</FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Portions of the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held April 15, 2002,  dated March 8, 2002, are
incorporated by reference into Part III.</FONT></P>

<P><I><B>Item 1. Business</B></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the
&#147;Registrant&#148; or &#147;Company&#148;) is a registered bank holding
company, the sole subsidiary of which is The Bridgehampton National Bank (the
&#147;Bank&#148;). The Registrant was organized as a New York business
corporation and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1988, at
the direction of the Board of Directors of the Bank for the purpose of becoming
a bank holding company pursuant to a plan of reorganization; under the plan the
former stockholders of the Bank became the stockholders of the Company. Since
commencing business in March 1989, after the reorganization, the Registrant has
functioned primarily as the holder of all of the Bank&#146;s common stock. In
May 1999, the Bank established a real estate investment trust subsidiary,
Bridgehampton Community, Inc. (&#147;BCI&#148;). The assets transferred to BCI
are viewed by the regulators as part of the Bank&#146;s assets in consolidation.
The establishment of BCI provides an additional vehicle for access by the
Company to the capital markets for future investment purposes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>At present, the Registrant does not own or lease any property and has no paid employees.  The Registrant uses the Bank's space and
employees without separate payment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank was established in
1910 as a national banking association and is under the supervision of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#147;O.C.C.&#148;). Its
headquarters are located at 2200 Montauk Highway, Bridgehampton, New York 11932. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank, a
community-oriented financial institution, engages in full service commercial and
consumer banking and limited trust business, including accepting time and demand
deposits from the areas surrounding its branch offices. These deposits, together
with funds generated from operations and borrowings, are invested primarily in
(1) commercial real estate loans, secured and unsecured commercial loans, and
consumer loans such as home equity loans and residential mortgages; (2) mortgage
loan surrogates such as mortgage backed securities; (3) obligations of New York
State and local political subdivisions; and (4) U.S. government agency and
treasury securities. To a lesser extent, the Bank originates certain other
loans, such as auto, personal, home improvement, commercial construction and
S.B.A. guaranteed loans. In addition, the Bank offers merchant credit and
debit card processing, wealth management services, automated teller machines,
cash management services, online banking services, safe deposit boxes and
individual retirement accounts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>As part of the
Company&#146;s strategy to find ways to best utilize its available capital,
during 2001 the Company instituted a stock repurchase program repurchasing
65,590 shares of its common stock under the plan. In January 2001, prior to
instituting the stock repurchase plan, the Company repurchased 5,000 shares of
its common stock, bringing the total number of treasury shares, at December 31,
2001 to 91,333 and the total number of outstanding common shares to 4,166,264.
At December 31, 2001, 145,040 shares remain to be repurchased under the current
stock repurchase program. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank employs 118 people on a full-time and part-time basis.  The Bank provides a variety of employment benefits and considers
its relationship with its employees to be positive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>All phases of the
Bank&#146;s business are highly competitive. The Bank faces direct competition
from a significant number of financial institutions operating in its market
area, many with a state-wide or regional presence, and in some cases, a national
presence. Most of these competitors are significantly larger than the Bank, and
therefore have greater financial and marketing resources than those of the Bank.
The Bank considers its major competition to be local commercial banks as well as
other commercial banks with branches in the Bank&#146;s market area. The
Bank&#146;s market is primarily the trade areas of the North and South Forks of
Eastern Suffolk County, with concentrations in the Bridgehampton, East Hampton,
Greenport, Mattituck, Montauk, Sag Harbor, Southampton, and Southold, New York
areas. In December 2001 the Bank received approval from its regulator to open a
branch in Hampton Bays, New York. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Company is subject to
the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The primary banking agency responsible for regulating
the Bank is the Comptroller of the Currency. The Bank is also subject to
regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Financial Modernization
Legislation: In November 1999, financial modernization legislation, entitled the
Gramm Leach Bliley Act (&#147;GLBA&#148;), was enacted that eliminated certain
legal barriers separating the conduct of various types of financial services
businesses, such as commercial banking, investment banking and insurance. In
addition, GLBA substantially revamped the regulatory scheme </FONT></P>



<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -1-</I></FONT></P>
<HR SIZE=5 NOSHADE>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>within which financial
institutions such as the Bank operate. While certain provisions of GLBA became
effective upon enactment, many major provisions did not become effective until
May 2001. As a result, while certain of the provisions of GLBA are expected to
affect operations, the overall impact of GLBA on the Bank cannot be predicted at
this time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Under GLBA, subject to
certain conditions imposed by the OCC, national banks will be permitted to form
&#147;financial subsidiaries&#148; that may conduct financial or incidental
activities, thereby permitting these subsidiaries to engage in certain
activities that were previously impermissible. In order to insulate the parent
bank from the risk of these new financial activities, GLBA imposes several
safeguards and restrictions on financial subsidiaries, including that the
Bank&#146;s equity investment in any financial subsidiary must be deducted from
the Bank&#146;s assets and tangible equity for purposes of calculating the
Bank&#146;s capital adequacy. In addition, GLBA imposes new restrictions on
transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries similar to
restrictions currently applicable to transactions between banks and their
nonbank affiliates. During 2001, the Bank received regulatory approval to
organize a financial subsidiary to be a joint venture partner in a title
insurance agency. The Bank&#146;s investment in such financial subsidiary is not
expected to be more than $100,000 in 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><I><B>Item 2.  Properties</B></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Facilities of the Registrant are located at 2200 Montauk Highway, Bridgehampton, New York in the Bank's Main Office building.  As
such, the Registrant itself has no physical properties.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank&#146;s Main Office
is owned in fee. The Bank also owns the building which houses its Southold
Branch located at 54790 Main Road, Southold, New York. The Bank leases eight
additional properties as branch locations at 425 County Road 39A, Southampton,
New York; 26 Park Place, East Hampton, New York; Mattituck Plaza, Main Road,
Mattituck, New York; 218 Front Street, Greenport, New York; 94 Main Street,
Southampton, New York; 2 Bay Street, Sag Harbor, New York; Montauk Highway,
Hampton Bays, New York; and 1 The Plaza, Montauk, New York. The Bank leases
additional space at 184 Old Country Road, Riverhead, New York formerly used as a
residential mortgage center. The Bank is currently subletting this space. </FONT></P>

<P><I><B>Item 3.  Legal Proceedings</B></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank, two present
executive officers and one former executive officer, have been named as
defendants in a lawsuit that was filed on February 18, 1999 by two former
employees in Suffolk County Supreme Court. The plaintiffs assert causes of
action in connection with their employment, conduct of loan and banking
transactions, and subsequent termination or resignation. The plaintiffs seek
compensatory and punitive damages. In the opinion of management at the present
time, after consultation with legal counsel, the lawsuit is without merit and
the ultimate outcome of this matter is not expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations, business operations or
consolidated financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P><I><B>Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders</B></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>No matters were submitted
to a vote of the shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>(2) On June 17, 1997, the
Bank sold its former headquarters building resulting in a gain, net of taxes, of
approximately $829,000. Return on average equity excluding this gain, net of
taxes, was 18.52%. Return on average assets excluding this gain, net of taxes,
was 1.49%. On December 15, 1997 the Bank declared a one time special dividend of
approximately $845,000, or $.20 per share, paying out this gain to the
shareholders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>(3) On July 20, 1998, the
Board of Directors declared a three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock
dividend payable August 31, 1998, to stockholders of record as of August 19,
1998. As a result, $14,439,990 was transferred from Undivided Profits and
Capital Surplus at August 19, 1998 to reflect the issuance. On April 15, 1997,
the Board of Directors declared a three-for-one stock split in the form of a
stock dividend payable on May 30, 1997 to stockholders of record as of May 1,
1997. As a result, $4,801,000 was transferred from Undivided Profits and Capital

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>(4) The equity section of
the balance sheet also reflects the decrease in the par value of the
Company&#146;s Common Stock from a par value of Five Dollars ($5.00) per share
to a par value of One Cent ($0.01) per share. This change was authorized by the
Board of Directors and adopted by the Shareholders at the Company&#146;s April
19, 1999 annual meeting. The change was effectuated during the second quarter of
1999 by filing an amendment to the Company&#146;s certificate of incorporation.
Such reduction in par value permitted the Company to decrease its stated capital
by approximately $21,203,000. Capital surplus increased by approximately
$21,203,000, thereby providing the Company with the ability to allow payments of
dividends from surplus if deemed advisable or necessary by the Board of
Directors. Capital surplus has not been restated for prior periods. It should be
realized, however, that as a practical matter the Company would only have the
ability to pay out a moderate proportion of the aggregate increase in capital
surplus as dividends since there are regulatory restrictions on the payment of
dividends. </FONT></P>

<P><I><B>Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</B></I></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>GENERAL</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Bridge Bancorp, Inc.
(&#147;the Company&#148;), a New York corporation, is a one-bank holding company
formed effective March 31, 1989, and on a parent only basis, had minimal results
of operations for 2001, 2000 and 1999. In the event the Company subsequently
expands its current operations, it will be dependent on dividends from its
wholly-owned subsidiary, The Bridgehampton National Bank (&#147;the Bank&#148;),
its own earnings, additional capital raised and borrowings as sources of funds.
The information below reflects principally the financial condition and results
of operations of the Bank. The Bank&#146;s results of operations are primarily
dependent on its net interest income, which is mainly the difference between
interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and
borrowings. Interest income on loans and investments is a function of the
average balances outstanding and the average rates earned during a period.
Interest expense is a function of the average amount of interest bearing
deposits and the average rates paid on such deposits during a period. The Bank
also generates other income, such as fee income on deposit accounts and merchant
credit and debit card processing programs, and net gains and losses on sales of
securities and loans. The Bank&#146;s net income is further affected by the
level of its other expenses, such as employees&#146; salaries and benefits,
occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses and
income tax expense. This discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the notes
thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this filing.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts, and the related
discussion and analysis, to conform to the current year presentation. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>FINANCIAL CONDITION</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The assets of the Company
totaled $393,424,000 at December 31, 2001, an increase of $38,782,000 or 10.9%
from the previous year end. This increase mainly results from an increase in
cash and cash equivalents of $8,319,000 or 51.9%, an increase in debt and equity
securities of $16,410,000 or 12.9%, and an increase in gross loans of
$14,270,000 or 7.1%. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Total loans grew
$14,270,000 or 7.1% since fiscal year end 2000. Average loans grew by
$28,780,000 or 15.8% when compared to the prior year. Each component of the
loan portfolio contributed to the growth; however, real estate loans increased
$15,106,000 or 9.1% while all other loans decreased $880,000 or 2.5% since
December 31, 2000. Growth in real estate loans is partially attributed to a
change in holding strategy whereby originated residential mortgages are held in
portfolio instead of being sold on the secondary market; a marketing campaign
promoting equity loans; and increased business development resulting from branch
expansion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The performance of the loan
portfolio continued to be strong for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001.
Since December 31, 2000 non-performing loans decreased 44.6% from $769,000 to
$532,000, representing 0.25 % of loans, net, at December 31, 2001. The Company
had no foreclosed real estate at 12/31/01. Total non-performing assets
represented 0.14% of total assets at the corresponding date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Total investment securities
increased from $126,851,000 at December 31, 2000 to $143,261,000 at December 31,
2001. The available for sale investment portfolio increased 9.8% to $125,709,000
primarily as a result of increased holdings of mortgage backed securities.
Securities held as available for sale may be sold in response to, or in
anticipation of, changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or
other factors. During the first quarter of 2001, management sold municipal
securities in the available for sale investment portfolio and reinvested these
funds in mortgage backed securities earning higher market rates of return.
Average mortgage backed securities grew by $20,966,000 or 35.6% when compared to
the prior year. This increase is partially due to deposit growth outpacing loan
growth and the repositioning of the investment portfolio. Investing in mortgage
backed securities generally provides stable cash flows, which may be reinvested
at current market rates. The weighted average life of the mortgage backed
securities portfolio was 2.97 years at December 31, 2001. </FONT></P>

<HR SIZE=5 NOSHADE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The source of funds for the
increase in assets was derived from increased deposits of $43,776,000 or 14.0%.
The increase in deposits is offset by a decrease in overnight borrowings of
$9,700,000 or 100% from the prior year-end. Demand deposits increased
$15,087,000 or 15.1%. This increase is attributed to growth in deposits
associated with business development efforts in new and existing markets.
Savings, N.O.W. and money market deposits increased $25,357,000 or 16.0%. This
increase is primarily attributed to increased money market deposits both in
public fund accounts and individual, partnership and corporate accounts.
Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more and other time deposits increased
$3,332,000 or 6.1% over December 31, 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Total stockholders&#146;
equity was $32,861,000 at December 31, 2001, an increase of 14.2% over December
31, 2000. The increase of $4,073,000 was the result of net income for the year
ended December 31, 2001of $6,747,000; plus the proceeds of $173,000 from the
exercise of incentive stock options pursuant to the equity incentive plan; plus
the related tax benefit of $12,000 from the disqualifying disposition relating
to the sale of incentive stock options issued pursuant to the equity incentive
plan; plus $29,000 for the issuance of vested stock awards from treasury; less
cash dividends declared of $2,312,000; less the purchase price of 70,590 shares
of common stock which was acquired and is now held as treasury stock at a cost
of $1,264,000; and plus the net increase in other comprehensive income, net of
tax, of $688,000. Changes in market conditions were the primary reason for the
net increase in unrealized appreciation in securities available for sale, which
increased other comprehensive income. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Company&#146;s primary
earnings source is net interest income, which is affected by changes in the
level of interest rates, the relationship between rates, the impact of interest
rate fluctuations on asset prepayments, the level and composition of deposits,
and the credit quality of earning assets. Management&#146;s asset/liability
objectives are to maintain a strong, stable net interest margin, to utilize its
capital effectively without taking undue risks, maintain adequate liquidity, and
reduce vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Company&#146;s
Asset/Liability Committee, comprised of members of senior management and the
Board, meets periodically to evaluate the impact of changes in market interest
rates on assets and liabilities, net interest margin, capital and liquidity.
Risk assessments are governed by policies and limits established by senior
management which are reviewed and approved by the full Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>As measured by the Interest
Sensitivity Gap Table, the Company&#146;s estimated one year cumulative interest
sensitivity gap (the difference between assets and liabilities that reprice or
mature within such period) was a negative $36,458,000, or (9.27)% of total
assets. A gap is considered negative when interest rate sensitive liabilities
maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceed the amount of
interest rate sensitive assets repricing or maturing within that same time
period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive
assets maturing or repricing within a specified time frame exceeds the amount of
interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within that same time
period. In a rising rate environment, an institution with a negative gap would
generally be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a
greater increase in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of its
assets and thus a decrease in the institution&#146;s net interest income,
whereas an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to
experience the opposite results. Conversely, during a period of falling rates, a
negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a
positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The economic environment
continually presents uncertainties as to future interest rate trends. The
Asset/Liability Committee regularly monitors the cumulative gap position, in
addition to utilizing a model that projects net interest income based on
increasing or decreasing interest rates, in order to be able to respond to
changes in interest rates by adjusting the gap position. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The following table sets
forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities
outstanding at December 31, 2001, which are anticipated by the Bank, using
certain assumptions based on historical experience and other data available to
management, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. The
amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a
particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to
repricing or contractual maturity of the asset or liability. This table does not
necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the
Bank&#146;s net interest income because actual repricing of various assets and
liabilities is subject to customer discretion and competitive and other
pressures and, therefore, actual experience may vary from that indicated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Certain shortcomings are
inherent in the method of analysis presented. For example, although certain
assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they
may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in
advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types
may lag behind changes in market interest rates. The table reflects the
estimates of management as to periods to repricing at particular points in time.
Among the factors considered, management monitors both current trends and its
historical repricing experience with respect to particular or similar products.
For example, the Bank has a number of deposit accounts, including passbook
savings, N.O.W. accounts and money market accounts which may be withdrawn at any
time. The Bank, based on historical experience, assumes that while all customers
in these account categories could withdraw their funds on any given day, they
will not do so, even if the market interest rates were to change. As a result,
different assumptions may be used at different points in time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Net interest income, the
primary contributor to earnings, represents the difference between income on
interest earning assets and expenses on interest bearing liabilities. Net

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The following table sets
forth certain information relating to the Bank&#146;s average consolidated
statements of financial condition and its consolidated statements of income for
the years indicated and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of
liabilities for the years indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by
dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities,
respectively, for the years shown. Average balances are derived from daily
average balances and include non-performing loans. The yields and costs include
fees which are considered adjustments to yields. Interest on nonaccruing loans
has been included only to the extent reflected in the consolidated statements of

respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume
multiplied by prior rate), (ii) changes attributable to changes in rates
(changes in rates multiplied by prior volume), and (iii) the net changes. For
purposes of this table, changes which are not due solely to volume changes or
rate changes have been allocated to these categories based on the respective
percentage changes in average volume and average rate as they compare to each

period analyzed, it is not possible to precisely allocate changes between volume
and rates. In addition, average earning assets include nonaccrual loans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Interest income on loans
(including fee income) increased $1,176,000 during 2001 the result of an
increase in average loans of 15.8% from $182,678,000 in 2000 to $211,458,000 in
2001. The yield on average loans for 2001 decreased to 8.6% from 9.3% for 2000.
Interest on investment in debt and equity securities increased $1,033,000 or
14.2% over 2000. The increase resulted from an increase in average investment in
debt and equity securities of 11.9% from $118,414,000 in 2000 to $132,486,000 in
2001. The tax adjusted average yield on debt and equity securities increased
from 6.8% in 2000 to 6.9% in 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Interest Expense.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Interest expense decreased
$885,000 to $7,868,000 in 2001 from $8,753,000 in 2000. The decrease of 10.1% in
interest expense was caused by the cost of average interest bearing liabilities
decreasing to 3.2% during 2001 from 4.0% during 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Provision for Loan Losses.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank&#146;s loan
portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial real
estate properties and residential properties located in the Bank&#146;s
principal lending area. The interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are
affected principally by the demand for such loans, the supply of money available
for lending purposes and the rates offered by its competitors. These factors
are, in turn, affected by general and economic conditions, monetary policies of
the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative tax
policies and governmental budgetary matters. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Total loans grew
$14,270,000 or 7.1% since fiscal year end 2000. Average loans grew by
$28,780,000 or 15.8% when compared to the prior year. Each component of the loan
portfolio contributed to the growth, however, real estate loans increased
$15,106,000 or 9.1% while all other loans decreased $880,000 or 2.5% over
December 31, 2000. Growth in real estate loans is partially attributed to a
change in holding strategy whereby originated variable rate residential
mortgages are held in portfolio instead of being sold on the secondary market,
and a marketing campaign promoting home equity loans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The performance of the loan
portfolio continued to be strong for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001.
Since December 31, 2000 non-performing loans decreased 44.6% from $769,000 to
$532,000, representing 0.25 % of loans, net, at December 31, 2001. The Company
had no foreclosed real estate at 12/31/01. Total non-performing assets
represented 0.14% of total assets at the corresponding date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>By adherence to its
disciplined underwriting standards the Bank has been able to minimize net losses
from impaired loans with net charge offs of $75,000 for the year ended December
31, 2001, as opposed to net recoveries of $24,000 for the year ended December
31, 2000. The Bank has maintained the strength of its loan portfolio, as
evidenced by its ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans of
441.4% and 273.1% at December 31, 2001and 2000, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Loans of approximately
$4,282,000 at December 31, 2001 were classified as potential problem loans.
These are loans for which management has information which indicates the
borrower may not be able to comply with the present payment terms. These loans
are subject to increased management attention and their classification is
reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Based on management&#146;s
continuing review of the overall loan portfolio and the current asset quality of
the portfolio, a provision for loan losses of $323,000 was recorded in 2001. A
$105,000 provision for loan losses was made for fiscal year end 2000. The
allowance for loan losses increased to $2,348,000 at December 31, 2001, as
compared to $2,100,000 at December 31, 2000. As a percentage of loans, the
allowance was 1.09% at December 31, 2001 and 1.04% at December 31, 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank seeks to maintain
its loans in performing status through, among other things, consistent
monitoring of nonperforming assets in an effort to return them to current
status. The Bank also monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis,
with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans, delinquency
trends, probable losses, past loss experience, current economic conditions,
concentrations of credit and other pertinent factors. Weight is also given to
input from the Bank&#146;s outside loan review consultants. Additions to the
allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are
charged to the allowance. Based on management&#146;s and the loan classification
committee&#146;s determination of the condition of the portfolio, the overall
level of reserves is periodically adjusted to account for the inherent and
specific risks within the entire portfolio. At minimum, the adequacy of these
reserves are adjusted quarterly, to a level deemed appropriate by management
based on their risk assessment of the entire portfolio. Based on the loan
classification committee&#146;s review of the classified loans and the overall
reserve levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at the year ended
December 31, 2001, management believes the allowance for possible loan losses is
adequate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>While management uses
available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the
allowance may be necessary based on changes in conditions. In addition, various
regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process,
periodically review the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may
require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their
judgements of the information available to them at the time of their
examination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Other Income.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Other income increased by
$685,000 or 39.5% to $2,419,000 in 2001 compared to $1,734,000 in 2000. Service
charges on deposit accounts for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled
$1,362,000, an increase of $305,000 or 28.9% over 2000. This increase is
attributed to a change, in January of 2001, in the process of charging fees for
checks drawn on non-sufficient funds and returned checks. Net gains on
securities of $78,000 were recognized in 2001 compared to net losses of $255,000
in 2000, an increase of $333,000 or 130.6%. These fluctuations in the net gains
and losses in securities sales result from management selling a portion of the
lowest yielding securities in the available for sale investment portfolio during
the second quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001 and reinvesting the
funds in securities earning current market rates of return. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Fees for other customer
services for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $875,000 an increase of
$100,000 or 12.9% over 2000. This increase is attributed to an increase in
merchant processing income due to an increase in the volume of merchant sales
during 2001 and fees received through the continued marketing of a new debit
card product introduced during the third quarter of 1999. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Other operating income for
the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $104,000, a decrease of $53,000 or
33.8% over the last year. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in income
from the gain on the sale of mortgages of $106,000 or 89.7% partially offset by
an insurance recovery resulting from a prior year loss totaling approximately
$51,000 that was recognized during the second quarter of 2001. During the prior
year, the Bank continued to sell mortgages into the secondary market as they
converted from the construction phase to permanent mortgages. As these loans run
off, the Bank instituted a change in strategy whereby originated variable rate
residential mortgages are held in portfolio instead of being sold on the
secondary market. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Other Expenses.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Other expenses increased by
$964,000 or 9.4% to $11,198,000 in 2001 from $10,234,000 in 2000. The components
of this change included an increase in salaries and employee benefits of
$749,000 or 13.9% reflecting salary and benefit increases and increased
staffing, primarily for the new branch office in Sag Harbor that the Bank opened
in the first quarter of 2001; an increase in net occupancy expense of $143,000
or 16.1%; and an increase in fixed asset expense of $67,000 or 8.2%. Increased
net occupancy expense resulted from the leasing of space for the new branch
office in Sag Harbor. The increase in furniture and fixture expense is
attributed to the depreciation of item processing assets located at the main
office and fixed assets for the new branch offices in Greenport, opened during
the second quarter of 2000, and Sag Harbor, opened in the first quarter of 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Total other operating
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $3,141,000 an increase of
$5,000 or 0.2% over the prior year. During the second half of 2001, the Bank
wrote off approximately $160,000 resulting from charge back losses on one
merchant processing vendor. At this time, the Bank does not foresee further
losses relative to this merchant as materially affecting earnings. During the
first quarter of 2000, the Company had incurred nonrecurring set up costs to
bring the item processing function in house. Expenses paid to a former vendor of
these services remained high during the transition period. With more item
processing transactions now being conducted in house, the fees paid to this
vendor, as well as the item processing printing costs, are steadily declining.
Item processing fees paid to an outside vendor decreased $75,000 or 93.2 % to
$6,000 in 2001 from $81,000 in 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Provision for Income Taxes.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The provision for income
taxes increased to $3,292,000 for 2001 from $2,464,000 for 2000. This increase
was due to income before income taxes increasing from $8,100,000 in 2000 to
$10,039,000 in 2001. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001
was 33% as compared to the prior year rate of 30%. This increase primarily
results from the Bank holding less tax exempt securities, and a reduction in the
consolidated subsidiary&#146;s income as a percentage of total income. </FONT></P>

charges on deposit accounts for the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled
$1,057,000, an increase of $77,000 or 7.9% over 1999. This increase primarily
resulted from increased deposits and an increase in fees charged on certain

to $39,000 in 2000 compared to $188,000 in 1999 due to a reduction in the number
of residential mortgages sold into the secondary market. The decrease was
partially offset by an increase in merchant processing fees resulting from a
change in the pricing structure made in the second quarter of 1999 and an
increase in the volume of merchant sales during 2000. Decreases in other income
were partially offset by fees received through the new debit card product
introduced during the third quarter of 1999, and fee income recognized as a
result of a referral relationship with another institution to provide wealth
management services to the Bank&#146;s customers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Other operating income for
the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled $157,000, a decrease of $298,000 or
65.5% over the last year. The decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in
income from the gain on the sale of mortgages of $273,000 or 70.6% to $113,000
in 2000 compared to $386,000 in 1999. Increased competition within the
Bank&#146;s market has decreased the return on residential mortgages; therefore
the Bank decided to focus less attention on these products. A portion of
originated residential mortgages are held in portfolio instead of being sold on
the secondary market. While revenue from mortgage banking operations was down,
corresponding expense reductions offset such decline. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Other Expenses.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Other expenses increased by
$623,000 or 6.5% to $10,234,000 in 2000 from $9,611,000 in 1999. The components
of this change included an increase in salaries and employee benefits of
$534,000 or 11.0% reflecting salary and benefit increases and increased staffing
primarily for the item processing department that the Bank moved in house in the
first quarter of 2000 and for the Greenport branch office opened in the spring
of 2000; and an increase in net occupancy expense of $136,000 or 18.1%.
Increased net occupancy expenses primarily resulted from increased rental
expenses relative to the leasing of space for the new branch offices in
Greenport and Sag Harbor. Renovation of the Sag Harbor branch office was
substantially complete at year end and the office opened during the first
quarter of 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Total other operating
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 totaled $3,136,000 a decrease of
$76,000 or 2.4% over the prior year. The decrease is partially due to the
elimination of item processing fees paid to a former vendor of these services.
Large one time expenses related to the implementation of in house item
processing, statement rendering and check imaging, partially offset these
decreased costs. A change in the processing of the merchant credit card program
during the first quarter of 2000, as well as increased marketing and business
development costs attributed to the opening of two new branches contributed to
increases in this category. A new branch office was opened in Greenport in April
2000 and the scheduled fourth quarter opening of the Sag Harbor office was
postponed to the first quarter of 2001 because of delays in the leasehold
improvements. Additionally, during the first half of 1999, the Bank incurred non
recurring expenses relative to the development of training programs and other
one time expenses due to the formation of a subsidiary. The Bank operates this
subsidiary as a Real Estate Investment Trust. These nonrecurring expenses were
not repeated in the current year, thereby partially offsetting the current
year&#146;s increases in other categories of operating expenses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Provision for Income Taxes.</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The provision for income
taxes increased to $2,464,000 for 2000 from $2,387,000 for 1999. This increase
was due to income before income taxes increasing from $7,154,000 in 1999 to
$8,100,000 in 2000. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2000
was 30% as compared to the prior year rate of 33%. This reduction is primarily
due to the implementation of the Bank&#146;s tax planning strategies including
holding additional tax exempt securities. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>LIQUIDITY</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The objective of liquidity
management is to ensure the availability of sufficient resources to meet all
financial commitments. Liquidity management addresses the ability to meet
deposit withdrawals either on demand or contractual maturity, to repay other
borrowings as they mature and to make new loans and investments as opportunities
arise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Company&#146;s
principal source of liquidity is dividends from the Bank. Due to regulatory
restrictions (see note 1k to the Consolidated Financial Statements), dividends
from the Bank to the Company at December 31, 2001 were limited to $9,704,000
which represents the Bank&#146;s 2001 retained net income and the net undivided
profits from the previous two years. The dividends received from the Bank are
used primarily for dividends to the shareholders. In the event the Company
subsequently expands its current operations, in addition to dividends from the
Bank, it will need to rely on its own earnings, additional capital raised and
other borrowings to meet liquidity needs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank&#146;s most liquid
assets are cash and cash equivalents, securities available for sale and
securities held to maturity due within one year. The levels of these assets are
dependent upon the Bank&#146;s operating, financing, lending and investing
activities during any given period. Other sources of liquidity include loan and
security principal repayments and maturities, lines of credit with other
financial institutions including the Federal Home Loan Bank, and growth in the
core deposit base. While scheduled loan amortization, maturing securities and
short term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit
flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates,
economic conditions and competition. The Bank adjusts its liquidity levels as
appropriate to meet funding needs such as deposit outflows, loans,
asset/liability objectives and suggested O.C.C. measurements such as loan to
capital ratios. Historically, the Bank has relied on its deposit base, drawn
from its market area through its nine full service offices, as its principal
source of funding. Although the Bank seeks to retain existing deposits and
maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive
interest rates to its customers, the Bank also strives to manage the overall
cost of the funds needed to finance its strategies. At December 31, 2001, the
Bank had aggregate lines of credit of $37,000,000 with unaffiliated
correspondent banks to provide short term credit for liquidity requirements. Of
these aggregate lines of credit, $17,000,000 is available on an unsecured basis.
The Bank also has the ability, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank
(&#147;FHLB&#148;) system, to borrow against its unencumbered residential
mortgages owned by the Bank. At December 31, 2001 the Bank had no such
borrowings outstanding. During the first quarter of 2001, the Bank also executed
a master repurchase agreement with the FHLB which increased its borrowing
capacity. The Bank does not anticipate the need to borrow under this agreement
in the near future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Company&#146;s
liquidity positions are monitored daily to ensure the maintenance of an optimum
level and efficient use of available funds. Excess short term liquidity is
invested in overnight federal funds sold. Management believes the Company
has sufficient liquidity to meet its operating requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=2>CAPITAL RESOURCES</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>As a result of
undistributed net income, plus the change in net unrealized appreciation in
securities available for sale, net of tax, and the issuance of shares of common
stock pursuant to the equity incentive plan, the Company&#146;s
stockholders&#146; equity increased to $32,861,000 at December 31, 2001 from
$28,788,000 at December 31, 2000. The ratio of stockholders&#146; equity to
total assets increased to 8.35% at year end 2001 from 8.12% at year end 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Loan commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2001 totaled approximately $70,953,000.  The funding of such commitments is
derived from the primary sources of liquidity stated previously.  See note 9b to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion
of loan commitments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Company exceeds the
risk-based capital adequacy ratio levels required by the regulatory agencies
(see note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes that
the current capital levels along with future retained earnings will allow the
Bank to maintain a position exceeding required levels which will be more than
adequate to meet the growth of the Bank or any higher ratios required by the
discretionary authority of the regulators. The Company is prepared to issue
additional common stock should the need arise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Company had return on
average equity of 23.13%, 21.86%, and 21.00% and return on average assets of
1.74%, 1.62%, and 1.59% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Consolidated Financial
Statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;), which require
the measurements of financial position and operating results in historical
dollars, or current value, without considering the changes in the relative
purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is
reflected in the increased costs of the Company&#146;s operations. Unlike
industrial companies, nearly all the assets and liabilities of the Company are
monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the
Company&#146;s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation.
Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or, to the same
extent, as the price of goods or services. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Significant increases in
the level of market interest rates also may adversely affect the fair value of
securities and other interest earning assets. At December 31, 2001, $143,261,000
or 100% of the Company&#146;s securities had fixed interest rates. Generally,
the value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates inversely with the changes in
interest rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could result in
decreases in the market value of interest earning assets which could adversely
affect the Company&#146;s results of operations if sold or, in the case of
interest earning assets classified as available for sale, the Company&#146;s
stockholders&#146; equity if retained. Increases in market interest rates also
could affect the type (fixed-rate or adjustable-rate) and amount of loans
originated by the Company and the average life of loans and securities, which
can adversely impact the yields earned on the Company&#146;s loans and
securities. In periods of decreasing interest rates, the average life of loans
held by the Company may be shortened to the extent increased prepayment activity
occurs during such periods which, in turn, may result in the investing of funds
from such prepayments in lower yielding assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>As in the case of the gap
table, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above
interest rate risk measurements. Modeling potential changes in the net interest
income require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect
the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market
interest rates. In this regard, the model presented assumes that the composition
of the Company&#146;s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the
beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also
assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across
the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific
assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income models
provide an indication of the Company&#146;s interest rate exposure at a
particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not
provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on
the Company&#146;s net interest income and will differ from actual results. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Bridge Bancorp, Inc.  (the "Company") is chartered by the State of New York as a single bank holding company.  The Company's
business currently consists of the operations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Bridgehampton National Bank (the "Bank").  The accounting
andreporting policies of the Bank conform to generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the financial
institutionindustry.  The following is a description of the more significant accounting policies that the Company follows in preparing its
Consolidated Financial Statements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>a) Basis of Financial Statement Presentation</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the accrual basis of
accounting and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, the Bank. All material intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
of each consolidated statement of condition and the related consolidated statement of income for the year then ended.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Certain reclassifications
have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year
presentation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>b) Cash and Cash Equivalents</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks and federal funds sold
which mature overnight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>c) Investment in Debt and Equity Securities</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Company follows
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No. 115
&#147;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.&#148;
Under SFAS No. 115, the Company is required to report readily-marketable equity
and debt securities in one of the following categories: (i)
&#147;held-to-maturity&#148; (management has a positive intent and ability to
hold to maturity) which are to be reported at amortized cost; (ii)
&#147;trading&#148; (held for current resale) which are to be reported at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings; and (iii)
&#147;available for sale&#148; (all other debt and marketable equity securities)
which are to be reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
reported net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate
component of stockholders&#146; equity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Included in investment
securities are mortgage-backed securities that have been categorized as
available for sale and as such represent participating interests in pools of
long term mortgage loans originated and serviced by the issuers of the
securities. These securities are carried at fair value. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Premiums and discounts on investment in debt and equity securities are amortized to expense and accreted to income over the estimated
life of the respective securities using the interest method.  Gains and losses on the sales of securities are recognized upon realization based
on the specific identification method.  Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are excluded from earnings and reported
as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>d) Loans and Loan Interest Income Recognition</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Loans are stated at unpaid principal balances, less unearned discounts and net deferred origination and commitment fees.  Loan
origination and commitment fees and certain direct costs incurred in connection with loan originations are deferred and amortized to income over
the life of the related loans as an adjustment to yield.  When a loan prepays, the remaining unamortized fee is taken into income.  Interest on
loans is credited to income based on the principal outstanding during the period.  Loans that are 90 days past due are placed on a
nonaccrual basis.  Exceptions to this policy are loans that are fully and adequately secured and are in the process of collection.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>All of the Bank&#146;s
nonaccruing loans are considered impaired under SFAS No. 114 &#147;Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.&#148; In accordance with SFAS No. 114, a
valuation allowance is established on impaired loans to reflect the difference,
if any, between face amount of the loan and the present value of expected future
cash flow discounted at the loan&#146;s effective interest rate, or as a
practical expedient, at the loan&#146;s observable market price or the fair
value of the collateral. </FONT></P>

<HR SIZE=5 NOSHADE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>e) Allowance for Loan Losses</FONT></P>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank monitors its portfolio on a regular basis, with consideration given to the detailed analysis of classified loans, delinquency
trends, probable losses, past loss experience, current economic conditions, concentrations of credit,  input from the Bank's outside loan review
consultants, and other pertinent factors.  Additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are
charged to the allowance.  Based on management's and the loan classification committee's determination of the condition of the portfolio, the
overall level of reserves is periodically adjusted to account for the inherent and specific risks within the entire portfolio.  At a minimum, the
adequacy of these reserves are adjusted quarterly, to a level deemed appropriate by management based on their risk assessment of the
entire portfolio.  Based on the loan classification committee's review of the classified loans and the overall reserve levels as they  relate to the
entire loan portfolio at the year ended December 31, 2001, management believes the allowance for possible loan losses is adequate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>While management uses
available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the
allowance may be necessary based on changes in conditions. In addition, various
regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process,
periodically review the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may
require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their
judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>f) Banking Premises and Equipment</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Banking premises and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation and amortization are provided for in amounts sufficient to relate
the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives (fifty years for buildings and two to ten years for equipment,
furniture and fixtures) on a straight-line basis.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the
service lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Expenditures for improvements and major renewals are capitalized, while the cost of ordinary maintenance, repairs and minor
improvements is charged to operations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>g) Other Real Estate Owned</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Other real estate owned consists of real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and is recorded at the lower of the
net unpaid principal balance at the foreclosure date plus acquisition costs or fair value.  Subsequent valuation adjustments are made if fair
value less estimated costs to sell the property falls below the carrying amount.  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company carried no
other real estate owned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>h) Income Taxes</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Company follows SFAS No.  109, which requires an asset and liability approach for accounting for income taxes.  The asset and
liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.  Under SFAS No.  109, deferred tax assets are recognized if it is
more likely than not that a future benefit will be realized.  It is management's position, as currently supported by the facts and
circumstances, that no valuation allowance is necessary against any of the Company's deferred tax assets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>i) Treasury Stock</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Repurchases of common stock
are recorded as treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock is reissued using the
first in, first out method. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>j) Earnings Per Share</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, diluted weighted average common stock and common stock equivalent shares
outstanding for the diluted earnings per share calculation were 4,222,669, 4,258,709 and 4,277,079, respectively.  For the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the total weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the basic earnings
per share calculation were 4,201,305, 4,236,668 and 4,250,823, respectively.  Diluted earnings per share, which reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options were exercised and resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the
earnings of the Company, is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and  common stock
equivalents.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>k) Dividends</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Cash available for dividend
distribution to shareholders of the Company must initially come from dividends
paid by the Bank to the Company. The approval of the Regional Administrator of
National Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in
any calendar year exceeds the total of the Bank&#146;s net income of that year
combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years. </FONT></P>


                                                                                                                                    <P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -21-</I></FONT></P>

<HR SIZE=5 NOSHADE>



<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank had approximately
$9,704,000 available as of December 31, 2001 which may be paid to the Company as
a dividend. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>l) Segment Reporting</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" requires public companies to report certain
financial information about significant revenue producing segments of the business for which such information is available and utilized by the
chief operating decision maker.  Specific information to be reported for individual operating segments includes a measure of profit and loss,
certain revenue and expense items, and total assets.  As a community-oriented financial institution, substantially all of the Company's
operations involve the delivery of loan and deposit products to customers.  Management makes operating decisions and assesses performance
based on an ongoing review of these community banking operations, which constitute the Company's only operating segment for financial
reporting purposes under SFAS No. 131.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>m) Stock Based Compensation Plans</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," encourages, but does not require companies to record compensation cost
for stock-based compensation plans at fair value.  The Company continues to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic
value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>n) Comprehensive Income</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Comprehensive income
includes net income and all other changes in equity during a period except those
resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Other
comprehensive income includes revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income
but excluded from net income. Comprehensive income and accumulated other
comprehensive income are reported net of related income taxes. Accumulated other
comprehensive income for the Company includes unrealized holding gains or losses
on available for sale securities. Such gains or losses are net of
reclassification adjustments for realized gains (losses) on sales of available
for sale securities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>o) New Accounting Pronouncements</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133").  This Statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.  It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value.  The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of a derivative and the resulting designation.  In June 1999, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 137 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of  FASB Statement No.
133" ("SFAS No. 137"). SFAS No. 133 is now effective for fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 2000 and does not require
restatement of prior periods.  The adoption of SFAS  No. 133 and 137 did not have any effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The FASB issued  SFAS No. 141 "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141").  This statement addresses the accounting and reporting
for business combinations and supersedes APB Opinion No. 16. This statement changes the accounting for business combinations in the
following respects:  by requiring that all business combinations be accounted for by a single method - the purchase accounting method,
by requiring that intangible assets be recognized as assets apart from goodwill if specific criteria is met, and by requiring additional
disclosure of the primary reasons for a business combination and the allocation  of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The FASB issued SFAS No. 142 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and
supersedes APB No.  17.  This statement addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets
should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition.  This statement also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets
should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements.  Specifically it requires that goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives, but without the constraint of an arbitrary ceiling.
In management's opinion the adoption of SFAS No. 141 and 142 will not have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated
Financial Statements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 "Accounting For Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143") and in August 2001
issued SFAS No. 144 "Accounting For The Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144").  SFAS No. 143 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. SFAS No. 144, which supercedes and amends certain existing accounting and reporting pronouncements, addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.  SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years</FONT></P>

                                                                                                                                    <P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><I>Page -22-</I></FONT></P>

<HR SIZE=5 NOSHADE>



<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>beginning after June 15, 2002 and  SFAS No. 144 is effective for the financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001.  Neither of these pronouncements is currently applicable to the Company.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>p) Reclassifications</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Certain reclassifications
have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year
presentation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>2.  INVESTMENT IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank did not hold any trading securities during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.  A summary of the amortized cost,

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Lending Risk.</B><BR>
The principal business of the Bank is lending, primarily in commercial real estate loans, construction loan mortgages, home equity
loans, land loans, consumer loans, home advantage loans, residential mortgages and commercial loans.  The Bank considers its primary
lending area as the two forks of the eastern end of Long Island in Suffolk County, New York, therefore, the loan portfolio as a whole is
dependent on the economic conditions of the geographic market served by the Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>Allowance for Loan Losses.</B><BR>
The Bank monitors its portfolio on a regular basis, with consideration given to the detailed analysis of classified loans, delinquency
trends, probable losses, past loss experience, current economic conditions, concentrations of credit,  input from the Bank's outside loan review
consultants, and other pertinent factors.  Additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are
charged to the allowance.  Based on management's and the loan classification committee's determination of the condition of the portfolio, the
overall level of reserves is periodically adjusted to account for the inherent and specific risks within the entire portfolio.  At a minimum, the
adequacy of these reserves are adjusted quarterly, to a level deemed appropriate by management based on their risk assessment of the
entire portfolio.  Based on the loan classification committee's review of the classified loans and the overall reserve levels as they  relate to the
entire loan portfolio at the year ended December 31, 2001, management believes the allowance for possible loan losses is adequate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>While management uses
available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the
allowance may be necessary based on changes in conditions. In addition, various
regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process,
periodically review the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may
require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their
judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>b.  Equity Incentive Plan</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>During 1996, the Bridge
Bancorp, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan was approved by the stockholders to provide
for the grant of options to purchase up to a total of 432,000 shares of common
stock of the Company and for the award of shares of common stock as a bonus.
During 2001 a plan amendment to cover non-employee directors was adopted by the
shareholders. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company
granted restricted stock awards of 5,553 and 5,346 shares, respectively. These
awards vest over three years on the anniversary date of the awards. Such shares
are subject to restrictions based on continued service as employees of the
Company or subsidiaries of the Company. Compensation expense attributable to
these awards was approximately $51,000 and $35,000 for the years ended December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Options awarded under the plan are determined
by the Incentive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company
accounts for this plan under APB Opinion No. 25, under which no compensation
cost has been recognized for stock options granted. Had compensation cost for
these stock options been determined consistent with SFAS No.123, the Company&#146;s net
income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma
amounts: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>During 2001, 2000, and
1999, the Bank maintained an overnight line of credit with the Federal Home Loan
Bank of New York (&#147;FHLB&#148;). The Bank has the ability to borrow against its unencumbered
residential mortgages and investment securities owned by the Bank. There were no
amounts outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>In March 2001 the Bank entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement with the FHLB whereby the FHLB agrees to purchase securities
from the Bank, upon the Bank's request, with the simultaneous agreement to sell the same or similar securities back to the Bank at a future
date.Securities are limited, under the agreement, to government securities, securities issued, guaranteed or
collateralized by any agency or instrumentality of the US Government or any
government sponsored enterprise, and non-Agency AA and AAA rated mortgage-backed
securities (including consolidated mortgage obligations (&#147;CMO&#146;s&#148;)

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>10.  ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Fair value estimates are
made at a specific point in time and are based on existing on and off balance
sheet financial instruments. Such estimates are generally subjective in nature
and dependent upon a number of significant assumptions associated with each
financial instrument or group of financial instruments, including estimates of
discount rates, risks associated with specific financial instruments, estimates
of future cash flows, and relevant available market information. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. In addition, fair value estimates do not reflect the value of anticipated future business, premiums or discounts that could result from
offering for sale at one time the Bank's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument, or the tax consequences of realizing gains or losses on
the sale of financial instruments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The following method and
assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of its
financial instruments: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Cash and Due from Banks and Federal Funds Sold: Carrying amounts approximate fair value, since these instruments are either payable
on demand or have short-term maturities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity: The estimated fair values are based on independent dealer quotations and quoted
market prices.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Loans: The estimated fair values of real estate mortgage loans and other loans receivable are based on discounted cash flow calculations
that apply interest rates currently being offered by the Bank for loans with similar remaining maturities to a schedule of aggregated
expected monthly maturities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Deposits: The estimated fair values of deposits are based on discounted cash flow calculations that apply interest rates currently being
offered by the Bank for deposits with similar remaining maturities to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Borrowings: The estimated
fair value of borrowed funds is based on the discounted value of contractual
cash flows using interest rates currently in effect for borrowings with similar
maturities and collateral requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable: For these short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of the fair
value. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>The Bank is subject to
various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking
agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain
mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if
undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank&#146;s financial
statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for
prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that
involve quantitative measures of the Bank&#146;s assets, liabilities, and
certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting
practices. The Bank&#146;s capital amounts and classification are also subject
to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings,
and other factors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios
(set forth in the following table) of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1
capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined).  Management believes, as of December 31, 2001, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy
requirements to which it is subject.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>As of December 31, 2001,
the most recent notification from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
categorized the Bank as &#147;well capitalized&#148; under the regulatory
framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as &#147;well
capitalized,&#148; the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1
risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. Since that
notification, there are no conditions or events that management believes have
changed the institution&#146;s category. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of Bridge Bancorp, Inc.  and subsidiary as of December 31,

period ended December 31, 2001.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bridge
Bancorp, Inc.  and subsidiary as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three year period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.</FONT></P>

loans were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same
terms, including interest rate and security, as those prevailing at the time for
comparable transactions with other persons, and do not represent more than
normal risk of collection or present other unfavorable features. The aggregate
amount of these loans was approximately $402,000 and $429,000 at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2001 no new loans to such persons were made
and repayments totaled $27,000. There were no loans to directors which were
nonaccruing at December 31, 2001 or 2000. </FONT></P>
