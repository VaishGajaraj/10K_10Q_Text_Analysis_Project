<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the
&#147;Registrant&#148; or &#147;Company&#148;) is a registered bank holding company, the
sole subsidiary of which is The Bridgehampton National Bank (the &#147;Bank&#148;). The
Registrant was organized as a New York business corporation and incorporated under the
laws of the State of New York in 1988, at the direction of the Board of Directors of the
Bank for the purpose of becoming a bank holding company pursuant to a plan of
reorganization; under the plan the former shareholders of the Bank became the shareholders
of the Company. Since commencing business in March 1989, after the reorganization, the
Registrant has functioned primarily as the holder of all of the Bank&#146;s common stock.
In May 1999, the Bank established a real estate investment trust subsidiary, Bridgehampton
Community, Inc. (&#147;BCI&#148;). The assets transferred to BCI are viewed by the
regulators as part of the Bank&#146;s assets in consolidation. The establishment of BCI
provides an additional vehicle for access by the Company to the capital markets for future
investment purposes. In April 2002, the Bank capitalized a financial subsidiary,
Bridgehampton Abstract Holding, LLC. This subsidiary, through its majority investment in
Bridge Abstract, LLC, provides an opportunity for the Bank to offer title insurance. This
financial subsidiary is not significant in terms of either assets or contributions to the
Registrant&#146;s results of operations for the year ended 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">At present, the Registrant does not
own or lease any property and has no paid employees. The Registrant uses the Bank&#146;s
space and employees without separate payment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Bank was established in 1910 as a
national banking association and is under the supervision of the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (the &#147;O.C.C.&#148;). Its headquarters are located at 2200 Montauk
Highway, Bridgehampton, New York 11932. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Bank, a community-oriented
financial institution, engages in full service commercial and consumer banking and limited
trust business, including accepting time and demand deposits from the areas surrounding
its branch offices. These deposits, together with funds generated from operations and
borrowings, are invested primarily in (1) mortgages, secured and unsecured commercial and
consumer loans; (2) mortgage backed securities; (3) obligations of New York State and
local political subdivisions; and (4) U.S. government agency and treasury securities. In
addition, the Bank offers merchant credit and debit card processing, automated teller
machines, cash management services, online banking services, safe deposit boxes and
individual retirement accounts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The mission of the Company is to
achieve excellence in financial performance and build long-term shareholder value through
a steadfast commitment to our people, our customer relationships, and the community. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The business strategies, which are
integral to the Company&#146;s blueprint for growth, incorporate the following principles:</FONT></P>
<UL>

<LI>Commitment to excellence in financial performance,</LI>
<LI>Building market share on eastern Long Island through the provision of core bankingproducts that stimulate deposits and meet the credit requirements of the community,</LI>
<LI> Expansion of lines of business with products that complement our market niche,</LI>
<LI>Dedication to outstanding levels of service to our customers, </LI>
<LI>Selection and retention of the highest quality employees, and </LI>
<LI>Effective management of capital.</LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Building long-term relationships with
our customers remains the cornerstone of the Bank&#146;s brand. Key to the Bank&#146;s
ability to attract and retain customer relationships is the responsiveness of our senior
management team, and a dedication to providing more for our customers in the way of
products and services that keep pace. The development of lines of business that complement
the Bank&#146;s market niche is essential to the Bank&#146;s success and overall business
strategy. Outstanding customer service and an unwavering commitment to community
involvement continue to be key to the Company&#146;s corporate culture. We anticipate that
this dedication will serve us well in the future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">With respect to the underwriting of
loans, there are certain risks, including the risk of non-payment, that are associated
with each type of loan that the Company markets. Risks associated with real estate loans
include concentrations of loans in a loan type such as commercial real estate and
fluctuating values of land and improved properties. The primary risks associated with
commercial loans are the experience and quality of the borrower&#146;s management, the
business climate, the cash flow of the business and the impact of economic factors. The</FONT></P>

<HR SIZE="5" COLOR="Gray"><!-- *************************************************************************** -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2"> primary risks
associated with consumer loans relate to the borrower, such as the risk of a
borrower&#146;s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions or the
amount and nature of a borrower&#146;s other existing indebtedness, and the value of the
collateral securing the loan if the Company must take possession of the collateral.
Consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of
loan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Company&#146;s strategy in
addressing and managing these types of risks is to follow its loan policies and
underwriting practices, which include (i) granting loans on a sound and collectible basis;
(ii) investing funds profitably for the benefit of the shareholders and the protection of
depositors; (iii) understanding the needs of the business and the community and the
Company&#146;s general market area while maintaining a balance between maximum yield and
minimum risk; (iv) ensuring that primary, secondary and tertiary sources of repayment are
adequate in relation to the amount of the loan; (v) developing and maintaining adequate
diversification of the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each loan
category; (vi) ensuring that each loan is properly documented; and (vii) developing and
applying adequate collection procedures. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Company introduced a new
corporate logo in June 2002. Its design reflects the synergy of a group of financial
service companies, led by and including the Bank. The logo communicates the strength and
stability of the Bank as a traditional banking provider and also the wider range of
services provided by the companies that comprise The Bridge Group. The Bridge Group
derives its name from the name of the holding company, Bridge Bancorp, Inc. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">As part of the Company&#146;s
strategy to find ways to best utilize its available capital, during 2001 the Company
instituted a stock repurchase plan repurchasing 117,590 shares of its common stock under
the plan. In February 2002, the Company reapproved its stock repurchase plan allowing the
repurchase of up to 5% of its current outstanding shares. The total number of treasury
shares at December 31, 2002 was 139,611, or 3.3% of the total number of outstanding common
shares of 4,117,986. At December 31, 2002, 61,264 shares remain to be repurchased under
the current approved stock repurchase plan. In February 2003, the Company reaffirmed its
stock repurchase program. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Bank employs 113 people on a
full-time and part-time basis. The Bank provides a variety of employment benefits and
considers its relationship with its employees to be positive. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">All phases of the Bank&#146;s
business are highly competitive. The Bank faces direct competition from a significant
number of financial institutions operating in its market area, many with a statewide or
regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence. Most of these competitors are
significantly larger than the Bank, and therefore have greater financial and marketing
resources than those of the Bank. The Bank considers its major competition to be local
commercial banks as well as other commercial banks with branches in the Bank&#146;s market
area. The Bank&#146;s market area is located on eastern Long Island, which is comprised of
five towns: Riverhead, Southampton, East Hampton, Shelter Island and Southold. Although
the Bank does maintain some customer relationships in Riverhead and Shelter Island towns,
the majority of its customer base, and all of its branches are located in the towns of
Southampton, East Hampton, and Southold. Population of the five towns in 2002 totaled
128,707. Excluding Riverhead and Shelter Island, the population was comprised of 56,254
residents in Southampton, 20,275 in East Hampton, and 21,015 in Southold. Population in
these towns grew 1.35%, 1.76% and 0.86%, respectively, from 2001 to 2002. Median age of
residents in 2002 was 40.4 in Southampton, 41.6 in East Hampton, and 44.7 in Southold.
Median family income in 2002 was $65,144 in Southampton, $52,201 in East Hampton, and
$61,108 in Southold. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Eastern Long Island is semi-rural. In
recent years, the wine industry has matured, and currently there are approximately 25
vineyards located in the region. Surrounded by water and including the Hamptons, the
region is a recreational destination for the New York metropolitan and surrounding areas.
Retail establishments; construction and trades; restaurants, bars, lodging and recreation;
and professional entities predominate among industries represented in this marketplace.
Other industries that have grown significantly over the past five years include real
estate, health services, wholesale distributors, and agricultural and related businesses.
The vast majority of businesses are considered small businesses employing fewer than ten
full-time employees, with most employing fewer than five. Key employers in the region
include the municipalities, school districts, hospitals, and financial institutions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Registrant is subject to the
regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The primary banking agency responsible for regulating the Bank is the
Comptroller of the Currency. The Bank also is subject to regulation and supervision by the
Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Additional
information on regulatory requirements is set forth in Note 11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">On July 30, 2002, President Bush
signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#147;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#148;). This
legislation impacts corporate governance of public companies, affecting their officers and
directors, their audit committees, their relationships with their accountants and the
audit function itself. Certain provisions of the Act became effective on July 30, 2002.
Others will become effective as the SEC adopts appropriate rules. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=1>(2) On July 20, 1998, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable
August 31, 1998, to shareholders of record as of August 19, 1998.  As a result, $14,439,990 was transferred from Undivided
Profits and Capital Surplus at August 19, 1998 to reflect the issuance.  All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect
the effects of this split.</font></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=1>(3) The equity section of the balance sheet also reflects the decrease in the par value of the Company's Common Stock from a
par value of Five Dollars ($5.00) per share to a par value of One Cent ($0.01) per share.  This change was authorized by the
Board of Directors and adopted by the Shareholders at the Company's April 19, 1999 annual meeting.  The change was
effectuated during the second quarter of 1999 by filing an amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation.  Such
reduction in par value permitted the Company to decrease its stated capital by approximately $21,203,000.  Capital surplus
increased by approximately $21,203,000, thereby providing the Company with the ability to allow payments of dividends from
surplus if deemed advisable or necessary by the Board of Directors.  Capital surplus has not been restated for prior
periods.  It should be realized, however, that as a practical matter the Company would only have the ability to pay out a
moderate proportion of the aggregate increase in capital surplus as dividends since there are regulatory restrictions on the
payment of dividends.</font></p>

Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "PSLRA").  Such forward-looking statements, in addition to historical
information, which involve risk and uncertainties, are based on the beliefs, assumptions and expectations of management of the
Company.  Words such as "expects," "believes," "should," "plans," "anticipates," "will," "potential," "could," "intend," "may,"
"outlook," "predict," "project," "would," "estimates," and variations of such similar expressions are intended to identify such
forward-looking statements.  Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, possible or assumed estimates
with respect to the financial condition, expected or anticipated revenue, and results of operations and business of the Company,
including with respect to earnings growth [on both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP")
and cash basis]; revenue growth in retail banking, lending and other areas; origination volume in the Company`s consumer, commercial
and other lending businesses; current and future capital management programs; non-interest income levels, including fees from

Factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include, but are not limited to, prevailing
economic conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, changes in tax
policies, rates and regulations of federal, state and local tax authorities, changes in interest rates, deposit flows, the cost of
funds, demand for loan products, demand for financial services, competition, changes in the quality and composition of the Bank's

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2002 contains a summary of our significant accounting
policies.  Various elements of our accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation
assumptions and other subjective assessments.  Our policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan
losses is our most critical accounting policy.  This policy is important to the presentation of our financial condition and results
of operations, and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments,
which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters.  The use of different judgments, assumptions and
estimates could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Following is a description of our critical accounting policy and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying its
application.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2"><I>ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES</I></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses
inherent in our loan portfolio.  We evaluate the adequacy of our allowance on a quarterly basis.  The allowance is comprised of both
individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances.  The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance
with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies."</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis, with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans,
delinquency trends, probable incurred losses, past loss experience, current economic conditions, and concentrations of credit.
Additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged to the allowance.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Individual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process
including the procedures for impairment testing under SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, an Amendment
of FASB Statements No. 5 and 15," and SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and
Disclosures, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 114." Such evaluation, which includes a review of loans for which full collectibility
is not reasonably assured, considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, if any, current economic and regulatory
conditions, current and historical loss experience of similar loans and other factors that determine risk exposure to arrive at an</font></p>

<HR SIZE=5 COLOR=GRAY NOSHADE><!-- *************************************************************************** -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">adequate loan loss allowance for a specific loan. Pursuant to our policy, loan losses must be charged-off in the period the loans, or
portions thereof, are deemed uncollectible.  Assumptions and judgments by management, in conjunction with outside sources, are used
to determine whether full collectibility of a loan is not reasonably assured; the estimates of the fair value of the underlying
collateral; and the assessments of economic and regulatory conditions.  Individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a
result of changes in these assumptions and judgments.  Individual loan analyses are periodically performed on commercial or secured
consumer loans.  The result of these analyses is the allocation of the overall allowance to individual valuation allowances for
specific loans considered impaired.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Loan pool valuation allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risks associated with
our lending activities, but which, unlike individual allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.  The
determination of the adequacy of the valuation allowance is a process that takes into consideration a variety of factors.  Loan pool
analyses are performed on the balance of the Bank's loan portfolio, primarily consisting of real estate loans as well as secured and
unsecured commercial and consumer loans.  The pools consist of aggregations of homogeneous loans having similar credit risk
characteristics.  Examples of pools defined by the Bank for this purpose are:  home equity lines of credit, residential mortgages,
commercial mortgages, consumer and commercial construction loans, commercial lines of credit and commercial installment loans and
unsecured consumer loans.  For each such defined pool there is a set of sub-pools based upon delinquency status, including: current,
30-59 days past due, 60-89 days past due, over 90 days past due and loans deemed classified by the Classification Committee of the
Board of Directors.  For each sub-pool, the Bank has developed a range of valuation allowances necessary to adequately provide for
probable incurred losses inherent in that pool of loans.  These ranges are based upon a number of factors, including the risk
characteristics of the pool, as well as probable and incurred loss and migration experience considering current economic conditions
and industry norms.  We also consider the growth in the portfolio as well as our credit administration and asset management
philosophies and procedures. In addition, we evaluate and consider the impact that existing and projected economic and market
conditions may have on the portfolio as well as known and inherent risks in the portfolio. Finally, we evaluate and consider the
allowance ratios and coverage percentages of both peer group and regulatory agency data. The ranges of loan pool valuation allowances
developed by the Bank are applied to the outstanding principal balance of the loans in each pool and sub-pool; as a result, further
allocations of the valuation allowance are made.  These evaluations are inherently subjective because, even though they are based on
objective data, it is management's interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The adequacy of the reserves are adjusted quarterly, to a level deemed appropriate by management, based on their risk assessment of
the entire portfolio.  Based on the Classification Committee's review of the classified loans and the overall reserve levels as they
relate to the entire loan portfolio at December 31, 2002, management believes the allowance for loan losses has been established and
maintained at levels adequate to reflect the probable losses incurred in our loan portfolio. While management uses available
information to recognize losses on loans, future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in
economic or market conditions.  Changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance.  In addition, various
regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, periodically review the Bank's allowance for loan losses.  Such
agencies may require the Bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them
at the time of their examination.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Bridge Bancorp, Inc.  ("the Company"), a New York corporation, is a one-bank holding company formed effective March 31, 1989, and on
a parent-only basis, had minimal results of operations for 2002, 2001 and 2000.  In the event the Company subsequently expands its
current operations, it will be dependent on dividends from its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Bridgehampton National Bank ("the Bank"),
its own earnings, additional capital raised and borrowings as sources of funds.  The information below reflects principally the
financial condition and results of operations of the Bank.  The Bank's results of operations are primarily dependent on its net
interest income, which is mainly the difference between interest income on loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and
borrowings.  Interest income on loans and investments is a function of the average balances outstanding and the average rates earned
during a period.  Interest expense is a function of the average amount of interest bearing deposits and the average rates paid on
such deposits during a period.  The Bank also generates other income, such as fee income on deposit accounts and merchant credit and
debit card processing programs, and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans.  The Bank's net income is further affected
by the level of its other expenses, such as employees' salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and
administrative expenses and income tax expense.  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in this filing.  Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts, and the related discussion and analysis, to conform to the current year
presentation.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2"><I>OVERVIEW</I></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The record earnings performance in 2002 reflects multiple factors including:  (a) the continued branch expansion program resulting in
deposit growth to $406,409,000, a 13.8% increase over 2001, (b) maintenance of a strong net interest margin, (c) interest earning
asset growth,  (d) control over operating expenses, (e) continued strong credit quality, and (f) increased fee income.  Each of these
elements is discussed in the following sections.  The Company continues to be dedicated to maintaining this performance through
strategic planning and effective action to continue its goals.  The Company's results of operations are significantly affected by
general economic and competitive conditions (particularly changes in market interest rates), government policies, changes in
accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies.  Management seeks to maintain the Company's asset quality for loans and

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The assets of the Company totaled $463,986,000 at December 31, 2002, an increase of $70,463,000 or 17.9% from the previous year-end.
This increase mainly results from an increase in debt and equity securities of $50,178,000 or 35.0%, and an increase in total loans
of $33,026,000 or 15.3%.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Bank's loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial and residential properties located in the
Bank's principal lending area.  Interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected principally by market indices, competition,
relationship and risk.  These factors are, in turn, affected by general and economic conditions, monetary policies of the federal
government, including the Federal Reserve Board, legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Total loans grew $33,026,000 or 15.3% since year end 2001.  Average loans grew by $17,262,000 or 8.2% when compared to the prior
year.  Each component of the loan portfolio contributed to the growth; real estate mortgage loans increased $17,012,000 or 9.9%, real
estate construction loans increased $3,736,000 or 42.5%,  installment/consumer loans increased $1,862,000 or 30.3% and commercial and
financial loans increased $10,411,000 or 36.8% since December 31, 2001.  Growth in real estate loans is partially attributed to an
increase in commercial mortgages and a marketing campaign promoting home equity loans.</font></p>

for sale portfolio increased 43.5% to $182,416,000 primarily as a result of increased
holdings due to excess funds from increased deposits, and increases in principal
repayments on loans and securities. Funds were deployed primarily into bullet agency
securities and mortgage-backed securities, as the Bank filled out its liquidity ladder
while maintaining shorter maturities in this historically low rate environment. Securities
held as available for sale may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in
interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or other factors. Obligations of U.S.
Government Agencies increased to $57,965,000 at December 31, 2002 from $17,300,000 at

increase in overnight borrowings of $12,300,000 from the prior year-end. Demand deposits
increased $10,494,000 or 9.1%. This increase is attributed to growth in deposits partially
associated with business development efforts in new and existing markets. Savings, N.O.W.
and money market deposits increased $33,755,000 or 18.3%. This increase is primarily
attributed to increased money market deposits both in public fund accounts and individual,

MANAGEMENT</I> </FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Company&#146;s primary earnings
source is net interest income, which is affected by changes in the level of interest
rates, the relationship between rates, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset
prepayments, the level and composition of deposits, and the credit quality of earning
assets. Management&#146;s asset and liability objectives are to maintain a strong, stable
net interest margin, to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks, to
maintain adequate liquidity, and to reduce vulnerability of its operations to changes in
interest rates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Company&#146;s Asset and
Liability Committee, comprised of members of senior management and the Board, meets
quarterly to evaluate the impact of changes in market interest rates on assets and
liabilities, net interest margin, capital and liquidity. Risk assessments are governed by
policies and limits established by senior management which are reviewed and approved by
the full Board of Directors. The economic environment continually presents uncertainties
as to future interest rate trends. The Asset and Liability Committee regularly utilizes a
model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates,
in order to be able to respond to changes in interest rates. </FONT></P>

INCOME</I> </FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Net interest income, the primary
contributor to earnings, represents the difference between income on interest earning
assets and expenses on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends upon the
volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates
earned or paid on them. </FONT></P>

financial condition and its consolidated statements of income for the years indicated and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Net interest income also can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changing rates and changing volumes. The following table
illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing
liabilities have affected the Bank's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in
each category with respect to (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate), (ii)
changes attributable to changes in rates (changes in rates multiplied by prior volume), and (iii) net changes. For purposes of this
table, changes which are not due solely to volume changes or rate changes have been allocated to these categories based on the
respective percentage changes in average volume and average rate as they compare to each other. Due to the numerous simultaneous
volume and rate changes during the period analyzed, it is not possible to precisely allocate changes between volume and rates. In
addition, average earning assets include nonaccrual loans. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Net income for 2002 totaled $8,517,000, or $2.05 per share, as compared to net income of $6,747,000 or $1.60 per share for the year
ended December 31, 2001.  Net income for 2002 increased $1,770,000 or 26.2%, over 2001.  Highlights include:  (i) a $2,855,000 or
14.9% increase in net interest income; (ii) a $986,000 or 40.8% increase in total other income; and (iii) a $744,000 or 6.6% increase
in total other expenses over the same period in 2001.  The provision for income taxes increased $1,430,000 or 43.4%.  In addition,
net income reflects returns of 25.93% on average total stockholders' equity and 1.93% on average total assets as compared to the
corresponding figures for December 31, 2001 of 23.13% on average total stockholders' equity and 1.74% on average total assets.  For
purposes of these calculations, average stockholders' equity excludes the effects of changes in other comprehensive income, net of

reflects an increase in average interest earning assets to $413,632,000 in 2002 from $359,795,000 in 2001 or 15.0%.  Average interest
bearing liabilities increased to $283,793,000 in 2002 from $245,546,000 in 2001or 15.6%.    The tax adjusted net yield on average

<HR SIZE=5 COLOR=GRAY NOSHADE><!-- *************************************************************************** -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Interest income on loans (including fee income) decreased $703,000 during 2002, as a result of a decrease in interest rates, offset
by an increase in average loans of 8.2% to $228,720,000 in 2002 from $211,458,000 in 2001.  The yield on average loans for 2002
decreased to 7.6% from 8.6% for 2001. Interest on investment in debt and equity securities increased $414,000 or 5.0% over 2001.  The
increase resulted from an increase in average investment in debt and equity securities of 26.7% to $167,924,000 in 2002 from
$132,486,000 in 2001.  The tax adjusted average yield on debt and equity securities decreased to 5.7% in 2002 from 6.9% in 2001.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2"><B>Interest Expense.</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Interest expense decreased $3,378,000 to $4,490,000 in 2002 from $7,868,000 in 2001.  The decrease of 42.9% in interest expense was
caused by the cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreasing to 1.6% during 2002 from 3.2% during 2001.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2"><B>Provision for Loan Losses.</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Total loans grew $33,026,000 or 15.3% since year end 2001.  Average loans grew by $17,262,000 or 8.2% when compared to the prior
year.  Each component of the loan portfolio contributed to the growth, however, real estate mortgage loans were the primary
contributor and increased $17,012,000 or 9.9%.  Commercial loans increased $10,411,000 or 36.8% over December 31, 2001.    Growth in
real estate loans is partially attributed to an increase in commercial mortgages and a marketing campaign promoting home equity
loans.  Fixed rate loans represented 17.0% of total loans at December 31, 2002 and 22.5% of total loans at December 31, 2001.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The performance of the loan portfolio continued to be strong for the year ended December 31, 2002.  Since December 31, 2001
non-performing loans decreased 62.4% from $532,000 to $200,000, representing 0.08% of loans, net, at December 31, 2002.  The Company
had no foreclosed real estate at December 31, 2002.  Total non-performing assets represented 0.04% of total assets at the
corresponding date.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">By adherence to disciplined underwriting standards the Bank has minimized net losses from loans with net charge-offs of $155,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2002.  Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $75,000.  The Bank has maintained the
strength of its loan portfolio, as evidenced by its ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans of 1147.0% and 422.7%
at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Loans of approximately $8,417,000 at December 31, 2002 were classified as potential problem loans, which represent 3.4% of total
loans.  These are loans for which management has information that indicates the borrower may not be able to comply with the present
repayment terms.  This was an increase from 2001 of $4,135,000, which represented 1.9% of total loans.  These loans are subject to
increased management attention and their classification is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis.  Management implemented an
enhanced loan review analysis process during 2002, which assists in the early identification of problem loans.  Due to the structure
and nature of the credits, management is confident that the likelihood of sustaining a significant loss on these relationships is
remote.</font></p>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Based on management's continuing review of the overall loan portfolio and the current asset quality of the portfolio, a provision for
loan losses of $220,000 was recorded in 2002.  A $323,000 provision for loan losses was made for fiscal year end 2001.  The allowance
for loan losses increased to $2,294,000 at December 31, 2002, as compared to $2,249,000 at December 31, 2001.  As a percentage of
loans, the allowance was 0.92% at December 31, 2002 and 1.04% at December 31, 2001.</font></p>

accounts for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $2,024,000, an increase of $662,000 or 48.6% over 2001. This increase is primarily attributed to an increase in service
charge fees implemented in February 2002 and a decrease in the volume of waived fees during 2002. There were no net gains on securities during 2002 while net gains on
securities of $78,000 were recognized in 2001. Fees for other customer services for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $1,280,000, an increase of $405,000 or 46.3% over
2001. This increase is partially attributed to merchant processing income due to an increase in the volume of merchant sales. Additionally during 2002, all ATM cards were
converted to ATM/debit cards producing higher fee income.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $101,000, a decrease of $3,000 or 2.9% over the last year.
This decrease is due to the receipt of an insurance recovery resulting from a prior year loss totaling approximately $51,000 that was recognized during the second quarter of 2001. </FONT></P>

Other expenses increased by $744,000 or 6.6% to $11,942,000 in 2002 from $11,198,000 in 2001.  The components of this change included
an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $220,000 or 3.6%, reflecting salary and benefit increases and increased staffing,
primarily for the new branch office in Hampton Bays that was staffed in the second quarter of 2002 and opened in July 2002; an
increase in net occupancy expense of $107,000 or 10.4%; and an increase in furniture and fixture expense of $91,000 or 10.3%.
Increases in net occupancy, as well as furniture and fixture expense, were partially attributed to the cost associated with the new
branch offices.  This increase also is attributed to depreciation expense of management information systems that were purchased
during 2001 and the first quarter of 2002.  Systems were purchased partially due to the introduction of consumer Internet banking.
Increased advertising also attributed to this change as the Bank actively marketed its new branch network and product offerings.</FONT> </P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Included in employee benefits is the expense of $155,000 and $100,000 for December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to a
non-contributory pension plan covering all of the Bank&#146;s eligible employees.  See Note 7.a to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The pension expense is based upon a standard set of assumptions:  discount rate, salary scale and the expected return on assets.  The
Bank continually reviews these assumptions to ensure the appropriate expense is recorded and a correct level of funding is
maintained.  Various factors were reviewed including, but not limited to Moody&#146;s ratings, U.S. Treasury rates, and other trends. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Other operating expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2002 totaled $2,863,000, an increase of $292,000 or 11.4% over the
prior year. Increases were attributable to stationery costs as a result of the new logo as
well as increases in consulting expenses. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The provision for income taxes increased
to $4,722,000 for 2002 from $3,292,000 for 2001. This increase was due to income before
income taxes increasing to $13,239,000 in 2002 from $10,039,000 in 2001. The effective tax
rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 36% as compared to the prior year rate of
33%. This increase primarily results from the Bank holding less tax-exempt securities, and
a reduction in the consolidated subsidiary&#146;s income as a percentage of total income. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Bank&#146;s loan portfolio
consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial real estate properties and
residential properties located in the Bank&#146;s principal lending area. The interest
rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans,
the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by its
competitors. These factors are, in turn, affected by general and economic conditions,
monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve Board,
legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Total loans grew $14,270,000 or 7.1%
since fiscal year end 2000. Average loans grew by $28,780,000 or 15.8% when compared to
the prior year. Each component of the loan portfolio contributed to the growth, however,
real estate loans increased $15,106,000 or 9.1% while all other loans decreased $880,000
or 2.5% over December 31, 2000. Growth in real estate loans is partially attributed to a
change in holding strategy whereby originated variable rate residential mortgages are held
in portfolio instead of being sold on the secondary market, and a marketing campaign
promoting home equity loans. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The performance of the loan portfolio
continued to be strong for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001. Since December 31,
2000 non-performing loans decreased 44.6% from $769,000 to $532,000, representing 0.25 %
of loans, net, at December 31, 2001. The Company had no foreclosed real estate at December
31, 2001. Total non-performing assets represented 0.14% of total assets at the
corresponding date. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">By adherence to its disciplined
underwriting standards the Bank has been able to minimize net losses from impaired loans
with net charge offs of $75,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001, as opposed to net
recoveries of $24,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Bank has maintained the
strength of its loan portfolio, as evidenced by its ratio of allowance for loan losses to
non-performing loans of 422.7% and 273.1% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. </FONT></P>

December 31, 2001 were classified as potential problem loans. These are loans for which
management has information, which indicates the borrower may not be able to comply with
the present payment terms. These loans are subject to increased management attention and
their classification is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Based on management&#146;s continuing
review of the overall loan portfolio and the current asset quality of the portfolio, a
provision for loan losses of $323,000 was recorded in 2001. A $105,000 provision for loan
losses was made for fiscal year end 2000. The allowance for loan losses increased to
$2,249,000 at December 31, 2001, as compared to $2,100,000 at December 31, 2000. As a
percentage of loans, the allowance was 1.04% at December 31, 2001 and 2000. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Bank seeks to maintain its loans
in performing status through, among other things, consistent monitoring of non-performing
assets in an effort to return them to current status. The Bank also monitors its entire
loan portfolio on a regular basis, with consideration given to detailed analysis of
classified loans, delinquency trends, probable losses, past loss experience, current
economic conditions, concentrations of credit. and other pertinent factors. Weight is also
given to input from the Bank&#146;s outside loan review consultants. Additions to the
allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of recoveries, are charged to
the allowance. Based on management&#146;s and the loan classification committee&#146;s
determination of the condition of the portfolio, the overall level of reserves is
periodically adjusted to account for the inherent and specific risks within the entire
portfolio. At minimum, the adequacy of these reserves are adjusted quarterly, to a level
deemed appropriate by management based on their risk assessment of the entire portfolio.
Based on the loan classification committee&#146;s review of the classified loans and the
overall reserve levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at the year ended
December 31, 2001, management believes the allowance for possible loan losses is adequate. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">While management uses available
information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be
necessary based on changes in conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an
integral part of the examination process, periodically review the Bank&#146;s allowance
for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the
allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of
their examination. </FONT></P>

accounts for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $1,362,000, an increase of $305,000
or 28.9% over 2000. This increase is attributed to a change, in January of 2001, in the
process of charging fees for checks drawn on non-sufficient funds and returned checks. Net
gains on securities of $78,000 were recognized in 2001 compared to net losses of $255,000
in 2000, an increase of $333,000 or 130.6%. These fluctuations in the net gains and losses
in securities sales result from management selling a portion of the lowest yielding
securities in the available for sale investment portfolio during the second quarter of
2000 and the first quarter of 2001 and reinvesting the funds in securities earning current
market rates of return. </FONT></P>

the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled $875,000, an increase of $100,000 or 12.9% over
2000. This increase is attributed to an increase in merchant processing income due to an
increase in the volume of merchant sales during 2001 and fees received through the
continued marketing of a new debit card product introduced during the third quarter of
1999. </FONT></P>

ended December 31, 2001 totaled $104,000, a decrease of $53,000 or 33.8% over the last
year. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in income from the gain on the sale of
mortgages of $106,000 or 89.7% partially offset by an insurance recovery resulting from a
prior year loss totaling approximately $51,000 that was recognized during the second
quarter of 2001. During the prior year, the Bank continued to sell mortgages into the
secondary market as they converted from the construction phase to permanent mortgages. As
these loans run off, the Bank instituted a change in strategy whereby originated variable
rate residential mortgages are held in portfolio instead of being sold on the secondary
market. </FONT></P>

included an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $749,000 or 13.9% reflecting
salary and benefit increases and increased staffing, primarily for the new branch office

occupancy expense of $143,000 or 16.1%; and an increase in fixed asset expense of $67,000
or 8.2%. Increased net occupancy expense resulted from the leasing of space for the new
branch office in Sag Harbor. The increase in furniture and fixture expense is attributed
to the depreciation of item processing assets located at the main office and fixed assets
for the new branch offices in Greenport, opened during the second quarter of 2000, and Sag

resulting from charge back losses on one merchant processing vendor. At this time, the
Bank does not foresee further losses relative to this merchant as materially affecting
earnings. During the first quarter of 2000, the Company had incurred nonrecurring set up
costs to bring the item processing function in house. Expenses paid to a former vendor of
these services remained high during the transition period. With more item processing
transactions now being conducted in house, the fees paid to this vendor, as well as the
item processing printing costs, are steadily declining. Item processing fees paid to an

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The provision for income taxes increased
to $3,292,000 for 2001 from $2,464,000 for 2000. This increase was due to income before
income taxes increasing from $8,100,000 in 2000 to $10,039,000 in 2001. The effective tax
rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 33% as compared to the prior year rate of
30%. This increase primarily results from the Bank holding less tax-exempt securities, and
a reduction in the consolidated subsidiary&#146;s income as a percentage of total income. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The objective of liquidity management
is to ensure the availability of sufficient resources to meet all financial commitments.
Liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on demand or

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Company&#146;s principal source
of liquidity is dividends from the Bank. Due to regulatory restrictions (see Note 1.k to
the Consolidated Financial Statements), dividends from the Bank to the Company at December
31, 2002 were limited to $11,656,000, which represents the Bank&#146;s 2002 retained net
income and the net undivided profits from the previous two years. The dividends received
from the Bank are used primarily for dividends to the shareholders. In the event the
Company subsequently expands its current operations, in addition to dividends from the
Bank, it will need to rely on its own earnings, additional capital raised and other
borrowings to meet liquidity needs. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Bank&#146;s most liquid assets
are cash and cash equivalents, securities available for sale and securities held to
maturity due within one year. The levels of these assets are dependent upon the
Bank&#146;s operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given
period. Other sources of liquidity include loan and security principal repayments and
maturities, growth in the core deposit base, and lines of credit with other financial
institutions including the Federal Home Loan Bank. While scheduled loan amortization,
maturing securities and short-term investments are a relatively predictable source of
funds, deposit flows and asset prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest
rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank adjusts its liquidity levels as
appropriate to meet funding needs such as deposit outflows, loans, asset and liability
objectives and suggested O.C.C. measurements such as loan to capital ratios. Historically,
the Bank has relied on its deposit base, drawn from its market area through its branch
offices, as its principal source of funding. Although the Bank seeks to retain existing
deposits and maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive
interest rates to its customers, the Bank also strives to manage the overall cost of the
funds needed to finance its strategies. At December 31, 2002, the Bank had aggregate lines
of credit of $37,000,000 with unaffiliated correspondent banks to provide short-term
credit for liquidity requirements. Of these aggregate lines of credit, $17,000,000 is
available on an unsecured basis; as of December 31, 2002, the Bank had $4,300,000 in such
borrowings outstanding. The Bank also has the ability, as a member of the Federal Home
Loan Bank (&#147;FHLB&#148;) system, to borrow against its unencumbered residential
mortgages owned by the Bank. At December 31, 2002, the Bank was borrowing $8,000,000 from
the FHLB. The Bank also has a master repurchase agreement with the FHLB, which further
increased its borrowing capacity. In addition, the Bank has an approved broker
relationship for the purpose of issuing brokered certificates of deposit under its
contingency funding plan. The Bank does not anticipate the need to borrow under the master
repurchase agreement or brokered certificates of deposit in the near future. </FONT></P>

and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which
require the measurements of financial position and operating results in historical
dollars, or current value, without considering the changes in the relative purchasing
power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the
increased costs of the Company&#146;s operations. Unlike industrial companies, nearly all
the assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest
rates have a greater impact on the Company&#146;s performance than do the effects of
general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Significant increases in the level of
market interest rates may adversely affect the fair value of securities and other interest
earning assets. At December 31, 2002, $190,383,000 or 98.0% of the Company&#146;s
securities had fixed interest rates. Generally, the value of fixed rate instruments
fluctuates inversely with the changes in interest rates. As a result, increases in
interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest earning assets,
which could adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations if sold or, in the
case of interest earning assets classified as available for sale, the Company&#146;s
stockholders&#146; equity if retained. Increases in market interest rates also could
affect the type (fixed-rate or adjustable-rate) and amount of loans originated by the
Company and the average life of loans and securities, which can impact the yields earned
on the Company&#146;s loans and securities. In periods of decreasing interest rates, the
average life of loans held by the Company may be shortened to the extent increased
prepayment activity occurs during such periods which, in turn, may result in the
investment of funds from such prepayments in lower yielding assets. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Company utilizes the results of a
detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure to net interest
income to sustained interest rate changes. Management routinely monitors simulated net
interest income sensitivity over a rolling two-year horizon. The simulation model captures
the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and the interest
expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the Company&#146;s Statement of
Condition. This sensitivity analysis is compared to the asset and liability policy limits
that specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year
horizon given both a 200 basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates. Because
of the current historically low rate environment, the simulation modeled was a 100 basis
point shift downward at December 31, 2002. A parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a
twelve-month period is assumed. The following reflects the Company&#146;s net interest

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The preceding sensitivity analysis
does not represent a Company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of
expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous
assumptions including, but not limited to, the nature and timing of interest rate levels
and yield curve shapes, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing
decisions on loans and deposits, and reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability
cash flows. While assumptions are developed based upon perceived current economic and
local market conditions, the Company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive
nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences
may change. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Also, as market conditions vary from
those assumed in the sensitivity analysis, actual results will also differ due to
prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed, the varying impact
of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets, the potential effect of
changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans, depositor early
withdrawals and product preference changes and other internal and external variables.
Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take
in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates. </FONT></P>

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</B> </FONT> </P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December

          SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the
&#147;Company&#148;) is chartered by the State of New York as a single bank holding
company. The Company&#146;s business currently consists of the operations of its
wholly-owned subsidiary, The Bridgehampton National Bank (the &#147;Bank&#148;). The Bank
includes its real estate investment trust subsidiary, Bridgehampton Community, Inc. and a
financial subsidiary, Bridgehampton Abstract Holding, LLC, which has a majority investment
in Bridge Abstract, LLC. The accounting and reporting policies of the Bank conform to
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general
practices within the financial institution industry. The following is a description of the
significant accounting policies that the Company follows in preparing its Consolidated
Financial Statements. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">a) Basis of Financial
Statement Presentation </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting and include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. All material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The preparation of financial
statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of each consolidated statement of condition and the related
consolidated statement of income for the years then ended. Future results could differ
from those estimates. The allowance for loan losses, fair values of financial instruments,
and stock options are particularly subject to change. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">b) Cash and Cash
Equivalents </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">For purposes of reporting cash flows,
cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks and federal funds
sold, which mature overnight. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">c) Investment in Debt and
Equity Securities </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Company is required to report
readily-marketable equity and debt securities in one of the following categories: (i)
&#147;held-to-maturity&#148; (management has a positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity) which are to be reported at amortized cost; (ii) &#147;trading&#148; (held for
current resale) which are to be reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
included in earnings; and (iii) &#147;available for sale&#148; (all other debt and
marketable equity securities), which are to be reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses reported net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive income, a
separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Premiums and discounts on investment
in debt and equity securities are amortized to expense and accreted to income over the
estimated life of the respective securities using the interest method. Gains and losses on
the sales of securities are recognized upon realization based on the specific
identification method. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">d) Loans and Loan
Interest Income Recognition </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Loans are stated at unpaid principal
balances, less net deferred origination and commitment fees. Loan origination and
commitment fees and certain direct costs incurred in connection with loan originations are
deferred and amortized to income over the life of the related loans as an adjustment to
yield. When a loan prepays, the remaining unamortized fee is taken into income. Interest
on loans is credited to income based on the principal outstanding during the period. Loans
that are 90 days past due are placed on a nonaccrual basis. Exceptions to this policy are
loans that are fully and adequately secured and are in the process of collection. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">e) Allowance for Loan
Losses </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Bank monitors its portfolio on a
regular basis, with consideration given to the detailed analysis of classified loans,
delinquency trends, probable incurred losses, past loss experience, current economic
conditions, concentrations of credit, and input from the Bank&#146;s outside loan review
consultants. Additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses, net of
recoveries, are charged to the allowance. Based on management&#146;s and the Loan
Classification Committee&#146;s determination of the condition of the portfolio, the
overall level of reserves is periodically adjusted to account for the inherent and
specific risks within the entire portfolio. At a minimum, the adequacy of these reserves
are adjusted quarterly, to a level deemed appropriate by management based on their risk
assessment of the entire portfolio. Based on the Loan Classification Committee&#146;s
review of the classified loans and the overall reserve levels as they relate to the entire
loan portfolio at the year ended December 31, 2002, management believes the allowance for
loan losses is adequate. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">A valuation allowance is established
on impaired loans to reflect the difference, if any, between face amount of the loan and
the present value of expected future cash flow discounted at the loan&#146;s effective
interest rate, or as a practical expedient, at the loan&#146;s observable market price or
the fair value of the collateral. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">While management uses available
information to recognize losses on loans, future adjustments to the allowance may be
necessary based on changes in conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an
integral part of the examination process, periodically review the Bank&#146;s allowance
for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize adjustments to the
allowance based on their judgments pertaining to information available to them at the time
of their examination. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">f) Banking Premises and
Equipment </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Banking premises and equipment are
recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided for in amounts sufficient to
relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives
(fifty years for buildings and two to ten years for equipment, furniture and fixtures) on
a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the
respective leases or the service lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Improvements and major repairs are
capitalized, while the cost of ordinary maintenance, repairs and minor improvements is
charged to operations. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">g) Other Real Estate Owned </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Other real estate owned consists of
real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and is recorded at the
lower of the net unpaid principal balance at the foreclosure date plus acquisition costs
or fair value. Subsequent valuation adjustments are made if fair value less estimated
costs to sell the property falls below the carrying amount. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
the Company carried no other real estate owned. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">h) Income Taxes </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">The Company follows the asset and
liability approach, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates.
Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that a future benefit
will be realized. It is management&#146;s position, as currently supported by the facts
and circumstances, that no valuation allowance is necessary against any of the
Company&#146;s deferred tax assets. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">i) Treasury Stock </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Repurchases of common stock are
recorded as treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock is reissued using the first in, first
out method. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">j) Earnings Per Share </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Diluted earnings per share, which
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options were
exercised and if stock awards were fully vested and resulted in the issuance of common
stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company, is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares and common stock equivalents. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">k) Dividends </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">Cash available for dividend
distribution to shareholders of the Company must initially come from dividends paid by the
Bank to the Company. The approval of the Regional Administrator of National Banks is
required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds
the total of the Bank&#146;s net income of that year combined with its retained net income
of the preceding two years. The Bank had approximately $11,656,000 available as of
December 31, 2002, which may be paid to the Company as a dividend. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Head Left" FSL="Default" -->
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">l) Segment Reporting </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">SFAS No. 131, &#147;Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information&#148; requires public companies to
report certain financial information about significant revenue producing segments of the
business for which such information is available and utilized by the chief operating
decision maker. Specific information to be reported for individual operating segments
includes a measure of profit and loss, certain revenue and expense items, and total
assets. As a community-oriented financial institution, substantially all of the
Company&#146;s operations involve the delivery of loan and deposit products to customers.
Management makes operating decisions and assesses performance based on an ongoing review
of these community banking operations, which constitute the Company&#146;s only operating
segment for financial reporting purposes under SFAS No. 131. </FONT></P>

Compensation Plans </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">SFAS No. 123, &#147;Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,&#148; encourages, but does not require companies to record
compensation cost for stock-based compensation plans at fair value. The Company continues
to account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board (&#147;APB&#148;) Opinion No. 25, &#147;Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees.&#148; </FONT></P>

income and all other changes in equity during a period except those resulting from
investments by owners and distributions to owners. Other comprehensive income includes
revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles

and accumulated other comprehensive income are reported net of related income taxes.
Accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company includes unrealized holding gains

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE="2">During 1996, the Bridge Bancorp, Inc.
Equity Incentive Plan was approved by the shareholders to provide for the grant of options
to purchase up to a total of 432,000 shares of common stock of the Company and for the
award of shares of common stock as a bonus. During 2001, a plan amendment to cover
non-employee directors was adopted by the shareholders. During the years ended December
31, 2002 and 2001, the Company granted restricted stock awards of 4,950 and 5,553 shares,
respectively. These awards vest over three years on the anniversary date of the awards.
Such shares are subject to restrictions based on continued service as employees of the
Company or subsidiaries of the Company. Compensation expense attributable to these awards
was approximately $89,000, $51,000 and $35,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines
options awarded under the plan. The Company accounts for this plan under APB Opinion No.
25, under which no compensation cost has been recognized for stock options granted. Stock
options are immediately exercisable. </FONT></P>

guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank&#146;s assets, liabilities, and
certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The
