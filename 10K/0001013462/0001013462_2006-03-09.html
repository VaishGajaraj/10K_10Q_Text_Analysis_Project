Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is required for many industry applications such as biomedical (e.g. elastic artery modeling for stent design), aerofoil flutter and civil engineering (e.g. wind loading of structures). The ANSYS Fluid Structure
Interaction solution consists of two levels of fluid-structure coupling: basic FSI and advanced FSI. Basic FSI consists of entry level coupling between structural, electromagnetic and fluids suitable for steady state analysis. The coupling is file
based, uni-directional and involves using the result of one simulation as a load or boundary condition for a second simulation. Advanced FSI uses the ANSYS Multi-field&#153; solver to provide a true bi-directional FSI capability for time transient
or steady state analysis with moving / deforming geometry. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%; text-indent:-2%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><U>ANSYS Meshing Solutions </U></FONT></P> <P

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>COMPETITION </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The
Company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use, breadth and depth of functionality, flexibility, quality, ease of integration with other software systems, file compatibility across computer platforms,
range of supported computer platforms, performance, price and cost of ownership, customer service and support, company reputation and financial viability, and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts. Although the Company believes that it
currently performs effectively with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to perform effectively with respect to all or any of these factors. There also can be no assurance that other software
suppliers and customers will not develop their own software, or acquire software from suppliers other than the Company, or otherwise discontinue their relationships with the Company. If any of these events occur, the Company&#146;s business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company continues to experience intense competition
across all markets for its products and services. Some of the Company&#146;s current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some have well established relationships with
current and potential customers of the Company. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income. </FONT></P> <P

proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products. The Company
distributes its software under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses for the use of the Company&#146;s products, which are typically nontransferable. License agreements for the Company&#146;s products are directly
between the Company and end users. Use of the licensed software is restricted to designated computers at specified sites, unless the customer obtains a multi-site license for its use of the software. Software security measures are also employed to
prevent unauthorized use of the Company&#146;s software and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction of the software. Customers may either purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the
right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance, technical support and updates, or may lease the product on an annual basis for a fee which includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">For certain software products, the Company primarily relies on &#147;click-wrapped&#148; licenses. The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some
jurisdictions is uncertain. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work. The
Company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ANSYS, CFX, DesignSpace, and AUTODYN in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Additionally, the Company was awarded a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its Web-based
reporting technology and has a patent pending for its simulation wizard technology. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Employees of the Company have signed covenant agreements under which
they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information, and where legally permitted, which restrict engagement in or connection with any business which is competitive with the Company anywhere in the world, while employed by the
Company (and, in some cases, for specified periods thereafter), and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the Company. In addition, the Company requires all channel partners and resellers
to enter into agreements not to disclose the Company&#146;s trade secrets and other proprietary information. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Despite these precautions, there can be no
assurance that misappropriation of the Company&#146;s technology will not occur. Further, there can be no assurance that copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret protection will be available for the Company&#146;s products in certain countries,
or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the Company will be enforceable. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The
software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, the Company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name
recognition and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of its technology which may be available. </FONT></P> <P

no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim in the future such infringement by the Company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products. The Company expects that software product developers will increasingly
be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors continue to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause
product shipment delays or require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company. </FONT></P> <P

SIZE="2">The Company cautions investors that its performance (and, therefore, any forward-looking statement) is subject to risks and uncertainties. Various important factors including, but not limited to, the following may cause the Company&#146;s
future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Potential Fluctuations in Operating Results. </I></B>The
Company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results. Fluctuations may be caused by many factors, including the timing of new product releases or product enhancements by the Company or its competitors; the size and
timing of individual orders, including a fluctuation in the demand for and the ability to complete large contracts; software errors or other product quality problems; competition and pricing changes; customer order deferrals in anticipation of new
products or product enhancements; changes in demand for the Company&#146;s products; changes in operating expenses; changes in the mix of software license and maintenance and service revenue; personnel changes; and general economic conditions. A
substantial portion of the Company&#146;s operating expenses is related to personnel, facilities and marketing programs. The level of personnel and related expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is based, in significant part, on the Company&#146;s
expectation for future revenue. The Company does not typically experience significant order backlog. Further, the Company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of a quarter, with this revenue frequently
concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter. During certain quarterly periods, the Company has been dependent upon receiving large orders of perpetual licenses involving the payment of a single up-front fee and, more recently, has shifted
the business emphasis of its products to provide a collaborative solution to the Company&#146;s customers. This emphasis has increased the Company&#146;s average order size and increased the related sales cycle time for the larger orders. This shift
may have the effect of increasing the volatility of the Company&#146;s revenue and profit from period to period. As a result, product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent upon sales completed in the latter part of that quarter, and
revenue for any future quarter is not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Seasonal Variations.</I></B> The Company&#146;s business

</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Economic Slowdown in Certain Sectors.</I></B> The Company&#146;s sales are based significantly on end user demand for products in key industrial
sectors. Many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines. These economic declines may be exacerbated by other economic factors, such as the recent increase in global energy prices. These economic factors may adversely affect the
Company&#146;s business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company has customers who supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in
virtually all of the world&#146;s major economic regions. The Company&#146;s performance is materially impacted by general economic conditions and the performance of its customers. The Company&#146;s management team forecasts macroeconomic trends
and developments and integrates them through long-range planning into budgets, research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties. When forecasting future economic trends and technological developments, management
does not have a comparative advantage. To the extent that the Company&#146;s forecasts are in error by being overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about the performance of an economy or sector, the Company&#146;s performance may be hindered
because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Terrorist attacks, other increased global hostilities and natural
disasters have, at times, contributed to widespread uncertainty and speculation in the world financial markets. This uncertainty and speculation may result in further economic contraction, resulting in the suspension or delay of purchasing by the
Company&#146;s customers. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Stock Market and Stock Price Volatility.</I></B> Market prices for securities of software companies have generally been
volatile. In particular, the market price of the Company&#146;s common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the Company, the software industry or the securities markets in
general. Such factors include, but are not limited to, declines in trading price that may be triggered by the Company&#146;s failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors. The Company cannot provide assurance that in such
circumstances the trading price of the Company&#146;s common stock will recover or that it will not experience a further decline. Moreover, the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in
the Company&#146;s operating results, material announcements made by the Company or its competitors, conditions in the software industry generally or other events and factors, many of which are beyond the Company&#146;s control. </FONT></P> <P

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Rapidly Changing Technology; New Products; Risk of Product Defects. </I></B>The Company operates in an industry
generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions that can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable. A major factor in the Company&#146;s future success will be its ability to anticipate
technological changes and to develop and introduce, in a timely manner, enhancements to its existing products and new products to meet those changes. If the Company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes, its
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The introduction and marketing of new or
enhanced products require the Company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in developing and marketing, on a
timely basis, new products or product enhancements, that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products. Software products as complex as those
offered by the Company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released, and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the Company&#146;s commitment to accelerating the frequency of its
product releases. There can be no assurance that errors will not be found in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments. Any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance, diversion of
development resources, damage to the Company&#146;s reputation or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Sales of New Products.</I></B> The Company continues to develop and introduce new software products. Certain of these products require a higher
level of sales and support expertise. The ability of the Company&#146;s sales channel, particularly the indirect channel, to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an impact on the Company&#146;s sales in
future periods. Additionally, royalties and engineering service engagements associated with the new software products may result in the Company&#146;s cost of sales increasing as a percentage of revenue in future periods. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Dependence on Channel Partners.</I></B> The Company continues to distribute a substantial portion of its products through its global network of independent,
regional channel partners. The channel partners sell the Company&#146;s software products to new and existing customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical
support. Consequently, the Company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners. Difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners, such as delays in collecting accounts receivable, failure to meet performance criteria or
to promote the Company&#146;s products as aggressively as the Company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the Company&#146;s performance. Additionally, the loss of any major channel partner for
any reason, including a channel partner&#146;s decision to sell competing products rather than the Company&#146;s products, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Moreover, the Company&#146;s future success will depend substantially on
the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the Company&#146;s products and to support a larger installed base of the Company&#146;s products. If the channel partners are unable or
unwilling to do so, the Company may be unable to sustain revenue growth. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Currently the Company is partially protected from exchange rate fluctuations
among the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar and other currencies as a result of its indirect sales channel, which generally pays the Company in U.S. Dollars. The revenues and expenses associated with the Company&#146;s international direct sales channel are subject
to foreign currency exchange fluctuations and, as a result, the Company&#146;s future financial results may be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. Additionally, any future changes to the Company&#146;s sales channel involving proportionally
higher direct sales from international locations could result in additional exposure to the foreign currency exchange fluctuations. This exposure could adversely impact the Company&#146;s financial position and results of operations in future
periods. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Competition.</I></B> The Company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services. Some of the
Company&#146;s current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than the Company, and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the Company. These
competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

employees, could adversely affect the Company&#146;s ability to conduct its operations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Risks Associated with International Activities.</I></B> A
majority of the Company&#146;s business comes from outside the United States of America. Risks inherent in the Company&#146;s international business activities include imposition of government controls, export license requirements, restrictions on
the export of critical technology, products and services, political and economic instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and taxes, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, longer accounts receivable payment cycles
and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations. Effective patent, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the Company sells its products and services. The
Company&#146;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As the
Company continues to expand its direct sales presence in international regions, the portion of its revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase. As a result, changes in
currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Additionally, countries
in certain international regions have continued to experience weaknesses in their currency, banking and equity markets. These weaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for the Company&#146;s products and ultimately the Company&#146;s
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As the Company has grown, it has become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse
changes in domestic and global economic conditions. As a result of the current economic slowdown, many companies are delaying or reducing technology purchases, which has had an impact on the Company&#146;s visibility into the closing of new
business, as opposed to its recurring business. This slowdown has also contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, reductions in sales, longer sales cycles and increased price pressure. Each of these items could adversely affect the
Company&#146;s sales in future periods. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company has historically received significant tax benefits related to its export activities. In October 2004,
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law and included replacement legislation for existing export benefits. This bill retains certain export benefits for transactions in the ordinary course of business under binding contracts with

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In 2005, export benefits reduced the Company&#146;s effective tax rate by approximately 2.9%. The impact of the above
legislation on the Company&#146;s effective tax rate in 2005 was not significant. The Company expects the above legislation to adversely impact the effective tax rate by 1.0% in 2006. Any other prospective changes regarding tax benefits associated
with the Company&#146;s export sales or other federal and state tax planning vehicles may adversely impact the Company&#146;s effective tax rate and decrease its net income in future periods. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Dependence on Proprietary Technology. </I></B>The Company&#146;s success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology. Although the Company was awarded a
patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for its Web-based reporting technology, the Company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright and trade secrets to protect its technology. Although the Company maintains a trade secrets
program, enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and distributors, and limits access to and distribution of its software, documentation and other proprietary information, there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the
Company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties, or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently. Although the Company is not aware that
any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the Company or that, if asserted, such claims will not prevail. </FONT></P> <P

licenses, software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties, it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single up-front fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry. While revenue
generated from software lease licenses, software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties currently represents a portion of the Company&#146;s software license revenue, to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a
significant percentage of total software license revenue, the Company&#146;s revenue in any period will depend increasingly on sales completed during that period. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"

commercially acceptable terms. Business acquisitions may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources. The ability of the Company to integrate the acquired businesses, including delivering sales and support, ensuring
continued customer commitment, obtaining further commitments and challenges associated with expanding sales in particular markets and retaining key personnel, will impact the success of these acquisitions. If the Company is unable to properly and

the United States, Canada and Europe. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the Company&#146;s operations, services and product development activities.
Additionally, if the Company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure, such as a computer virus, telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party, these interruptions
could have a material, adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting timelines. Further, because the Company&#146;s sales are not generally linear
during any quarterly period, the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the Company&#146;s business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Periodic Reorganization of Sales Force.</I></B> The Company relies heavily on its direct sales force. From time to time, the Company reorganizes and makes
adjustments to its sales force in response to such factors as management changes, performance issues, market opportunities and other considerations. These changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in
future quarters. There can be no assurance that the Company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not recur. </FONT></P> <P

additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the day-to-day operations of the Company. While the Company anticipates being able to fully comply with these internal control requirements, if it is not able to comply with the

export control laws of the United States, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and a variety of other laws and regulations of the United States of America and other countries in which the Company operates. Failure to comply with any of these laws and

Company is involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. These proceedings currently include customary audit activities by various taxing authorities.

investments. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, total interest income was $4.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as time deposits held at major banks, money market mutual funds and other
securities with remaining maturities of three months or less. The Company considers investments backed by government agencies or U.S. financial institutions to be highly liquid and, accordingly, classifies such investments as short-term investments.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Foreign Currency Transaction Risk.</I></B> As the Company continues to expand its direct sales presence in international regions, the portion of its
revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the Company&#146;s financial position, results
of operations and cash flows. On average, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005, the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar was 0.5% stronger, when measured against the Company&#146;s primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. The
U.S.&nbsp;Dollar strengthened against the British Pound, the Japanese Yen and the Euro while it weakened against the Indian Rupee and the Canadian Dollar. As a result of these fluctuations, the net adverse impact on revenue and operating income
during 2005, as compared with 2004, was $300,000 and $600,000, respectively. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%; text-indent:-2%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Based on the nature of the Company&#146;s

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company believes, based on its knowledge, that the financial statements and other financial information included in
this report fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this report. The Company cannot provide assurance that new problems will not be
found in the future, nor does it expect that its disclosure controls and procedures, or its internal controls, will prevent all errors and all fraud because no system can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud within ANSYS have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some person or by collusion of two or more people. The Company is
committed to both a sound internal control environment and to good corporate governance. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">From time to time, the Company reviews the disclosure controls
and procedures, and may make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the Company&#146;s systems evolve with its business. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As of
the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed of the effectiveness of the design and operation of ANSYS&#146; disclosure controls and procedures by the Company. Based on that evaluation, the Company has concluded that its
disclosure controls and procedures are effective. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.</I></B> The Company&#146;s management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company&#146;s management,
including the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based upon the Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting was effective at December&nbsp;31, 2005. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal controls over

over financial reporting. The report is included in Item&nbsp;8 of this Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B><I>Changes in Internal Controls.</I></B>&nbsp;There were no
