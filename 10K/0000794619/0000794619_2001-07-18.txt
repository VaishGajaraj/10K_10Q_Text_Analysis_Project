                                    PART I

Item 1.       BUSINESS

              American Woodmark Corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen
              cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction
              markets. American Woodmark was formed in 1980 by the four
              principal managers of the Boise Cascade Cabinet Division through a
              leveraged buyout of that division. American Woodmark was operated
              privately until 1986 when it became a public company through a
              registered public offering of our common stock.

              American Woodmark currently offers framed stock cabinets in
              approximately 150 different cabinet lines, ranging in price from
              relatively inexpensive to medium-priced styles. Styles vary by
              design and color from natural wood finishes to low-pressure
              laminate surfaces. The product offering of stock cabinets includes
              approximately 50 door designs in seven colors. Stock cabinets
              consist of a common box with standard interior components and an
              oak, cherry, maple or hickory front frame. In May of 2000 the
              Company announced the discontinuation of our custom line of
              cabinets in order to allow for focus on revenue growth in our core
              product lines.

              Products are sold under the brand names of American Woodmark(R),
              Thomasville Cabinetry(TM), Timberlake(R), and Shenandoah
              Cabinetry(R).

              American Woodmark's products are sold on a national basis across
              the United States through three primary market channels:
              independent dealer/ distributors, home centers and major builders.
              We distribute our products to each market channel directly from
              our four assembly plants and through a logistics network
              consisting of nine service centers located in key areas throughout
              the United States.

              The primary raw materials we use include oak, maple, cherry and
              hickory lumber. Additional raw materials include paint,
              particleboard, manufactured components and hardware. We currently
              purchase paint from one supplier; however, other sources are
              available. Our other raw materials are purchased from more than
              one source and are readily available.

              American Woodmark operates in a highly fragmented industry that is
              composed of several thousand local, regional and national
              manufacturers. Our principal means for competition rely on our
              breadth and variety of product offering, expanded service
              capabilities and affordable quality. We believe that no other
              company in the industry has more than a 20% share of the market.
              We also believe that American Woodmark is one of the five largest
              manufacturers of kitchen cabinets in the United States.

              American Woodmark's business has historically been subjected to
              seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the
              second and fourth fiscal quarters. General economic

                                       2
<PAGE>

                  forces and changes in our customer mix have reduced seasonal
                  fluctuations in our revenue over the past few years.

                  During the last fiscal year, American Woodmark had two
                  customers, The Home Depot and Lowe's Companies, Inc., which
                  each accounted for more than 10% of our sales. The loss of
                  either would have a material adverse effect on American
                  Woodmark.

                  As of April 30, 2001, we had 3,866 employees. Approximately
                  24% of our employees are represented by labor unions. We
                  believe that our employee relations are good.

Item 2.           PROPERTIES

                  We lease our Corporate Office which is located in Winchester,
                  Virginia. In addition, we lease one and own ten manufacturing
                  facilities located primarily in the eastern United States. We
                  also lease nine service centers and three office centers
                  located throughout the United States that support the sale and
                  distribution of products to each market channel.

                  Primary properties include:
