<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We are a blank check company
incorporated on April 7, 2017 as a Delaware corporation. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital
stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the
&ldquo;business combination&rdquo;). We are currently in the process of locating suitable targets for our business combination.
Although we are not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a business combination, we intend to
focus our search on manufacturing and service companies in the industrial sector. We have neither engaged in any operations nor
generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a &ldquo;shell company&rdquo; as defined under
the Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely
of cash.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 15pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">On August 1, 2017, we consummated
our initial public offering (the &ldquo;initial public offering&rdquo;) of 23,000,000 units (the &ldquo;units&rdquo;), including
the issuance of 3,000,000 units as a result of the underwriters&rsquo; exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit
consists of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 (&ldquo;Class A common stock&rdquo; and, with respect to the shares
of Class A common stock included in the units offered, the &ldquo;public shares&rdquo;) and one redeemable warrant. Each warrant
entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at
an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $230 million.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 15pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Simultaneously with the
closing of the initial public offering, we issued to the Sponsor 11,100,000 warrants (the &ldquo;private placement warrants&rdquo;),
each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per private
placement warrant, in a private placement (&ldquo;private placement&rdquo;), generating gross proceeds of $11.1 million. On August
22, 2017, the Sponsor sold 55,500 private placement warrants at their original purchase price to each of the Company&rsquo;s five
independent directors, or an aggregate of 277,500 private placement warrants for $277,500.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 15pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Prior to the consummation
of the initial public offering, on April 10, 2017, the Sponsor purchased 5,750,000 shares (the &ldquo;founder shares&rdquo;) of
our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 (&ldquo;Class B common stock&rdquo;), for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. In
April and May 2017, the Sponsor transferred a total of 28,750 founder shares to each of our five independent director nominees
at their original purchase price.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 15pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Upon the closing of the
initial public offering and private placement, $234.6 million ($10.20 per unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the units in
the Initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, acting as trustee (&ldquo;trust account&rdquo;). The proceeds held
in the trust account were invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, amended (the &ldquo;Investment Company Act&rdquo;), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended
investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2),
(d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion
of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the trust account as described below.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">As of December 31, 2017,
we had approximately $829,000 in our operating bank account, approximately $595,000 of interest available to pay for franchise
and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) and working capital of approximately $378,000. As
of December 31, 2017, an aggregate of $340,000 had been withdrawn from the trust account to pay taxes.</P>

in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination
using cash held in the trust account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration. We may seek to complete
our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development
or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.</P>

of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we
may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance

completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 27.5pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">While we may pursue an
initial business combination target in any industry or sector, we intend to focus our search on manufacturing and service companies
in the industrial sector. Our management team and board of directors have extensive experience in acquiring and operating similar
companies in these industries. We believe this experience makes us well situated to identify, source, negotiate and execute an
initial business combination with an attractive industrial manufacturing or services company. Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation prohibits us from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with
nominal operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.3pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Nasdaq rules require that
we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets
held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust
account) at the time of the signing of a definitive agreement in connection with the business combination. Our board of directors
will make the determination as to the fair market value of our business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently
determine the fair market value of our business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) or an independent accounting firm with respect
to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent
determination of the fair market value of our business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced
with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target&rsquo;s
assets or prospects.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 13.2pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We may, at our option,
pursue an initial business combination opportunity jointly with one or more entities affiliated with Argand Partners, LP (&ldquo;Argand
Partners&rdquo;) which we refer to as an &ldquo;Affiliated Joint Acquisition.&rdquo; Any such parties would co-invest only if (i)
permitted by applicable regulatory and other legal limitations&#894; (ii) we and Argand Partners considered a transaction to be
mutually beneficial to us as well as the affiliated entity&#894; and (iii) other business reasons exist to do so, such as the strategic
merits of including such co- investors, the need for additional capital beyond the amount held in our trust account to fund the
business combination and/or the desire to obtain committed capital for closing the business combination. An Affiliated Joint Acquisition
may be effected through a co-investment with us in the target business at the time of our business combination, or we could raise
additional proceeds to complete the business combination by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities.
We refer to this potential future issuance, or a similar issuance to other specified purchasers, as a &ldquo;specified future issuance.&rdquo;
The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are
not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of
our Class B common stock, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that our
initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum
of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of our Initial public offering plus all shares issued
in the specified future issuance, unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock agreed
to waive such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether
a majority of the holders of our Class B common stock at the time of any such specified future issuance would agree to waive such
adjustment to the conversion ratio. They may waive such adjustment due to (but not limited to) the following: (i) closing conditions
which are part of the agreement for our business combination&#894; (ii) negotiation with Class A stockholders on structuring an
business combination&#894; (iii) negotiation with parties providing financing which would trigger the anti-dilution provisions
of the Class B common stock&#894; or (iv) as part of the Affiliated Joint Acquisition. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified
future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class B common stock, but would reduce the percentage
ownership of holders of our Class A common stock. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the
percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our common stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We anticipate structuring
our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders
own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way
so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order
to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition
as described above. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires
50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company
owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination
may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us
in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares
in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in
the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our
initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.
If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction
company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of
Nasdaq&rsquo;s 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets
test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">In evaluating a prospective
target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which will encompass, among other things, meetings with
incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well
as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.&nbsp;</P>

and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this
process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and
evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result
in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.</P>

from pursuing a business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors (our &ldquo;initial

they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller

of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a
target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where
it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval
in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial
business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public &ldquo;float&rdquo;
of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be
reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities
exchange.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial
business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a
public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in
concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption
rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our Initial public offering, which we refer to as the
&ldquo;Excess Shares.&rdquo; Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage
stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise
their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their
shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public
stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our Initial public offering could threaten to exercise
its redemption rights if such holder&rsquo;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current
market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares
sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">In identifying, evaluating
and selecting a target business for an initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having
a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds,
and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience
identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater
financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by
our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business.
Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce
the resources available to us for our business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially
represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage
in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.</P>

pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash
in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares
are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion
of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive
equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our ability
to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred
underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an
initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights
will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming
stockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions.</P>

allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity,
then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having
used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho,
certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these
powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq,
our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities,

including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors
in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules.
Among other things, this means that we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies

However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for

indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess
greater technical, human and other resources or more industry knowledge than we do, and our financial resources will be relatively
limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could
potentially acquire, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will
be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, because we are obligated to pay cash for the shares of Class A common stock
which our public stockholders redeem in connection with our initial business combination, target companies will be aware that this

these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other
charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected
risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even
though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of
this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may

that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations,

shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of
a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of
creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share
redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.20 per share initially held in the trust account,
due to claims of such creditors. Our Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party
for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter

upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from
the closing of the initial public offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If a corporation complies
with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims
against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day
period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating
distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to
the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability
of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public
shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 24<SUP>th</SUP> month from the closing of the initial public offering in the
event we do not complete our initial business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the foregoing procedures.</P>

payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our
dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited
to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers,
investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL,
any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro
rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred
after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially
brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received
by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore,
if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in
the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering
is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then
pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful
redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution.</P>

our initial business combination, warrantholders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement, exercise
warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Second, if our Class
A common stock is at any time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies
the definition of a &ldquo;covered security&rdquo; under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require

would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the

by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; (as defined in the next sentence)

the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, you would

The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse
effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial
business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase

combination with manufacturing and service companies in the industrial sector but may also pursue business combination opportunities
in other industries, except that we will not, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, be permitted to effectuate
our initial business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not
yet selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the
possible merits or risks of any particular target business&rsquo;s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial
condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent
in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity
lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of
a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent
in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors
or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and
leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot
assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if
such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders
following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders are unlikely
to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach
by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring
a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business
combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.</P>

we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with
the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping
them become familiar with such requirements. In addition, the officers and directors of an initial business combination candidate
may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The departure of an initial business combination target&rsquo;s
key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an initial
business combination candidate&rsquo;s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained
at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an initial business combination candidate&rsquo;s management team
will remain associated with the initial business combination candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible
that members of the management of an initial business combination candidate will not wish to remain in place. The loss of key personnel
could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.</P>

all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of the initial public offering plus all shares issued in the specified future

our Sponsor transferred 28,750 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at their original purchase price. The
number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding

In addition, our Sponsor has committed 11,100,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable for one share of our Class A common

so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests

50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction
that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target,
our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination
company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue
a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of
a substantial number of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than
a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may
subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&rsquo;s stock
than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control
of the target business. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess
the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.</P>

statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules.
These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to
be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial
statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide
such financial statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We are an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo;
within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &ldquo;JOBS Act&rdquo;),
and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation
and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access
to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances
could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds
$700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following
December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions.
If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our
securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading
prices of our securities may be more volatile.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts
emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies
(that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities
registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act
provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging
growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition
period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies,
we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised
standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth
company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because
of the potential differences in accountant standards used.</P>

to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial
reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent
registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are
a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared
to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in
compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal
control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete

April 7, 2017 as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock
purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Although we are not limited to a particular
industry or sector for purposes of consummating an initial business combination, we intend to focus on manufacturing and service
companies in the industrial sector. Our sponsor is Industrea Alexandria LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The registration statement for our initial
public offering was declared effective on July 26, 2017. On August 1, 2017, we consummated the initial public offering of 23,000,000
units, including the issuance of 3,000,000 units as a result of the underwriters&rsquo; exercise of their over-allotment option
in full at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $230 million. We incurred offering costs of $13.3 million, inclusive of
$8.05 million in deferred underwriting commissions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Simultaneously with the closing of the initial
public offering, we consummated the private placement of 11,100,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private
placement warrant with our Sponsor generating gross proceeds of approximately $11.1 million.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">On August 22, 2017, the Sponsor sold 55,500

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Prior to the consummation of the initial public
offering, on April 10, 2017, the Sponsor purchased 5,750,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. In April
and May 2017, the Sponsor transferred a total of 28,750 founder shares to each of our five independent director nominees at their
original purchase price.</P>

and private placement, $234.6 million from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the initial public offering and the private
placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer&nbsp;&amp; Trust Company, acting as
trustee. The funds in the trust account were invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16)
of the Investment Company Act, with maturities of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out
as a money market fund meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act,
as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of an initial business combination and (ii) the distribution of the
funds in the trust account.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">As indicated in the accompanying
financial statements, at December 31, 2017, we had approximately $829,000 in our operating bank account, approximately $595,000
of interest available to pay for franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) and working
capital of approximately $378,000. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our initial business combination
plans.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Through December 31, 2017,
our liquidity needs have been satisfied through receipt of a $25,000 capital contribution from the Sponsor in exchange for the
issuance of the founder shares to the Sponsor, $224,403 in loans from the Sponsor, and the proceeds from the consummation of the
private placement not held in trust account. We repaid such loans from the Sponsor in full on August 1, 2017.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We intend to use substantially all of the funds
held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account holding the net proceeds of
the initial public offering (less taxes payable and deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial business combination.
To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination,
the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business
or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.</P>

capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our Sponsor or an
affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required.
If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants
of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical
to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with
respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties
other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and
provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.25in">Based on the foregoing,
we believe that we will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity from the Sponsor to meet our needs through the earlier
of the consummation of an initial business combination or December 31, 2018. Over this time period, we will be using these funds
for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial business combination candidates, performing
due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business, and structuring,
negotiating and consummating the initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.25in">In February 2018, we entered
into an expense reimbursement agreement (the &ldquo;Reimbursement Agreement&rdquo;) with the sellers of a potential business combination
target (the &ldquo;Sellers&rdquo;).&nbsp; Discussions regarding the proposed transaction were terminated in February 2018.&nbsp;
Pursuant to the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, the Sellers agreed to reimburse us for fees incurred, in connection with
the transaction, from December 19, 2017 and through the date of termination.&nbsp; During the first quarter of 2018, we received
$1,275,067  from the Sellers as the final settlement of amounts owed under the Reimbursement Agreement.&nbsp; Any remaining
unreimbursed expenses will be financed with Company proceeds held outside of the trust account or with a working capital loan from
the Sponsor.</P>

public offering,&nbsp;the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 11,100,000 private placement warrants at $1.00 per private placement
warrant, generating gross proceeds of $11.1 million in the aggregate. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase
one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants
was added to the proceeds from the initial public offering to be held in the trust account. If we do not complete an initial business
combination within the Combination Period, the private placement warrants will expire worthless.</P>

costs in connection with an initial business combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers

an initial business combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the trust account released
to the Company. In the event that an initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside
the trust account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the trust account would be used to repay the Working
Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of an initial business
combination, without interest, or, at the lender&rsquo;s discretion, up to $1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible
into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants.</P>

Following our initial public offering, we invested the funds held in the trust account invested in U.S. government treasury bills,
notes or bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in US treasuries. Due to
the short-term nature of these investments, we do not believe that there will be an associated material exposure to interest rate

(the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated in Delaware on April 7, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting
a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or
more businesses (the &ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo;). Although the Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector
for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, the Company intends to focus its search on manufacturing and service companies
in the industrial sector. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all
of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.25in">As of December 31, 2017,
the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from April 7, 2017 (date of inception) through December
31, 2017 relates to the Company&rsquo;s formation, the Initial Public Offering (as defined below), and search for a Business Combination.
The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest.
The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and marketable securities from the proceeds
derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.</P>

for the Company&rsquo;s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on July 26, 2017.&nbsp;On August 1, 2017, the Company consummated
its&nbsp;initial public offering (the &ldquo;Initial Public Offering&rdquo;) of 23,000,000 units (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo; and,
with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included in the Units offered, the &ldquo;Public Shares&rdquo;), including the
issuance of 3,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriters&rsquo; exercise of their over-allotment option in full, at $10.00 per
Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230 million and incurring offering costs of approximately $13.3 million, inclusive of $8.05
million in deferred underwriting commissions (Note 6).</P>

closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (&ldquo;Private Placement&rdquo;) of&nbsp;11,100,000
warrants (the &ldquo;Private Placement Warrants&rdquo;), at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, with the Company&rsquo;s
sponsor, Industrea Alexandria LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the &ldquo;Sponsor&rdquo;), generating gross proceeds
of $11.1 million. On August 22, 2017, the Sponsor sold 55,500 Private Placement Warrants at their original purchase price to each
of the Company&rsquo;s five independent directors, or an aggregate of 277,500 private placement warrants for $277,500 (Note 4).</P>

Initial Public Offering and Private Placement, $234.6 million ($10.20 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in
the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer&nbsp;&amp; Trust Company, acting as trustee (&ldquo;Trust Account&rdquo;). The funds held
in the Trust Account were and remain invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended (the &ldquo;Investment Company Act&rdquo;), with maturities of 180 days or less or
in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions
of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4)&nbsp;of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the
earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.</P>

has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of
Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination. A potential initial
Business Combinations must have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined
below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of
the agreement in order to be consummated. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction
company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest
in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.</P>

its holders of the outstanding shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 (&ldquo;Class A common stock&rdquo;), sold
in the Initial Public Offering (the &ldquo;public stockholders&rdquo;) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their
Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve
the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval
of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public stockholders
will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account. The per-share amount
to be distributed to public stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions
the Company will pay to the underwriters. These Public Shares will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary
equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board&rsquo;s (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;)
Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 480 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo; In such case,
the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation
of a Business Combination and a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote
is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company
will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the &ldquo;Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation&rdquo;),
conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) and
file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transactions
is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer
to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules.

the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds
held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay
the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.25in">In assessing the realization
of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
After consideration of all of the information available, Management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to
future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the period ended December
31, 2017, the valuation allowance was approximately $176,000.</P>

the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (&quot;Tax Reform Legislation&quot;), which made significant changes to U.S.
federal income tax law. The Corporation expects that certain aspects of the Tax Reform Legislation will positively impact the Corporation's
future after-tax earnings primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate. Beginning January 1, 2018, the Corporation's U.S.
income will be taxed at a 21 percent federal corporate rate. Further, we are required to recognize the effect of this rate change
on our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the period the tax rate change is enacted.
We do not expect any material non-cash impact from this rate change, with adjustments to deferred tax balances offset by adjustments
to deferred tax valuation allowances.</P>

the Company entered into an expense reimbursement agreement (the &ldquo;Reimbursement Agreement&rdquo;) with the sellers of a
potential business combination target (the &ldquo;Sellers&rdquo;).&nbsp; Discussions regarding the proposed transaction were
terminated in February 2018.&nbsp; Pursuant to the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, the Sellers agreed to reimburse the
Company for fees incurred, in connection with the transaction, from December 19, 2017 and through the date of
termination.&nbsp; During the first quarter of 2018, the Company received $1,275,067 from the Sellers as the final settlement
of amounts owed under the Reimbursement Agreement.&nbsp; Any remaining unreimbursed expenses will be financed with Company
proceeds held outside of the Trust Account or with a working capital loan from the Sponsor.</P>

though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or Nasdaq rules.
In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for
selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out
the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee.
The directors who will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Messrs. Armstrong, Brown, Hall,
Hodges and Rooney. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing
nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.</P>

will provide that our officers and directors will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it
now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that
our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us or our stockholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty

and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation. Our bylaws also will permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee
for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We have
purchased a policy of directors&rsquo; and officers&rsquo; liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against
the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify
our officers and directors.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.25in">These provisions may discourage stockholders
from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of
reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might
otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder&rsquo;s investment may be adversely affected to the extent
we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.25in">None of our executive officers has received
any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We have agreed to pay each of our independent directors $50,000 per year for
services rendered as board members prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Commencing July 26, 2017, have
also agreed to pay our Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support.
Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. Other than as
described above, no finder&rsquo;s fee,&nbsp;reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other
compensation, will be paid by us to our Sponsor, officers or directors, or any affiliate of our Sponsor or officers, prior to,
or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers
or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held
outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to have any additional
controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination.</P>

combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the
combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials
or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed initial business combination. We have
not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management.
It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial business combination, because
the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation
to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation
committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.</P>

that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination,
although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain
with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain
their positions with us may influence our management&rsquo;s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do
not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will
be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements
with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.</P>

of Class B common stock to the Sponsor in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. In April and May 2017, the Sponsor
transferred a total of 28,750 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at the same per-share purchase price
paid by the Sponsor. The foregoing transfers of founder shares were made in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act pursuant to the so-called 4(a)(1)-&frac12; exemption. The founder shares will automatically convert into
shares of Class A common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustments.
In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities convertible or exercisable for shares of
Class A common stock, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in our final prospectus and related to the closing
of our initial business combination, including pursuant to a specified future issuance, the ratio at which founder shares will
convert into shares of Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding founder shares
agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance, including a specified future issuance) so
that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal in the aggregate, on
an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of the
initial public offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked shares issued or deemed issued in connection
with the initial business combination (excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities issued, or to be
issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement-equivalent warrants issued to the Sponsor or
its affiliates upon conversion of loans made to us).</P>

warrant, generating gross proceeds of $11.1 million in the aggregate. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase
one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants
was added to the proceeds from the initial public offering to be held in the trust account. If we do not complete an initial business
combination within the Combination Period, the private placement warrants will expire worthless.</P>

an initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the trust account to repay the Working
Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the trust account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Except for the foregoing,
the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such
loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of an initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender&rsquo;s discretion, up to $1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the
post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants.</P>
