candidates designed to extend and enhance the quality of human life. Through the application of our
proprietary technologies, we have established a pipeline of therapeutic product development
programs in multiple disease areas. We are committed to developing therapeutic products that we
believe have best-in-class potential, meaning therapeutic candidates that have the potential to be
safer, more effective products than the current standard of care or other products in development,
and that may have other advantages, such as superior scalability or ease of administration. Our
current product development portfolio consists of MultiStem<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>, a patented and proprietary
stem cell product that we are developing as a treatment for multiple disease indications and that
is currently being evaluated in two ongoing clinical trials, and has been authorized for use in a
third clinical trial. In addition, we are developing novel pharmaceuticals to treat indications
such as obesity, certain cognitive and attention disorders, and narcolepsy or other forms of
excessive daytime sleepiness.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, to develop
and commercialize MutiStem for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, for the
worldwide market. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an up-front cash payment of $6
million from Pfizer and will receive research funding and support during the initial phase of the
collaboration. In addition, we are also eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $105
million upon the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial
milestones. We will be responsible for manufacturing and Pfizer will pay us for manufacturing
product for clinical development and commercialization purposes. Pfizer will have responsibility
for development, regulatory and commercialization and will pay us tiered royalties on worldwide
commercial sales of MultiStem IBD products. Alternatively, in lieu of royalties and certain
commercialization milestones, we may elect to co-develop with Pfizer and the parties will share
development and commercialization expenses and profits/losses on an agreed basis beginning at phase
III clinical development.

product development programs in the areas of cardiovascular disease, hematopoietic stem cell, or
HSC, transplant support and ischemic stroke, and are developing a program to treat IBD with our
partner, Pfizer. We advanced our first two MultiStem programs into clinical development in 2008 and
completed phase I enrollment in our cardiovascular trial in the first quarter of 2010. In 2010, we
intend to further advance our HSC transplant support phase I study in both the U.S. and Europe,
while we prepare for phase I clinical studies in ischemic stroke and IBD and for a potential phase
II clinical study of MultiStem for acute myocardial infarction. In addition, by applying our core
technologies and capabilities, we have established drug development programs in the areas of
obesity and central nervous system disorders involving cognition, attention and wakefulness.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing a proprietary nonembryonic, allogeneic stem cell product candidate, MultiStem,
that we believe has potential utility for treating a broad range of diseases and could have
widespread application in the field of clinical regenerative medicine. Unlike traditional bone
marrow transplants or other stem cell therapies, MultiStem may be manufactured on a large scale
(with hundreds of thousands to millions of doses obtained from a single healthy donor), and may be
administered without tissue matching or the need for immune suppression, analogous to type O blood.
Potential applications of MultiStem include the treatment of cardiovascular disease, cancer
treatment related transplant support, certain neurological conditions, autoimmune disease and other
conditions. We initiated phase I clinical trials in the areas of acute myocardial infarction, or
AMI, and HSC transplant support in 2008 and have received FDA authorization to initiate a phase I
clinical trial in the area of ischemic stroke. We believe that MultiStem represents a significant
advancement in the field of stem cell therapy and could have broad clinical application.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">MultiStem is a patented biologic product that is manufactured from human stem cells obtained from
adult bone marrow. The product consists of a special class of human stem cells that have the
ability to express a range of therapeutically relevant proteins and other factors, as well as form
multiple cell types. Factors expressed by MultiStem have the potential to deliver a therapeutic
benefit in several ways, such as the reduction of inflammation, regulation of immune system
function, protection of damaged or injured tissue, the formation of new blood vessels in regions of
ischemic injury and augmenting tissue repair and healing in other ways. These cells exhibit a
drug-like profile in that they act primarily through the production of factors that regulate the
immune system, protect damaged or injured cells, promote tissue repair and healing and most or all
of the cells are cleared from the body over time.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The therapeutic benefit of bone marrow transplantation has been recognized for decades, and its
clinical use has grown since Congress passed the National Organ Transplant Act in 1984 and the
National Marrow Donor Registry was established in 1990. However, widespread bone marrow or stem
cell transplantation has yet to become a reality.
Some of the limitations that have prevented broader clinical application of bone marrow or stem
cell transplantation include the requirement for tissue matching between donor and recipient, the
typical need for one donor for each patient (a reflection of the inability to expand cells in a
controlled and reproducible manner), frequent use of immune suppressive drugs to avoid rejection or
immune system complications, the inability to efficiently produce significant quantities of stem
cells, and a range of potential safety issues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A stem cell therapy that has the potential to address the challenges mentioned above could
represent a breakthrough in the field of regenerative medicine, since it could greatly expand the
clinical application of stem cell therapy or other forms of regenerative medicine. In 2003, we
acquired technology originally developed at the University of Minnesota related to a novel stem
cell, the Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cell, or MAPC, which may be isolated from adult bone marrow
as well as other nonembryonic tissues. Over the past several years, we have further developed this
technology and the manufacturing of these cells for use in ongoing clinical trials. Our current
product platform is referred to as MultiStem. During several years of preclinical work, MultiStem
has demonstrated the potential to address the fundamental limitations observed with traditional
bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At each step of the MultiStem production process, cells are analyzed and qualified according to
pre-established criteria to ensure that a consistent, well characterized product candidate is
produced. Cells are harvested from a pre-qualified donor and then expanded to form a Master Cell
Bank from which we produce clinical grade material. In March&nbsp;2007, we and our manufacturing
partner, Lonza Walkersville, Inc., announced the successful establishment of a Master Cell Bank
produced under Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, and the production of clinical grade material
for our initial clinical trials. In multiple animal models, MultiStem has been shown to be
non-immunogenic, and is administered without the genetic matching that is typically required for
conventional bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">MultiStem allows us to pursue multiple high value commercial opportunities from a single product
platform, because, based upon work that we and independent collaborators have conducted over the
past several years, we believe that MultiStem has the potential to treat a range of distinct
disease indications, including ischemic injury and cardiovascular disease, certain neurological
diseases, autoimmune disease, transplant support (including in oncology patients), and a range of
orphan disease indications. As a result, we expect to be able to efficiently add clinical indications as we further expand the scope of potential applications for MultiStem, enabling us to
reduce costs and shorten development timelines in comparison to traditional single-use preclinical
studies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with independent investigators, we have conducted preclinical studies in relevant animal
models designed to evaluate safety and potential therapeutic benefit in various disease
indications. Based on the results of these and other studies, we have submitted and the FDA has
authorized three investigational new drug applications, or INDs, involving administration of
MultiStem in phase I clinical trials in treating distinct disease conditions to date. We advanced
two MultiStem programs into clinical development in 2008, initiating phase I clinical trials in
cardiovascular disease (treating patients that have suffered an acute myocardial infarction) and in
oncology treatment support (administering MultiStem to leukemia or lymphoma patients who are
receiving a traditional bone marrow or HSC transplant to reduce the risk or severity of graft
versus host disease, or GVHD). We are conducting the acute myocardial infarction clinical trial
with our partner Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Angiotech, and we completed phase I enrollment
in the first quarter of 2010.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>MultiStem for Heart Attack, HSC Transplant Support in Treatment of Hematologic Malignancies &#038;
Stroke</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with independent investigators at a number of leading institutions, such as the University
of Minnesota, the Cleveland Clinic, the National Institutes of Health, the Medical College of
Georgia, the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center and the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, we
have studied MultiStem in a range of in vitro and animal models that reflect various types of human
disease or injury, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, brain damage due to restricted blood flow
in newborns, vascular disease, and bone marrow transplant support/GVHD. In addition, we are
exploring, or intend to explore, the potential application of MultiStem in the treatment of a range
of other conditions such as certain blood or immune deficiencies and various autoimmune diseases.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As stated above, we have consistently observed that MultiStem is safe and effective in animal
models. As a result, we have advanced MultiStem to clinical development stage in three areas:
treatment of damage caused by myocardial infarction; support in the hematologic malignancy setting
to reduce certain complications associated with traditional bone marrow or HSC transplantation; and
treatment for stroke caused by a blockage of blood flow in the brain. We may expand to other
clinical indication areas as results warrant and resources permit.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In our current phase I clinical trial, we are exploring the use of MultiStem as a treatment for
damage caused by myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Myocardial infarction is one of the
leading causes of death and disability in the United States. Myocardial infarction is caused by the
blockage of one or more arteries that supply blood to the heart. Such blockages can be caused, for
example, by the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque deposit. According to the American Heart
Association 2010 Statistical Update, there were approximately 935,000 cases of myocardial
infarction that occurred in the United States in 2006 and approximately 8.5&nbsp;million individuals
living in the United States that had previously suffered a heart attack. In addition, there were
more than 831,000 deaths that occurred from various forms of cardiovascular disease, including
567,000 individuals that died as a result of a myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure. A
variety of risk factors are associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction or
atherosclerosis, including age, high blood pressure, smoking, sedentary lifestyle and genetics.
While advances in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of heart disease have had a positive
impact, there is clearly room for improvement &#151; myocardial infarction remains a leading cause of
death and disability in the United States and the rest of the world.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">MultiStem has been studied in validated animal models of AMI, including at both the Cleveland
Clinic and the University of Minnesota. Investigators demonstrated that the administration of
allogeneic MultiStem into the hearts of animals damaged by experimentally induced heart attacks
resulted in significant functional improvement in cardiac output and other functional parameters
compared with animals that received placebo or no treatment. Furthermore, the administration of
immunosuppressive drug was not required and provided no additional benefit in this study, and
supports the concept of using MultiStem as an allogeneic product.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with a qualified contract research organization, we completed additional preclinical
studies in established pig models of acute myocardial infarction using catheter delivery and
examining various factors such as the route and method of MultiStem administration, dose ranging,
and timing of treatment. In 2008, we initiated a multicenter phase I clinical trial in this indication, and during the first quarter of 2010, we completed
enrollment. We are working with leading cardiovascular treatment clinical sites and experts in the
area of cardiovascular disease to complete this phase I clinical trial.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing MultiStem for this indication in conjunction with our partner, Angiotech. We
entered into a product co-development collaboration with Angiotech in May&nbsp;2006, for the potential
application of MultiStem in multiple cardiovascular indications including myocardial infarction,
peripheral vascular disease and certain other indications.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Another area of focus is the use of MultiStem as adjunctive treatment for HSC/bone marrow
transplant used as therapy in hematologic malignancy. For many types of cancer, such as leukemia or
other blood-borne cancers, treatment typically involves radiation therapy or chemotherapy, alone or
in combination. Such treatment can substantially deplete the cells of the blood and immune system,
by reducing the number of stem cells in the bone marrow from which they arise. The more intense the
radiation treatment or chemotherapy, the more severe the resulting depletion is of the bone marrow,
blood, and immune system. Other tissues may also be affected, such as cells in the digestive tract
and in the pulmonary system. The result may be severe anemia, immunodeficiency, significant
reduction in digestive capacity, and other problems that may result in significant disability or
death.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">One strategy for treating the depletion of bone marrow is to perform a peripheral blood stem cell
transplant or a bone marrow transplant. This approach may augment the patient&#146;s ability to form new
blood and immune cells and provide a significant survival advantage. However, finding a closely
matched donor is frequently difficult or even impossible. Even when such a donor is found, in many
cases there are immunological complications, such as GVHD, which may result in serious disability
or death.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with leading experts in the stem cell and bone marrow transplantation field, we have
studied MultiStem in animal models of radiation therapy and GVHD. In multiple animal models,
MultiStem has been shown to be non-immunogenic, even when administered without the genetic matching
that is typically required for conventional bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Furthermore,
in animal model systems testing immune reactivity of T-cells against unrelated donor tissue,
MultiStem has been shown to suppress the T-cell-mediated immune responses that are an important
factor in causing GVHD. MultiStem-treated animals also displayed a significant increase in survival
relative to controls. As a result, we believe that the administration of MultiStem in conjunction
with or following standard HSC transplantation may have the potential to reduce the incidence or
severity of complications and may enhance gastrointestinal function which is frequently compromised
as a result of radiation treatment or chemotherapy.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2008, we initiated a phase I clinical trial to examine the safety and tolerability of MultiStem
in patients receiving a bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplant related to their
treatment for hematologic malignancy. The trial is an open label, multicenter trial that involves
leading experts in the field of bone marrow transplantation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A third focus of our regenerative medicine program is the use of MultiStem for the treatment of
neurological injury as a result of ischemic stroke, which accounts for approximately 85% of all
strokes. Recent progress toward the development of safer and more effective treatments for ischemic
stroke has been disappointing. Despite the fact that ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes
of death and disability in the United States, affecting more than 700,000 new patients annually
according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, there has been
little progress toward the development of treatments that improve the prognosis for stroke victims.
The only FDA-approved drug currently available for ischemic stroke is the anti-clotting factor,
tPA. According to current clinical guidelines, tPA must be administered to stroke patients within
three hours after the occurrence of the ischemic stroke to remove the clot while minimizing
potential risks, such as bleeding into the brain. Administration of tPA after this time frame is
not recommended, since it can cause bleeding or even death. Given this limited therapeutic window,
it is estimated that less than 5% of ischemic stroke victims currently receive treatment with tPA.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In preclinical studies conducted by investigators, including at both the University of Minnesota
and the Medical College of Georgia, significant functional improvements have been observed in rodents that have
undergone an experimentally induced stroke, or that have incurred significant neurological damage
as a result of neonatal hypoxic ischemia, and then received treatment with MultiStem. Through
research conducted by collaborators at the Medical College of Georgia and presented at the annual
American Academy of Neurology meeting in April&nbsp;2006, we observed that administration of MultiStem
even one week after a surgically induced stroke results in substantial long-term therapeutic
benefit, as evidenced by the improvement of treated animals compared with controls in a battery of
tests examining mobility, strength, fine motor skills, and other aspects of neurological functional
improvement. We believe that this benefit is achieved through several mechanisms, including
reduction of inflammation and immune system modulation in the ischemic area and the protection and
rescue of damaged or injured cells, including neuronal tissue. These results have been confirmed
in subsequent studies that demonstrate MultiStem treatment is well tolerated, does not require
immunosuppression, and results in a robust and durable therapeutic benefit even when administered
one week after the initial stroke event.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2008, we completed additional preclinical safety studies and submitted an IND for this
application, which has been authorized by the FDA. The phase I safety clinical trial authorized by
the FDA is a double blind, placebo controlled study that allows for administration of MultiStem to
patients 48 to 60 hours after the ischemic stroke, which, if shown to be safe and effective, would
represent a significant extension of the treatment window relative to existing standard of care.
We have initiated planning and are continuing preparations for the commencement of the phase I study.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to develop and
commercialize MutiStem for the treatment of IBD for the worldwide market. IBD is a group of
inflammatory and autoimmune conditions that affect the colon and small intestine, typically
resulting in severe abdominal pain, weight loss, vomiting and diarrhea. The most common forms of
the disease include ulcerative colitis and crohn&#146;s disease, which are estimated to affect more than
two million people in the U.S., major European countries and Japan. Chronic IBD can be a severely
debilitating condition, and advanced cases may require surgery to remove the affected region of the
bowel, and may also require temporary or permanent colostomy or iliostomy. In many cases, surgery
does not achieve a permanent cure, and patients suffer a return of the disease. We are currently
planning and preparing for a phase I clinical study in the IBD area, and plan to initiate the study
as soon as possible after regulatory approval.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that MultiStem could have broad potential to treat a range of conditions. In addition to
the above programs, working with partners and collaborators, and as resources permit, we intend to
explore the potential utility of MultiStem for treating a range of other conditions, including
autoimmune diseases, other conditions that involve the immune system, and certain neurological
conditions, especially those in which inflammation plays a role. We believe that MultiStem could
have utility in treating multiple diseases, and as a result, has the potential to create
significant value for our Company and our stockholders.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Obesity is a substantial contributing factor to a range of diseases that represent the major causes
of death and disability in the developed world today. Individuals that are clinically obese have
elevated rates of cardiovascular disease, stroke, certain types of cancer and diabetes. According
to the CDC, the incidence of obesity in the United States has increased at an epidemic rate during
the past 20&nbsp;years. CDC now estimates that 66% of all Americans are overweight, including more than
30% that are considered clinically obese. The percentage of young people who are overweight has
more than tripled since 1980. There has also been a dramatic rise in the rate of obesity in Europe
and Asia. Despite the magnitude of this problem, current approaches to clinical obesity are largely
ineffective, and we are aware of relatively few new therapeutic approaches in clinical development.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; margin-left: .25in; width: 7.20in">




<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing novel pharmaceutical treatments for obesity, which are compounds designed to act
by stimulating a key receptor in the brain that regulates appetite and food intake &#151; the 5HT2c
receptor. The role of this receptor in regulating food intake is well understood in both animal
models and humans. In 1996, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals launched the anti-obesity drug Redux<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
(dexfenfluramine), a non-specific serotonin receptor agonist that was used with the stimulant
phentermine in a combination commonly known as fen-phen. This diet drug combination gained rapid and widespread acceptance in the clinical marketplace and was shown to be
highly effective at regulating appetite, reducing food intake, and causing weight loss.
Unfortunately, in addition to stimulating the 5HT2c receptor, Redux also stimulated the 5HT2b
receptor that is found in the heart. The activation of 5HT2b by Redux is believed to have caused
significant cardiovascular problems in a number of patients and, as a result, Redux was withdrawn
from the market in 1997. In 1996, doctors wrote 18&nbsp;million monthly prescriptions for drugs
constituting the fen/phen combination. In that same year, these drugs generated sales of greater
than $400&nbsp;million, serving as a benchmark for the substantial market opportunity for an effective
drug to treat clinical obesity.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since the withdrawal of Redux from the market, several groups have published research that
implicates stimulation of the 5HT2b receptor as the underlying cause of the cardiovascular
problems. These findings suggest that highly selective compounds that stimulate the 5HT2c receptor,
but that do not appreciably stimulate the 5HT2b receptor, could be developed that maintain the
desired appetite suppressive effects without the cardiovascular toxicity. Recently, Arena
Pharmaceuticals developed a selective 5HT2c agonist, Lorcaserin, which exhibits significant
selectivity for the 5HT2c receptor relative to the 5HT2b receptor. In a phase II clinical trial
conducted by Arena Pharmaceuticals, Lorcaserin was demonstrated to reduce appetite and cause
statistically significant weight loss in patients that were administered the drug for a period of
three months, without causing any apparent cardiovascular effects. However, at higher doses the
drug has been shown to cause dizziness, nausea and headaches, which may be a consequence of its
apparently more limited selectivity for the 5HT2c receptor relative to another serotonin receptor
expressed in the brain, the 5HT2a receptor. Arena Pharmaceuticals recently completed two phase III
clinical trials designed to evaluate safety, including cardiovascular safety, and effectiveness at
causing weight loss in patients that are administered Lorcaserin for a period of up to two years.
The results of these studies demonstrated that there was no evidence of cardiovascular toxicity or
other serious adverse events, however, only modest weight loss was seen. We believe the modest
weight loss is a result of the inability to administer Lorcaserin at higher dose levels in order to
achieve a greater therapeutic effect &#151; a reflection of the limited compound selectivity at the
5HT2a receptor and the neurological side effects seen at higher dose levels.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We initiated a drug development program focused on creating potent and selective compounds that
stimulate the 5HT2c receptor, but that avoid the 5HT2b receptor and other receptors, such as 5HT2a.
Our specific goal has been to develop an orally administered pill that reduces appetite by
stimulating the 5HT2c receptor, but that does not stimulate the 5HT2b receptor, the 5HT2a receptor,
or other receptors that could cause adverse side effects. Based on extensive preclinical studies
that we have conducted with compounds that we have developed, we have demonstrated the ability to
develop highly potent and selective compounds that are potent and selective for the 5HT2c receptor,
and that lack activity at either 5HT2a or 5HT2b. We believe that the potency and selectivity
profile displayed by compounds we are developing for the 5HT2c receptor relative to both the 5HT2b
receptor and the 5HT2a receptor will result in substantially better efficacy and a cleaner safety
and tolerability profile in clinical trials, as well as a more convenient dosing schedule than
other 5HT2c agonist programs.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to our other programs, we are independently developing novel, orally-active
pharmaceuticals that are designed to enhance wakefulness and promote cognitive abilities in
patients that experience attention or cognitive deficits. Individuals that suffer from narcolepsy
or other conditions that result in excessive daytime sleepiness, or EDS, may experience persistent
tiredness and lack of energy. Chronic fatigue may be experienced by patients with other disease
conditions such as Parkinson&#146;s or those undergoing treatment for cancer. As a result, such
individuals may experience significant difficulty in performing certain tasks and may suffer an
impaired quality of life. More than 100,000 individuals in the United States suffer from narcolepsy
or EDS. Historically, narcoleptics were treated with amphetamines and related stimulants that had
substantial side-effects, but more recently have been prescribed Provigil (Modafinil). This
compound works by an unknown mechanism, but appears to be relatively free of the stimulant
side-effects of amphetamines. In addition to its use for narcolepsy, Provigil is also approved for
the treatment of shift work sleep disorder, or SWSD, and sleep apnea. Known side effects
experienced by patients taking Provigil include anxiety, depression, rash, and rare occurrences of
serious and potentially life threatening reactions including Stevens Johnson Syndrome, Toxic
Epidermal Necrolysis, Erythema Multiforme, and multi-organ hypersensitivity. Sales of Provigil in
2008 were reported to be over $950&nbsp;million. Although Provigil appears to be an improvement over
previous narcolepsy drugs, certain safety concerns were raised by the FDA when Cephalon, Inc.
attempted to gain approval of Modafinil for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, and
the company subsequently abandoned efforts in this market.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Individuals with attention or cognitive disorders may suffer from an inability to focus, solve
problems, process information, communicate, and may have memory impairment. Attention and cognitive
disorders include ADHD, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#146;s disease and other forms of dementia. Reuters
Business Insights estimates that in 2008 nearly 25&nbsp;million people suffered from ADHD in the seven
major pharmaceutical markets (United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and
Japan). Research also shows that 60% of children with ADHD maintain the disorder into adulthood,
and the condition afflicts predominantly boys. According to IMS Health, aggregate global sales of
drugs for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy were more than $5.7&nbsp;billion in 2008, and most of these
were psychostimulants (e.g. methylphenidate, amphetamine/dexamfetamine, modafinil) with side
effects and abuse potential. Despite the limitations of these products, the market grew by more
than 13% over the prior year. We believe there exists a significant market opportunity for safer
and more effective treatments.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing multiple classes of highly selective and potent compounds designed to block the
H3 receptor and have established a program to develop non-stimulant, non-addictive, orally
administered drugs for the treatment of narcolepsy or other conditions related to excessive daytime
sleepiness. Our histamine H3 receptor antagonists represent a new class of drugs that could have an
improved efficacy and safety profile relative to existing drugs used for the treatment of
narcolepsy and related sleep disorders. The H3 receptor regulates levels of histamine and other
neurotransmitters in certain areas of the brain that play a direct role in regulating sleep and
cognitive function. The histamine H3 receptor antagonists being developed at Athersys represent a
new class of drugs that could have an improved efficacy and safety profile relative to existing
drugs used for the treatment of a range of conditions that affect cognitive ability, attention or
wakefulness. In animal models, H3 receptor antagonists have been shown to increase histamine
release in the brain and improve wakefulness, attention and learning. In preclinical studies
conducted at independent labs, we have tested some of our more advanced compounds in well validated
rodent sleep models. During these studies, compounds significantly enhanced wakefulness without
causing hyperactivity. In comparison to Modafinil or caffeine, certain compounds appeared far more
potent, achieving a comparable or better effect on wakefulness at substantially lower doses. In
addition, these compounds did not appear to cause the excessive rebound sleepiness that is a
characteristic of other agents used to promote wakefulness, such as amphetamines.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We intend to continue the study of H3 antagonist compounds that we are developing for potential
applications in treating narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, chronic fatigue associated with
certain disease conditions such as Parkinson&#146;s, certain attention or cognitive disorders, and other
conditions. In addition, we intend to conduct additional pharmacology and safety testing of certain
compounds we are developing, and are exploring potential partnering opportunities around this and
other programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to our current product development programs, we developed our patented random
activation of gene expression, or RAGE, technology that provides us with the ability to produce
human cell lines that express specific, biologically well validated drug targets without relying
upon cloned and isolated gene sequences. While our RAGE technology is not a product, it is a
commercial technology that we have successfully applied for the benefit of our partners and that we
have also used for our own internal drug development programs. Modern drug screening approaches
typically require the physical isolation and structural modification of a gene of interest, an
approach referred to as gene cloning, in order to create a cell line that expresses a drug target
of interest. Researchers may then use the genetically modified cell line to identify pharmaceutical
compounds that inhibit or stimulate the target of interest. The RAGE technology enables us to turn
on or amplify the expression of a drug target without having to physically clone or isolate the
gene. In effect, the technology works through the random insertion of tiny, proprietary genetic
switches that randomly turn genes on without requiring their physical isolation, or any advance
knowledge of their structure. This technology provides us with broad freedom to work with targets
that may be otherwise unavailable as a result of intellectual property restrictions on the use of
specific cloned and isolated genes. Over the past several years, we have produced cell lines that
express drug targets in a range of disease areas such as metabolic disease, infectious disease,
oncology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and central nervous system disorders. Many of these
were produced for drug development programs at major pharmaceutical companies that we have
collaborated with, such as our ongoing collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, and some have been
produced for our internal drug development programs.

commercialize MutiStem for the treatment of IBD for the worldwide market. Under the terms of the
agreement, we received an up-front cash payment of $6&nbsp;million from Pfizer and will receive research
funding and support during the initial phase of the collaboration. In addition, we are also
eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $105&nbsp;million upon the successful achievement of
certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, though there can be no assurance that we
will achieve any milestones. We will be responsible for manufacturing and Pfizer will pay us for
manufacturing product for clinical development and commercialization purposes. Pfizer will have
responsibility for development, regulatory and commercialization and will pay us tiered royalties
on worldwide commercial sales of MultiStem IBD products. Alternatively, in lieu of royalties and
certain commercialization milestones, we may elect to co-develop with Pfizer and the parties will

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Pfizer collaboration does not have a specific termination date, but will
terminate upon the last to expire royalty term, unless terminated earlier by
either party. Either party can terminate the agreement for an uncured material
breach or default. Pfizer is permitted to terminate the agreement upon advance

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2006, we established a collaboration with Angiotech that is focused on co-developing
MultiStem for the treatment of damage caused by myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular
disease. In support of the collaboration, Angiotech invested $10.0&nbsp;million in us and we may also receive up to $3.75&nbsp;million
of additional equity investments and $63.75&nbsp;million of aggregate cash payments based upon the
successful achievement of specified clinical development and commercialization milestones, though
there can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the terms of the collaboration, the parties are jointly funding clinical development
activities, whereby preclinical costs are borne solely by Athersys, costs for phase I and phase II
clinical trials are borne 50% by Athersys and 50% by Angiotech, costs for the first phase III
clinical trial will be borne 33% by Athersys and 67% by Angiotech, and costs for any phase III
clinical trials subsequent to the first phase III clinical trial will be borne 25% by Athersys and
75% by Angiotech. We have lead responsibility for preclinical and early clinical development and
manufacturing of the MultiStem product, and Angiotech will take the lead on pivotal and later
clinical trials and commercialization. We will receive nearly half of the net profits from the
sale of any jointly developed, approved products. In addition, we will retain the commercial rights
to MultiStem for all other therapeutic applications, including treatment of stroke, bone marrow
transplantation and oncology support, blood and immune system disorders, autoimmune disease, and
other indications that we may elect to pursue.

right to immediately terminate the collaboration upon certain bankruptcy events involving us.
Angiotech also has the right to terminate the collaboration upon 120&nbsp;days&#146; prior notice if
Angiotech, in its reasonable judgment, determines that: (1)&nbsp;a primary endpoint in a clinical trial

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Bristol-Myers Squibb</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2000, we entered into a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to provide cell lines
expressing well validated drug targets produced using our RAGE technology for compound screening
and development. This initial collaboration was expanded in 2002 and again in 2006, and is now in
its final phase as amended in 2009. Bristol-Myers Squibb uses the cell lines in its internal drug
development programs and, in exchange, we receive license fee and milestone payments and will be
entitled to receive royalties on the sale of any approved products. Depending on the use of a cell
line by Bristol-Myers Squibb and the progress of drug development programs benefiting from the use
of such a cell line, we may receive as much as approximately $5.5&nbsp;million per cell line in
additional license fees and milestone payments, though we cannot assure you that any further
milestones will be achieved or that we will receive any additional milestone payments. In
September&nbsp;2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb successfully advanced into phase II clinical development a
drug candidate discovered using a target provided by us, thereby triggering a clinical development
milestone payment to us.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We intend to continue to prepare and deliver validated drug targets for use by Bristol-Myers Squibb
in its drug discovery efforts until the collaboration objectives have been fulfilled. We will remain entitled
to receive license fees for targets delivered to Bristol-Myers Squibb, as well as milestone
payments and royalties on compounds developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb using our technology. Beyond
2009, we anticipate that Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s demand for new targets will be substantially
reduced or cease altogether.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration does not have a specific termination date, but will
terminate when Bristol-Myers Squibb no longer has an obligation to pay us royalties, which
obligation generally continues until the later of the expiration of the Bristol-Myers Squibb patent
covering an approved product and ten years after commercial sales of that product began. Though we
expect Bristol-Myers Squibb to file for and be issued patents for products developed under the
collaboration, we are not aware of any patents issued to Bristol-Myers Squibb covering any
potential products related to the collaboration. If either party breaches its material obligations
and fails to cure that breach within 60&nbsp;days after notice from the non-breaching party, the
non-breaching party may terminate the collaboration.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We face significant competition with respect to the various dimensions of our business. With regard
to our efforts to develop MultiStem as a novel stem cell therapy, currently, there are a number of
companies that are actively developing stem cell products, which encompass a range of different
cell types, including embryonic stem cells, umbilical cord stem cells, adult-derived stem cells,
and processed bone marrow derived cells.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Osiris is currently engaged in multiple phase II and phase III clinical trials involving Prochymal,
an allogeneic stem cell product based on mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs, that are obtained from
healthy consenting donors, and are administered without tissue matching. However, in contrast to
MultiStem, MSCs display limited expansion potential and more limited biological plasticity. In
November&nbsp;2008, Osiris announced a partnership in which Genzyme acquired development rights to
Prochymal for certain markets outside the United States and Canada in exchange for $130&nbsp;million in
license fees, up to $1.25&nbsp;billion in clinical and sales milestones, and royalties. Osiris retains
commercial development rights to Prochymal for the United States and Canada.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Other public companies are developing stem-related therapies, including Geron, Aastrom Biosciences,
Stem Cells Inc., Viacell, Celgene, Advanced Cell Technology, CRYO-CELL International, Mesoblast
Limited, Pluristem and Cytori Therapeutics. In addition, private companies, such as Cognate
Therapeutics, Gamida Cell, Plureon, Cellerix and others, are also developing cell therapy related
products or capabilities. Given the magnitude of the potential opportunity for stem cell therapy,
we expect competition in this area to intensify in the coming years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We also face competition in our efforts to develop compounds for the treatment of obesity. There
are already approved therapeutic products on the market, such as Xenical (also known as Alli),
which is marketed by Roche, and Meridia, which is marketed by Abbott Pharmaceuticals. However, both
of these drugs have reported side effects that we believe have limited their adoption by patients
and clinicians. For example, potential side effects associated with taking Xenical / Alli include
cramping, intestinal discomfort, flatulence, diarrhea, and leakage of oily stool. Potential side
effects associated with taking Meridia include increased blood pressure and heart rate, headache,
dry mouth, constipation, and insomnia. Individuals with high blood pressure, heart disease,
irregular heartbeat, or a history of stroke are also cautioned not to take Meridia.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">There are many other companies attempting to develop novel treatments for obesity, and a wide range
of approaches are being taken. Some of these companies include large, multinational pharmaceutical
companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Roche, Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly
and others. There are also a variety of biotechnology companies developing treatments for obesity,
including Arena Pharmaceuticals, Orexigen, Vivus, Neurosearch, Amgen, Regeneron, Nastech
Pharmaceutical Company, Alizyme, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Neurocrine Biosciences, Shionogi,
Metabolic Pharmaceuticals, Kyorin Pharmaceutical, and others. It is likely that, given the
magnitude of the market opportunity, many companies will continue to focus on the obesity area, and
that competition will remain high. If we are successful at developing a 5HT2c agonist as a safe and
effective treatment for obesity, it is likely that other companies will attempt to develop safer
and more effective compounds in the same class, or will attempt to combine therapies in an effort
to establish a safer and more effective therapeutic product.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Finally, we face competition with respect to our ability to produce drug targets for our drug
development programs.
There are many companies with established intellectual property that seek to restrict or protect
the use of specific drug targets, including Incyte, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Human Genome
Sciences, Lexicon Genetics, CuraGen, Exelixis, Myriad Genetics, Sangamo BioSciences, and others.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe our most significant competitors are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more
established biotechnology companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, sales,
marketing, and human resources than we do. These companies may succeed in obtaining regulatory
approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, our
competitors may develop technologies and products that are cheaper, safer or more effective than
those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. Furthermore, some of
these companies may feel threatened by our activities and attempt to delay or impede our efforts to
develop our products or apply our technologies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Intellectual Property</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We rely on a combination of patent applications, patents, trademarks, and contractual provisions to
protect our proprietary rights. We believe that to have a competitive advantage, we must develop
and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. Currently, we require our officers,
employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored
researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their
employment, consulting, or advisory relationships with us, where appropriate. We also require our
employees, consultants, and advisors who we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and
assign to us all inventions conceived during the work day, developed using our property, or which
relate to our business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have a broad patent estate with claims directed to compositions, methods of production, and
methods of use of certain non-embryonic stem cells and related technologies. We acquired ownership
of part of our stem cell technology and intellectual property as a result of our 2003 acquisition
of a holding company, which held the rights to the technology originally discovered at the
University of Minnesota. We also have an exclusive license to additional MAPC-related inventions
(or in other words, improvements) developed by the University of Minnesota through May&nbsp;2009, and
under a collaborative research agreement with the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or KUL, we have
an exclusive license to MAPC-related inventions developed at KUL using the MAPC technology or
intellectual property or that result from sponsored research funded by us. We also own and license
additional intellectual property develop by us and others. We have fourteen issued patents and more
than 120 patent applications related to our stem cell technologies. Our current intellectual
property estate, which may broaden over time, could provide coverage for our cell compositions,
methods of use, manufacturing processes, and product candidates through as late as 2028.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have established a broad intellectual property portfolio related to our key functional genomics
technologies and product candidates. We have a broad patent estate with claims directed to
compositions, methods of making, and methods of using our small molecule drug candidates. We have
filed four patent applications with broad claims directed to ATHX-105, related compounds in the
same chemical series from which ATHX-105 was derived, and back-up and second generation compounds
from distinct chemical series. In our Histamine H3 program, we have filed four patent applications
with broad claims directed to compounds from two distinct chemical series. All compounds described
in these patent applications were discovered at Athersys. In addition, we currently have fourteen
issued United States patents and various issued international patents relating to compositions and
methods for the RAGE technology. These patents will expire in 2017. There are also several patent
applications relating to human proteins and candidate drug targets that we have identified through
the application of RAGE and our other technologies. The RAGE technology was developed by Dr.&nbsp;John
Harrington and other Athersys scientists internally in the mid-1990s.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that we have broad freedom to use and commercially develop our technologies and product
candidates. However, if successful, a patent infringement suit brought against us may force us or
any of our collaborators or licensees to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, or selling
potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party&#146;s intellectual property, unless that
party grants us rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we may be required to
obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others to continue to commercialize our
products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or
proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain
rights to the third party&#146;s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual
property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have
to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could
severely harm our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Government Regulation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Any products we may develop and our research and development activities are subject to stringent
government regulation in the United States by the FDA and, in many instances, by corresponding
foreign and state regulatory agencies. The European Union, or EU, has vested centralized authority
in the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products to
standardize review and approval across EU member nations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">These regulatory agencies enforce comprehensive statutes, regulations, and guidelines governing the
drug development process. This process involves several steps. Initially, the company must generate
preclinical data to show safety before human testing may be initiated. In the United States, the
drug company must submit an IND to the FDA prior to securing authorization for human testing. The
IND must contain adequate data on product candidate chemistry, toxicology and metabolism and, where
appropriate, animal research testing to support initial safety.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A CTA is the European equivalent of the U.S. IND. CTA requirements are issued by each competent
authority within the European Union and are enacted by local laws and Directives.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Any of our product candidates will require regulatory approval and compliance with regulations made
by United States and foreign government agencies prior to commercialization in such countries. The
process of obtaining FDA or foreign regulatory agency approval has historically been extremely
costly and time consuming. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing,
manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion,
sale, and distribution of biologics and new drugs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Preclinical studies can take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based
on those studies will become effective to permit clinical trials to begin. Once clinical trials are
initiated, they generally take five to seven years, or longer, to complete. After completion of
clinical trials of a new drug or biologic product, FDA approval of the NDA or BLA must be obtained. This process requires substantial time and effort and
there is no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that
the FDA will grant approval. In the past, the FDA&#146;s approval of an NDA or BLA has taken, on
average, one to two years, but in some instances may take substantially longer. If questions
regarding safety or efficacy arise, additional studies may be required, followed by a resubmission
of the NDA or BLA. Review and approval of an NDA or BLA can take up to several years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each drug manufacturing facility must be
inspected and approved by the FDA. All manufacturing establishments are subject to inspections by
the FDA and by other federal, state, and local agencies, and must comply with GMP requirements. We
do not currently have any GMP manufacturing capabilities, and will rely on contract manufacturers
to produce material for any clinical trials that we may conduct.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We must also obtain regulatory approval in other countries in which we intend to market any drug.
The requirements governing conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and
reimbursement vary widely from country to country. FDA approval does not ensure regulatory approval
in other countries. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent
in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In some countries, the sale price
of the drug must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is
granted. Even if a foreign regulatory authority approves a drug product, it may not approve
satisfactory prices for the product.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to regulation under the
Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control

state, or local regulations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous
materials, chemicals, biological materials, and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe
that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials currently comply in all
material respects with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of
accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the
event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such

in other SEC filings, describe risks that could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our equity securities could
decline. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business, financial condition and

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Athersys has incurred losses since inception and we expect to incur significant net losses in the
foreseeable future and may never become profitable.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since Athersys&#146; inception in 1995, it has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from
operations. Athersys has incurred net losses of $19&nbsp;million in 2007, $18&nbsp;million in 2008 and
$15&nbsp;million in 2009. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had an accumulated deficit of $194&nbsp;million, and
anticipate incurring additional losses for at least the next several years. We expect to spend
significant resources over the next several years to enhance our technologies and to fund research
and development of our pipeline of potential products. To date, substantially all of Athersys&#146;
revenue has been derived from corporate collaborations, license agreements and government grants.
In order to achieve profitability, we must develop products and technologies that can be
commercialized by us or through future collaborations. Our ability to generate revenues and become
profitable will depend on our ability, alone or with potential collaborators, to timely,
efficiently and successfully complete the development of our product candidates. We have never
earned revenue from selling a product and we may never do so, as none of our product candidates
have been approved for sale, since they are currently being tested yet in humans and animal
studies. We cannot assure you that we will ever earn revenue or that we will ever become
profitable. If we sustain losses over an extended period of time, we may be unable to continue our
business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We will need substantial additional funding to develop our products and for our future operations.
If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to do so, we may be required to delay, scale back or
eliminate our product development activities or may be unable to continue our business.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The development of our product candidates will require a commitment of substantial funds to conduct
the costly and time-consuming research, which may include preclinical and clinical testing,
necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and bring our products to market. Net cash used in
Athersys&#146; operations was $12&nbsp;million in 2007, $16&nbsp;million in 2008 and $5&nbsp;million in 2009. We
expect to have available cash to fund our operations through 2011 based on our current business and
operational plans and assuming no new financings. Our future capital requirements will depend on
many factors, including:

will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our future operations. We cannot be
certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all, particularly in
light of the current credit crisis. In recent years, it has been difficult for companies to raise
capital due to a variety of factors, which may or may not continue. To the extent we raise
additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the ownership position of our existing
stockholders could be substantially diluted. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of
preferred stock or debt securities, these securities are likely to have rights, preferences and
privileges senior to our common stock. Fluctuating interest rates could also increase the costs of
any debt financing we may obtain.

is quite high, and many companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered
significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials.
Product candidates may fail to show desired safety and efficacy in larger and more diverse patient
populations in later stage clinical trials, despite having progressed through early stage trials.
Negative or inconclusive results from any of our ongoing preclinical studies or clinical trials
could result in delays, modifications, or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials and the
termination of our development of a product candidate. Additionally, even if we are able to
successfully complete pivotal phase III clinical trials, the FDA still may not approve our product
candidates.

several years, if at all. You must evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities
affecting an early stage biotechnology company. Our product candidates require additional research
and development, preclinical testing, clinical testing and regulatory review and/or approvals or

collaborations with other companies. Our strategy includes establishing collaborations and
licensing agreements with one or more pharmaceutical, biotechnology or device companies, preferably
after we have advanced product candidates through the initial stages of clinical development.
However, we may not be able to establish or maintain such licensing and collaboration arrangements
necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Even if we are able to maintain or
establish licensing or collaboration arrangements, these arrangements may not be on favorable terms
and may contain provisions that will restrict our ability to develop, test and market our product

technology, and our license with the University of Minnesota pursuant to which we license certain
aspects of the MultiStem technology. These arrangements do not have specific termination dates;
rather, each arrangement terminates upon the occurrence of certain events.

contracted duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to advance our product candidates
in a timely manner or at all.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our success depends on the performance by our collaborators of their responsibilities under our
collaboration arrangements. Some potential collaborators may not perform their obligations in a
timely fashion or in a manner satisfactory to us. Typically, we cannot control the amount of
resources or time our collaborators may devote to our programs or potential products that may be
developed in collaboration with us. We are currently involved in multiple research and development
collaborations with academic and research institutions. These collaborators frequently depend on
outside sources of funding to conduct or complete research and development, such as grants or other
awards. In addition, our academic collaborators may depend on graduate students, medical students,
or research assistants to conduct certain work, and such individuals may not be fully trained or
experienced in certain areas, or they may elect to discontinue their participation in a particular
research program, creating an inability to complete ongoing research in a timely and efficient
manner. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to control the precise timing and
execution of any experiments that may be conducted.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Additionally, our current or future corporate collaborators will retain the ability to pursue other
research, product development or commercial opportunities that may be directly competitive with our
programs. If these collaborators elect to prioritize or pursue other programs in lieu of ours, we
may not be able to advance product development programs in an efficient or effective manner, if at
all. If a collaborator is pursuing a competitive program and encounters unexpected financial or
capability limitations, they may be motivated to reduce the priority placed on our programs or
delay certain activities related to our programs or be unwilling to properly fund their share of
the development expenses for our programs. Any of these developments could harm our product and
technology development efforts, which could seriously harm our business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the terms of our collaboration agreement with Angiotech, either party may choose, following
the completion of phase I trials, to opt-out of its obligation to fund further product development
on a product-by-product basis, provided no clinical trials concerning such product candidate are
currently ongoing. If Angiotech should decide to opt-out of funding the development of any of the
product candidates for the covered indications, for any reason, we may be unable to fund the
development on our own and could be forced to halt one or more MultiStem development programs.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to the regulatory requirements for our pharmaceutical programs, we will also require
regulatory approvals for each distinct application of our stem cell product. In each case, we will
be required to conduct clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of MultiStem, or various
products that incorporate or use MultiStem. For product candidates that advance to clinical
testing, we cannot be certain that we or a collaborator will successfully complete the clinical
trials necessary to receive regulatory product approvals. This process is lengthy and expensive.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We intend to seek approval for our product candidates through the FDA approval process. To obtain
regulatory approvals, we must, among other requirements, complete clinical trials showing that our
products are safe and effective for a particular indication. Under the approval process, we must
submit clinical and non-clinical data to demonstrate the medication is safe and effective. For
example, we must be able to provide data and information, which may include extended pharmacology,
toxicology, reproductive toxicology, bioavailability and genotoxicity studies to establish
suitability for phase II or large scale phase III clinical trials.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of our product candidates are at an early stage of development. As these programs enter and
progress through early stage clinical development, or complete additional non-clinical testing, an
indication of a lack of safety or lack of efficacy may result in the early termination of an
ongoing trial, or may cause us or any of our collaborators to forego further development of a
particular product candidate or program. The FDA or other regulatory agencies may require extensive
clinical trials or other testing prior to granting approval, which could be costly and time
consuming to conduct. Any of these developments would hinder, and potentially prohibit, our ability
to commercialize our product candidates. We cannot assure you that clinical trials will in fact
demonstrate that our products are safe or effective.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Additionally, we may not be able to find acceptable patients or may experience delays in enrolling
patients for our currently planned or any future clinical trials. The FDA or we may suspend our
clinical trials at any time if either believes that we are exposing the subjects participating in
the trials to unacceptable health risks. The FDA or
institutional review boards and/or institutional biosafety committees at the medical institutions
and healthcare facilities where we seek to sponsor clinical trials may not permit a trial to
proceed or may suspend any trial indefinitely if they find deficiencies in the conduct of the

healthcare facilities to conduct our clinical trials, and, as a result, we may face additional
delaying factors outside our control. Significant delays may adversely affect our financial results

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Many factors, known and unknown, can adversely affect clinical trials and the ability to evaluate a
product&#146;s efficacy. During the course of treatment, patients can die or suffer other adverse events
for reasons that may or may not be related to the proposed product being tested. Even if unrelated
to our product, certain events can nevertheless adversely impact our clinical trials. As a result,
our ability to ultimately develop and market the products and obtain revenues would suffer.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Even promising results in preclinical studies and initial clinical trials do not ensure successful
results in later clinical trials, which test broader human use of our products. Many companies in
our industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, despite promising
results in earlier trials. Even successful clinical trials may not result in a marketable product
or be indicative of the efficacy or safety of a product. Many factors or variables could affect the
results of clinical trials and cause them to appear more promising than they may otherwise be.
Product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials could ultimately be found to be
unsafe or ineffective.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, our ability to complete clinical trials depends on many factors, including obtaining

candidates, regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries where a product will be
sold may require extensive additional clinical trials or post-approval clinical studies that are
expensive and time consuming to conduct. In particular, therapeutic products administered for the
treatment of persistent or chronic conditions, such as obesity, are likely to require extensive
follow-up studies and close monitoring of patients after regulatory approval has been granted, for
any signs of adverse effects that occur over a long period of time. These studies may be expensive
and time consuming to conduct and may reveal side effects or other harmful effects in patients that
use our therapeutic products after they are on the market, which may result in the limitation or
withdrawal of our drugs from the market. Alternatively, we may not be able to conduct such
additional trials, which might force us to abandon our efforts to develop or commercialize certain
product candidates. Even if post-approval studies are not requested or required, after our products are approved and on the market, there might be safety issues that emerge over
time that require a change in product labeling or that require withdrawal of the product from the

established by the FDA, or similar regulations in other countries. Our pharmaceutical product
candidates or MultiStem product candidate may be in competition with other products or companies
for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if third parties give
other products greater priority than our product candidates. These third parties may not deliver
sufficient quantities of our pharmaceutical or MultiStem product candidates, manufacture our
pharmaceutical and MultiStem product candidates in accordance with specifications, or comply with

a significant problem that could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of product

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, patent law outside the United States is uncertain and in many countries intellectual
property laws are undergoing review and revision. The laws of some countries do not protect
intellectual property rights to the same extent as domestic laws. It may be necessary or useful for
us to participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our competitors&#146; patents
or to defend the validity of any of our or our licensor&#146;s future patents, which could result in
substantial costs and would divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.
With respect to certain of our inventions, we have decided not to pursue patent protection outside
the United States, both because we do not believe it is cost effective and because of
confidentiality concerns. Accordingly, our international competitors could develop and receive
foreign patent protection for gene sequences and functions for which we are seeking United
States patent protection, enabling them to sell products that we have developed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Technologies licensed to us by others, or in-licensed technologies, are important to our business.
The scope of our rights under our licenses may be subject to dispute by our licensors or third
parties. Our rights to use these technologies and to practice the inventions claimed in the
licensed patents are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not
terminating them. In particular, we depend on certain technologies relating to our MultiStem
technology licensed from the University of Minnesota, and the termination of this license could
result in our loss of some of the rights that enable us to utilize this technology, and our ability
to develop products based on MultiStem could be seriously hampered.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, we may in the future acquire rights to additional technologies by licensing such
rights from existing licensors or from third parties. Such in-licenses may be costly. Also, we
generally do not control the patent prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of in-licensed
technologies. Accordingly, we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this
intellectual property as we do over our internally developed technologies. Moreover, some of our
academic institution licensors, collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data
and information to which we have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our
technologies and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations, our ability
to protect our proprietary information or obtain patent protection in the future may be impaired,
which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We may not have adequate protection for our unpatented proprietary information, which could
adversely affect our competitive position.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to patents, we will substantially rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing
technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, others may
independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise
gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. To protect our trade secrets, we may
enter into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and potential collaborators.
However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets or adequate
remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. Likewise, our trade
secrets or know-how may become known through other means or be independently discovered by our
competitors. Any of these events could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product
candidates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Disputes concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the
proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and extremely costly and could delay our

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our commercial success, if any, will be significantly harmed if we infringe the patent rights of
third parties or if we breach any license or other agreements that we have entered into with regard
to our technology or business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are aware of other companies and academic institutions that have been performing research in the
areas of adult derived stem cells. In particular, other companies and academic institutions have
announced that they have identified nonembryonic stem cells isolated from bone marrow or other
tissues that have the ability to form a range of cell types, or display the property of
pluripotency. To the extent any of these companies or academic institutions currently have, or
obtain in the future, broad patent claims, such patents could block our ability to use various
aspects of our discovery and development process and might prevent us from developing or
commercializing newly discovered applications of our MultiStem technology, or otherwise conducting
our business. In addition, it is possible that some of the pharmaceutical product candidates we are
developing may not be patentable or may be covered by intellectual property of third parties.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are not currently a party to any litigation, interference, opposition, protest, reexamination or
any other potentially adverse governmental, ex parte or inter-party proceeding with regard to our
patent or trademark positions. However, the life sciences and other technology industries are
characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
Many life sciences and other technology companies have employed intellectual property litigation as
a way to gain a competitive advantage. If we become involved in litigation, interference
proceedings, oppositions, reexamination, protest or other potentially adverse intellectual property
proceedings as a result of alleged infringement by us of the rights of others or as a result of
priority of invention disputes with third parties, we might have to spend significant amounts of
money, time and effort defending our position and we may not be successful. In addition, any claims
relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights or proprietary determinations, even
if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert
management&#146;s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements
that are not advantageous to us. If we do not have the financial resources to support such
litigation or appeals, we may forfeit or lose certain commercial rights. Even if we have the
financial resources to continue such litigation or appeals, we may lose. In the event that we lose,
we may be forced to pay very substantial damages; we may have to obtain costly license rights,
which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all; or we may be prohibited from
selling products that are found to infringe the patent rights of others.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Should any person have filed patent applications or obtained patents that claim inventions also
claimed by us, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the relevant
patent regulatory agency to determine priority of invention and, thus, the right to a patent for
these inventions in the United States. Such a proceeding could result in substantial cost to us
even if the outcome is favorable. Even if successful on priority grounds, an interference action
may result in loss of claims based on patentability grounds raised in the interference action.
Litigation, interference proceedings or other proceedings could divert management&#146;s time and
efforts. Even unsuccessful claims could result in significant legal fees and other expenses,
diversion of management&#146;s time and disruption in our business. Uncertainties resulting from
initiation and continuation of any patent proceeding or related litigation could harm our ability
to compete and could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">An adverse ruling arising out of any intellectual property dispute, including an adverse decision
as to the priority of our inventions, could undercut or invalidate our intellectual property
position. An adverse ruling could also subject us to significant liability for damages, including
possible treble damages, prevent us from using technologies or developing products, or require us to negotiate licenses to disputed rights from third parties.
Although patent and intellectual property disputes in the technology area are often settled through
licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and
could include license fees and ongoing royalties. Furthermore, necessary licenses may not be
available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all. Failure to obtain a license in such a case could
have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We face significant competition with respect to our product candidates. With regard to our efforts
to develop MultiStem as a novel stem cell therapy, currently, there are a number of companies that
are actively developing stem cell products, which encompass a range of different cell types,
including embryonic stem cells, adult-derived stem cells, and processed bone marrow derived cells.
Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to
technological advances. Technological developments by others may result in our MultiStem product
platform and technologies, as well as our pharmaceutical formulations, becoming obsolete.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are subject to significant competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic
companies, academic and research institutions, and government or other publicly funded agencies
that are pursuing the development of therapeutic products and technologies that are substantially
similar to our proposed therapeutic products and technologies, or that otherwise address the
indications we are pursuing. Our most significant competitors include major pharmaceutical
companies such as Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Roche, Johnson &#038; Johnson, Sanofi-Aventis and
GlaxoSmithKline as well as smaller biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies such as Arena
Pharmaceuticals, Orexigen, Celgene, Vivus, Osiris, Geron, Aastrom, Stem Cells Inc., and Cytori
Therapeutics. Most of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater research and
development capabilities and financial, scientific, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, sales,
human resources, and experience than we do. Many of our competitors have several therapeutic
products that have already been developed, approved and successfully commercialized, or are in the
process of obtaining regulatory approval for their therapeutic products in the United States and
internationally.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources, research and development
resources and experience, manufacturing capabilities, regulatory expertise, sales and marketing
resources, established relationships with consumer products companies and production facilities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Universities and public and private research institutions are also potential competitors. While
these organizations primarily have educational objectives, they may develop proprietary
technologies related to stem cells or secure patent protection that we may need for the development
of our technologies and products. We may attempt to license these proprietary technologies, but
these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing
technologies or products that are more effective, safer, more affordable or more easily
commercialized than ours, and our competitors may obtain intellectual property protection or
commercialize products sooner than we do. Developments by others may render our product candidates
or our technologies obsolete.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our current product discovery and development collaborators are not prohibited from entering into
research and development collaboration agreements with third parties in any product field. Our
failure to compete effectively would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

collaborators comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, the risk of accidental
contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of
an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed
the limits or fall outside the coverage of any insurance we may obtain and exceed our financial resources. We may not be able

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Any changes related to these and other factors could adversely affect our business to the extent we
enter markets outside the United States.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Foreign governments often impose strict price controls on approved products, which may adversely
affect our future profitability in those countries, and the re-importation of drugs to the United
States from foreign countries that impose price controls may adversely affect our future
profitability.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Frequently foreign governments impose strict price controls on newly approved therapeutic products.
If we obtain regulatory approval to sell products in foreign countries, we may be unable to obtain
a price that provides an adequate financial return on our investment. Furthermore, legislation in
the United States may permit re-importation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States,
including re-importation from foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in
the United States due to foreign government-mandated price controls. Such a practice, especially if
it is conducted on a widespread basis, may significantly reduce our potential United
States revenues from any drugs that we are able to develop.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>If we elect not to sell our products in foreign countries that impose government mandated price
controls because we decide it is uneconomical to do so, a foreign government or patent office may
attempt to terminate our intellectual property rights in that country, enabling competitors to make
and sell our products.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In some cases we may choose not to sell a product in a foreign country because it is uneconomical
to do so under a system of government-imposed price controls, or because it could severely limit
our profitability in the United States or other markets. In such cases, a foreign government or
patent office may terminate any intellectual property rights we may obtain with respect to that
product. Such a termination could enable competitors to produce and sell our product in that
market. Furthermore, such products may be exported into the United States through legislation that
authorizes the importation of drugs from outside the United States. In such an event, we may have
to reduce our prices, or we may be unable to compete with low-cost providers of our drugs, and we
could be financially harmed as a result.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We may encounter difficulties managing our growth, which could adversely affect our business.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At various times we have experienced periods of rapid growth in our employee numbers as a result of
a dramatic increase in activity in technology programs, genomics programs, collaborative research
programs, discovery programs, and scope of operations. At other times, we have had to reduce staff
in order to bring our expenses in line with our financial resources. Our success will also depend
on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to improve our operational
capabilities and our management information and financial control systems, and to expand, train and
manage our work force.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We may be sued for product liability, which could adversely affect our business.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because our business strategy involves the development and sale by either us or our collaborators
of commercial products, we may be sued for product liability. We may be held liable if any product
we develop and commercialize, or any product our collaborators commercialize that incorporates any
of our technology, causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing,
manufacturing, marketing, sale or consumer use. In addition, the safety studies we must perform and
the regulatory approvals required to commercialize our pharmaceutical products, will not protect us from any such liability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We carry product liability insurance, as well as liability insurance for conducting clinical
trials. Currently, we carry a $5&nbsp;million per event, $5&nbsp;million annual aggregate coverage for both
our products liability policy and our clinical trials protection. We also intend to seek product
liability insurance for any approved products that we may develop or acquire. However, in the event
there are product liability claims against us, our insurance may be insufficient to cover the
expense of defending against such claims, or may be insufficient to pay or settle such claims.
Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain adequate product liability insurance coverage for
commercial sales of any of our approved products. If such insurance is insufficient to protect us,
our results of operations will suffer. If any product liability claim is made against us, our
reputation and future sales will be damaged, even if we have adequate insurance coverage.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>The availability, manner, and amount of reimbursement for our product candidates from government
and private payers are uncertain, and our inability to obtain adequate reimbursement for any
products could severely limit our product sales.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We expect that many of the patients who seek treatment with any of our products that are approved
for marketing will be eligible for Medicare benefits. Other patients may be covered by private
health plans. If we are unable to obtain or retain adequate levels of reimbursement from Medicare
or from private health plans, our ability to sell our products will be severely limited. The
application of existing Medicare regulations and interpretive coverage and payment determinations
to newly approved products is uncertain and those regulations and interpretive determinations are
subject to change. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act, enacted in
December&nbsp;2003, provides for a change in reimbursement methodology that reduces the Medicare
reimbursement rates for many drugs, which may adversely affect reimbursement for any products we
may develop. Medicare regulations and interpretive determinations also may determine who may be
reimbursed for certain services, and may limit the pool of patients our product candidates are
being developed to serve.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Federal, state and foreign governments continue to propose legislation designed to contain or
reduce health care costs. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of products like our
potential products may change further or be adopted before any of our potential products are
approved for marketing. Cost control initiatives by governments or third-party payers could
decrease the price that we receive for any one or all of our potential products or increase patient
coinsurance to a level that make our products under development become unaffordable. In addition,
government and private health plans persistently challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of
therapeutic products. Accordingly, these third parties may ultimately not consider any or all of
our products under development to be cost effective, which could result in products not being
covered under their health plans or covered only at a lower price. Any of these initiatives or
developments could prevent us from successfully marketing and selling any of our products that are
approved for commercialization.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Public perception of ethical and social issues surrounding the use of adult-derived stem cell
technology may limit or discourage the use of our technologies, which may reduce the demand for our
therapeutic products and technologies and reduce our revenues.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our success will depend in part upon our ability to develop therapeutic products incorporating or
discovered through our adult-derived stem cell technology. For social, ethical, or other reasons,
governmental authorities in the United States and other countries may call for limits on, or
regulation of the use of, adult-derived stem cell technologies. Although we do not use the more
controversial stem cells derived from embryos or fetuses, claims that adult-derived stem cell
technologies are ineffective, unethical or pose a danger to the environment may influence public
attitudes. The subject of stem cell technologies in general has received negative publicity and
aroused public debate in the United States and some other countries. Ethical and other concerns
about our adult-derived stem cell technology could materially hurt the market acceptance of our
therapeutic products and technologies, resulting in diminished sales and use of any products we are
able to develop using adult-derived stem cells.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As of February&nbsp;28, 2010, the number of holders of record was approximately 910 of which one is
Cede &#038; Co., a nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or DTC. Shares of common stock that are
held by financial institutions as nominees for beneficial owners are deposited into participant
accounts at DTC, and are considered to be held of record by Cede &#038; Co., as one stockholder.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Dividend Policy</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of our assets consist of the capital stock of ABT Holding Company. We would have to rely upon
dividends and other payments from ABT Holding Company to generate the funds necessary to make
dividend payments, if any, on our common stock. ABT Holding Company, however, is legally distinct
from us and has no obligation to pay amounts to us. The ability of ABT Holding Company to make
dividend and other payments to us is subject to, among other things, the availability of funds, the
terms of our indebtedness and applicable state laws. We did not pay cash dividends on our common
stock during the past two years. We do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends on our common
stock in the foreseeable future. Rather, we anticipate that we will retain earnings, if any, for
use in the development of our business.

Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; included below in this annual report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Overview and Recent Developments</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic
product candidates designed to extend and enhance the quality of human life. Through the
application of our proprietary technologies, we have established a pipeline of therapeutic product
development programs in multiple disease areas. Our current product development portfolio consists
of MultiStem, a patented and proprietary stem cell product that we are developing as a treatment
for multiple disease indications, and that is currently being evaluated in two ongoing clinical
trials. In addition, we are developing novel pharmaceuticals to treat indications such as obesity,
certain cognitive and attention disorders, as well as narcolepsy, other forms of excessive daytime
sleepiness and chronic fatigue associated with certain disease indications.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Current Programs</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2008, we advanced two MultiStem programs into clinical development, initiating phase I studies
in cardiovascular disease (treating patients that have suffered an acute myocardial infarction) and
in oncology treatment support (administering MultiStem to leukemia or lymphoma patients who are
receiving a traditional bone marrow or HSC transplant to reduce the risk or severity of GVHD). We
are conducting the acute myocardial infarction clinical trial with our partner Angiotech, and we
completed phase I enrollment in the first quarter of 2010. In May&nbsp;2006, we entered into a product
co-development collaboration with Angiotech to jointly develop and ultimately market MultiStem for
the treatment of damage caused by myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to develop and
commercialize MutiStem for the treatment of IBD for the worldwide market. We are currently planning
and preparing for a phase I clinical study in the IBD area and plan to initiate the study as soon
as possible after regulatory approval.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are also independently developing novel orally active pharmaceutical products for the treatment
of obesity and certain central nervous system disorders, including disorders such as narcolepsy,
excessive daytime sleepiness, and chronic fatigue, as well as other potential indications such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Financial</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2007, we completed a merger with BTHC VI, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary that was
formed for the purpose of completing the merger. BTHC VI was a public shell corporation with
substantially no assets, liabilities or operations. We continued as the surviving entity in the
merger and our business became the sole operations of BTHC VI after the merger. BTHC VI&#146;s
acquisition of us effected a change in control and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition
whereby we were the acquirer for financial statement purposes. Accordingly, our financial
statements present our historical results and do not include the historical financial results of
BTHC VI prior to the merger. At the time the merger was effective, each share of common stock of
Athersys was exchanged into 0.0358493 shares of BTHC VI common stock, par value $0.001 per share.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with the merger in June&nbsp;2007, Athersys completed a restructuring of its capital
stock, which included the conversion of the preferred stock into shares of its common stock, the
termination of certain warrants, and the elimination of accrued dividends. As a result, immediately
prior to the consummation of the merger with BTHC VI, all convertible preferred stock (including
termination of warrants and elimination of accrued dividends) was converted into 53,341,747 shares
of common stock and then exchanged for 1,912,356 shares of BTHC VI common stock using the merger
exchange ratio of 0.0358493. The change to the conversion ratios of the convertible preferred
stock was deemed to be an induced conversion, which resulted in a $4.8&nbsp;million deemed dividend and
an increase to the net loss attributable to common stockholders in June&nbsp;2007.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; margin-left: .25in; width: 7.20in">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Immediately after the merger, we completed an offering of 13,000,000 shares of common stock
for aggregate net proceeds of $58.5&nbsp;million in June&nbsp;2007, which included the issuance of warrants
to purchase 3,250,000 shares of common stock to the investors. We also issued warrants to purchase
500,000 shares of common stock to the lead investor and warrants to purchase 1,093,525 shares of
common stock to the placement agents.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Upon the closing of the June&nbsp;2007 offering, bridge investors from 2006 also received five-year
warrants to purchase 132,945 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share, which terms were consistent
with the warrants issued to new investors in the offering.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2007, Athersys terminated the majority of stock option awards and granted options for
3,625,000 shares of common stock under our equity incentive plans to its officers, employees,
directors and consultants with an exercise price of $5.00 per share, resulting in stock
compensation expense of $5.1&nbsp;million in 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have incurred losses since inception of operations in December&nbsp;1995 and had an accumulated
deficit of $194&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2009. Our losses have resulted principally from costs
incurred in research and development, clinical and preclinical product development, acquisition and
licensing costs, and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We have used
the financing proceeds from private equity and debt offerings and other sources of capital to
develop our technologies, to discover and develop therapeutic product candidates and to acquire
certain technologies and assets. We have also built drug development capabilities that have enabled
us to advance product candidates into clinical trials. We have established strategic collaborations
that have provided revenues and capabilities to help further advance our product candidates, and we
have also built a substantial portfolio of intellectual property.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Results of Operations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since our inception, our revenues have consisted of license fees and milestone payments from
our collaborators and grant proceeds primarily from federal and state grants. We have derived no
revenue on the sale of FDA-approved products to date. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of costs associated with external clinical and preclinical study fees, manufacturing
costs, salaries and related personnel costs, legal expenses resulting from intellectual property
application processes, and laboratory supply and reagent costs. We expense research and development
costs as they are incurred. We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and
development to enhance our technologies, advance clinical trials of our product candidates, expand
our regulatory affairs and product development capabilities, conduct preclinical studies of our
products and manufacture our products. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of
salaries and related personnel costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. To date, we
have financed our operations through private equity and debt financing and investments by strategic
collaborators. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through at least the next several
years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The following table sets forth our revenues and expenses for the periods indicated. The
following tables are stated in thousands.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Revenues. </I>Revenues decreased to $2.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 from
$3.1&nbsp;million for 2008. Contract revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 included $171,000 of
revenues from Pfizer in connection with our collaboration agreement entered into in December&nbsp;2009.
We expect our contract revenues related to the Pfizer collaboration in the next few years to
include amortization of the $6.0&nbsp;million license fee over the estimated performance period,
research and development funding, as well as payments for manufacturing and potential milestone
achievement. Also included in contract revenues are license fees and milestone payments from our
collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which decreased in 2009 as a result of a decline in
activity and as a result of a clinical development milestone achieved in September&nbsp;2008. We intend
to continue to prepare and deliver validated drug targets as needed by Bristol-Myers Squibb for use
in its drug discovery efforts, and will remain entitled to receive license fees, milestone payments
and royalties on compounds developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb using our technology. Beyond 2009,
however, we anticipate that Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s demand for new targets will be substantially
reduced or cease altogether. Grant revenue decreased $145,000 primarily due to the completion of a
state grant in 2008 and due to the timing of expenditures that are reimbursed with grant proceeds.
Additionally, our grant revenues could fluctuate during any year based on the timing of
grant-related activities and the award of new grants.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Research and Development Expenses. </I>Research and development expenses decreased to $11.9
million in 2009 from $16.5&nbsp;million in 2008. The decrease of $4.6&nbsp;million related primarily to a
decrease in clinical and preclinical development costs of $6.0&nbsp;million, a decrease in other
research and development expenses of $280,000 and a decrease in patent legal fee expense
of $130,000 in 2009 compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in
personnel costs of $683,000, an increase in stock compensation expense of $569,000, an increase in sponsored research of $485,000, and an increase in research supplies and facilities expenses of
$67,000 in 2009 compared to 2008. Of the $6.0&nbsp;million decrease in clinical and preclinical
development costs, $5.3&nbsp;million related to costs associated with the completion of an ATHX-105
phase I clinical trial in the first half of 2008 and preparations for a phase II clinical trial of
ATHX-105 in 2008, which included several preclinical studies and manufacturing costs. ATHX-105
development was suspended early in 2009 and there will be no future costs incurred for this product
candidate. The remaining $700,000 decrease in clinical and preclinical development costs
related primarily to a $235,000 credit from a renegotiated contract with a contract research
organization in June&nbsp;2009, reduced manufacturing costs associated with our MultiStem clinical
trials, and reduced external costs for regulatory consulting and preclinical studies. Our clinical
costs in 2009 and 2008 are reflected net of Angiotech&#146;s cost-sharing reimbursements related to our
MultiStem acute myocardial infarction collaboration in the amount of $847,000 and $943,000,
respectively. Patent legal fee expense for 2009 decreased compared to 2008, but
continued to be significant as a result of further development and maintaining our portfolio of
patent applications. The increase in personnel costs related to the addition of personnel in
support of our clinical programs and regulatory affairs, a 2009 company-wide performance bonus,
salary increases and increased benefit costs. The increase in stock compensation expense related
to a change in our estimated forfeiture rate, increased expense related to options held by certain
consultants that are computed using variable accounting, and the issuance of stock option awards in
2009. Sponsored research costs increased primarily due to grant-funded programs that require
collaboration with certain academic research institutions. We expect our research and development
expenses to increase in 2010, primarily due to increased MultiStem clinical trial expenses and
support of our Pfizer and Angiotech collaborations. Other than external expenses for our clinical
and preclinical programs, we do not track our research expenses by project; rather, we track such
expenses by the type of cost incurred.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>General and Administrative Expenses. </I>General and administrative expenses increased to $5.6&nbsp;million
in 2009 from $5.5&nbsp;million in 2008. The $100,000 increase was due primarily to an increase in stock
compensation expense of $383,000 and an increase in personnel costs of $249,000, partially offset
by a decrease in other expenses of $331,000, a decrease in legal and professional fees of $116,000
and a decrease in facilities expense of $43,000 in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in stock
compensation expense related to a change in our estimated forfeiture rate and the issuance of stock
option awards in 2009. The increase in personnel costs related to a 2009 company-wide performance
bonus, salary increases and increased benefit costs. The decrease in other expenses for 2009 was
primarily a result of reduced temporary help and outsourced accounting services in 2009. The
decrease in legal and professional fees in 2009 was primarily a result of reduced legal fees
incurred in connection with SEC filings and transactional work. We expect our general and
administrative expenses to continue at similar levels in 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Depreciation. </I>Depreciation expense increased to $233,000 in 2009 from $218,000 in 2008. The increase
in depreciation expense was due to depreciation on capital purchases made in 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Other Expense. </I>Included in other expense for 2009 is an impairment loss of $115,000 related to an
investment in a privately-held company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Interest Income. </I>Interest income decreased to $375,000 in 2009 from $1.1&nbsp;million in 2008. The
change in interest income was due to the decline in cash and investment balances during the period.
While we received $6.0&nbsp;million in fees from Pfizer in 2009, this payment had limited impact on
interest income given its receipt in late December. Due to declining interest rates and lower cash
balances as a result of our ongoing and planned clinical and preclinical development, we expect our
2010 interest income to be less than 2009 absent any new financings or business transactions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Interest Expense. </I>Interest expense decreased to $0 in 2009 from $94,000 in 2008 due to the
repayment of our senior loan in June&nbsp;2008. We do not expect any significant interest expense in
2010.

$3.3&nbsp;million for 2007. Grant revenue decreased $0.6&nbsp;million primarily due to the completion of a
2006 state grant in October&nbsp;2008 as well as the timing of expenditures that are reimbursed with
grant proceeds. License fee revenues increased $0.4&nbsp;million as a result of the nature and timing
of target acceptances under our collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb and the achievement of a clinical development milestone in September&nbsp;2008.

million in 2008 from $15.8&nbsp;million in 2007. The increase of approximately $0.7&nbsp;million related
primarily to an increase in clinical and preclinical development costs of $2.2&nbsp;million, an increase
in patent legal fees of $395,000, an increase in research supplies expenses of $170,000 and an
increase in personnel costs of $111,000 in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were partially
offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of $1.7&nbsp;million, a decrease in other expenses of
$390,000 and a decrease in sponsored research of $72,000 in 2008 compared to 2007. The $2.2
million increase in preclinical and clinical costs was a result of the completion of the ATHX-105
phase I clinical trial, preparations for the ATHX-105 phase II clinical trial, completion of two
additional phase I trials in the United Kingdom, performance of ATHX-105 non-clinical studies, and
increases in MultiStem preclinical and clinical costs and manufacturing expenses. Our clinical
costs in 2008 and 2007 are reflected net of Angiotech&#146;s cost-sharing reimbursements related to our
MultiStem acute myocardial infarction collaboration in the amount of $943,000 and $63,000,
respectively. The increase in patent legal fees for 2008 was a result of maintaining our
growing and maturing portfolio of patent applications, including prosecution costs for several
cases that entered the national phase in 2008. Personnel costs increased due to the addition of
personnel in support of our clinical programs, annual salary increases and increased benefit costs,
which was partially offset by the absence of bonus payments in 2008. The decrease in other
expenses was primarily a result of a milestone payment in 2007 in the amount of $1.0&nbsp;million
associated with a stem cell collaboration milestone and a stem cell IND milestone and was paid to
the former owners of the technology. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in
outsourced research and development expenses. Other than external expenses for our clinical and
preclinical programs, we do not track our research expenses by project; rather, we track such
expenses by the type of cost incurred.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>General and Administrative Expenses. </I>General and administrative expenses decreased to $5.5&nbsp;million
in 2008 from $8.0&nbsp;million in 2007. The $2.5&nbsp;million decrease was due primarily to a decrease in
stock compensation expense of $1.5&nbsp;million, decrease in other expenses of $572,000, decrease in
personnel costs of $261,000, and a decrease in legal and professional fees of $133,000. The
decrease in other expenses for 2008 was primarily as result of a one-time advisory fee of $350,000
in 2007 related to the merger. Personnel costs decreased due to the absence of bonus payments in
2008, which was partially offset by the addition of administrative support personnel, annual salary
increases and increased benefit costs. The decrease in legal and professional fees in 2008 was
primarily a result of reduced legal fees incurred in connection with SEC filings and transactional
work.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Depreciation. </I>Depreciation expense decreased to $218,000 in 2008 from $283,000 in 2007. The
decrease in depreciation expense was due to more laboratory equipment, computer equipment,
furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Other Income. </I>In May&nbsp;2007, Athersys sold certain non-core technology related to its asthma
discovery program to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for $2.0&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Interest Income. </I>Interest income decreased to $1.1&nbsp;million in 2008 from $1.6&nbsp;million in 2007.
The change in interest income was due to the receipt and investment of the proceeds from the equity
offering in June&nbsp;2007, the proceeds of which had declined as they were used to fund operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Interest Expense. </I>Interest expense on Athersys&#146; debt outstanding under its senior loan and
its subordinated convertible promissory notes decreased to $94,000 in 2008 from $1.3&nbsp;million in
2007. The decrease in interest expense was due to the repayment of the senior loan in June&nbsp;2008,
conversion in June&nbsp;2007 of $2.5&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible
promissory notes issued to bridge investors, and conversion in June&nbsp;2007 of $10&nbsp;million in
aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible promissory notes issued to Angiotech.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Accretion of Premium on Convertible Debt. </I>The accretion of premium on convertible debt of
$0.5&nbsp;million in 2007 relates to the $2.5&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated
secured convertible promissory notes issued to bridge investors in 2006 that were converted into
common stock upon the closing of the equity offering in June&nbsp;2007. The notes, if not converted,
were repayable with accrued interest at maturity, plus a repayment fee of 200% of the outstanding
principal. Athersys computed a premium on the debt in the amount of $5.25&nbsp;million due upon redemption, which was being accreted over the term of the notes using the effective interest
method. The unamortized premium was reversed and recorded in additional paid-in-capital when the
notes were converted in June&nbsp;2007.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our sources of liquidity include our cash balances and available-for-sale securities. At
December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had $11.2&nbsp;million in cash and cash equivalents and $15.2&nbsp;million in
available-for-sale securities. Athersys has primarily financed its operations through private
equity and debt financings that have resulted in aggregate cumulative proceeds of approximately
$200&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to develop and
commercialize MutiStem for the treatment of IBD for the worldwide market. Under the terms of the
agreement, we received an up-front cash payment of $6&nbsp;million from Pfizer and will receive research
funding and support during the initial phase of the collaboration. In addition, we are also
eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $105&nbsp;million upon the successful achievement of
certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, though there can be no assurance that we
will achieve any milestones. We will be responsible for manufacturing and Pfizer will pay us for
manufacturing product for clinical development and commercialization purposes. Pfizer will have
responsibility for development, regulatory and commercialization and will pay us tiered royalties
on worldwide commercial sales of MultiStem IBD products. Alternatively, in lieu of royalties and
certain commercialization milestones, we may elect to co-develop with Pfizer and the parties will
share development and commercialization expenses and profits/losses on an agreed basis beginning at
phase III clinical development.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with our MultiStem collaboration with Angiotech, upon the successful achievement of
specified clinical development and commercialization milestones, we may also receive up to
$3.75&nbsp;million of additional equity investments and $63.75&nbsp;million of aggregate cash payments,
though there can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones. Under the terms of the
collaboration, the parties are jointly funding clinical development activity, whereby preclinical
costs are borne solely by us, costs for phase I and phase II clinical trials are borne 50% by us
and 50% by Angiotech, costs for the first phase III clinical trial will be borne 33% by us and 67%
by Angiotech, and costs for any phase III clinical trials subsequent to the first phase III
clinical trial will be borne 25% by us and 75% by Angiotech. We have lead responsibility for
preclinical and early clinical development and manufacturing of the MultiStem product, and
Angiotech will take the lead on later clinical trials and commercialization. Late in 2007, the
parties began to share costs for phase I clinical development, which is reconciled quarterly. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2009, $229,000 was due from Angiotech representing its share of costs for the
fourth quarter of 2009. Upon product commercialization, we will receive nearly half of the net
profits from the sale of any jointly developed, approved products.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which was initially established in 2001, is
now in its final phase. In September&nbsp;2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb successfully advanced into phase
II clinical development a drug candidate discovered using a target provided by us, thereby
triggering a clinical development milestone payment to us. We intend to continue to prepare and
deliver validated drug targets as needed by Bristol-Myers Squibb for use in its drug discovery
efforts. We will remain entitled to receive license fees for targets delivered to Bristol-Myers
Squibb, as well as milestone payments and royalties on compounds developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb
using our technology, though there can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones or
royalties. Beyond 2009, we anticipate that Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s demand for new targets will be
substantially reduced or cease altogether.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our available-for-sale securities typically include United States government obligations,
commercial paper and corporate debt securities. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, approximately 83% of our
investments were in United States government obligations, including government-backed agencies. We
have been investing conservatively due to the ongoing economic conditions and have prioritized
liquidity and the preservation of principal in lieu of potentially higher returns. As a result, we
have experienced no losses on the principal of our investments and have held our investments until
maturity. Also, although these unfavorable market and economic conditions have resulted in a
decrease to our market capitalization, there has been no impairment to the value of our assets.
Our fixed assets are used for internal research and development and, therefore, are not impacted by
these external factors.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We will require substantial additional funding in order to continue our research and product
development programs, including preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates.
We expect to have available cash to fund our operations through 2011 based on our current business
and operational plans and assuming no new financings or significant business transactions. Our
funding requirements may change at any time due to technological advances or competition from other
companies. Our future capital requirements will also depend on numerous other factors, including
scientific progress in our research and development programs, additional personnel costs, progress
in preclinical testing and clinical trials, the time and cost related to proposed regulatory
approvals, if any, and the costs in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing patent
claims. We cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available to us or, if available, that
it will be available on acceptable terms, particularly in light of the current credit crisis. Any
shortfall in funding could result in our having to curtail our research and development efforts.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through at least the next several years and may
incur losses in subsequent periods. The amount and timing of our future losses are highly
uncertain. Our ability to achieve and thereafter sustain profitability will be dependent upon,
among other things, successfully developing, commercializing and obtaining regulatory approval or
clearances for our technologies and products resulting from these technologies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net cash used in operating activities was $4.6&nbsp;million, $15.7&nbsp;million and $12.1&nbsp;million in
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and represented the use of cash in funding clinical and
preclinical product development activities. We expect that net cash used in operating activities
will increase in 2010 in connection with increased research and development expenses of our
MultiStem clinical trials and our Pfizer and Angiotech collaborations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net cash provided by investing activities was $3.2&nbsp;million in 2009 and $16.8&nbsp;million in 2008.
Net cash used in investing activities was $36.4&nbsp;million in 2007. The fluctuations from period to
period are due to the timing of purchases and maturity dates of investments and the purchase of
equipment. Purchases of equipment were $381,000, $532,000 and $161,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. We expect that our capital equipment expenditures will continue at similar levels in
2010 compared to 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Financing activities neither used nor provided cash in 2009, used cash of $1.8&nbsp;million in
2008, and provided cash of $60.2&nbsp;million in 2007. These fluctuations relate primarily to proceeds
from the equity offering in June&nbsp;2007, the issuance of a convertible promissory note in 2007 to
Angiotech, and repayments of our senior loan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Investors in the equity offering in June&nbsp;2007 received five-year warrants to purchase an
aggregate of 3,250,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $6.00 per share. The lead
investor in the June offering, Radius Venture Partners, invested $10.0&nbsp;million and received
additional five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 500,000 shares of common stock with a
cash or cashless exercise price of $6.00 per share. The placement agents for the June offering
received five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,093,525 shares of common stock with a
cash or cashless exercise price of $6.00 per share. The exercise of such warrants could provide us
with cash proceeds. No warrants have been exercised at December&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our senior loan was repaid in full in June&nbsp;2008. The senior lenders retain a right to receive
a milestone payment of $2.25&nbsp;million upon the occurrence of certain events as follows: (1)&nbsp;the
entire amount upon (a)&nbsp;the merger with or into another entity where our stockholders do not hold at
least a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity, (b)&nbsp;the sale of all or substantially
all of our assets, or (c)&nbsp;our liquidation or dissolution; or (2)&nbsp;a portion of the amount from
proceeds of equity financings not tied to specific research and development activities that are
part of a research or development collaboration, in which case, the senior lenders will receive an
amount equal to 10% of proceeds above $5.0&nbsp;million in cumulative gross proceeds until the milestone
amount is paid in full. The milestone payment is payable in cash, except that if the milestone
event is (2)&nbsp;above, we may elect to pay 75% of the milestone in shares of common stock at the
per-share offering price. No milestone events have occurred as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. The senior
lenders also received warrants to purchase 149,026 shares of common stock with an exercise price of
$5.00 upon the closing of our equity offering in June&nbsp;2007. The exercise of such warrants could
provide us with cash proceeds. No warrants were exercised at December&nbsp;31, 2009.

stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in the offering (as well as the 531,781 shares
of common stock issued to the bridge investors and the 132,945 shares underlying their warrants).
The resale registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October&nbsp;18, 2007. Under the
registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the offering, subject to certain
exceptions, if the resale registration statement ceases to remain effective, a 1% cash penalty will
be assessed for each 30-day period until the registration statement becomes effective again, capped
at 10% of the aggregate gross proceeds we received from the equity offering. Because the penalty
is based on the number of unregistered shares of common stock held by investors in the offering,
our maximum penalty exposure will decline over time as investors sell their shares of common stock
that were included in the registration statement.

are based on Athersys&#146; consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we

judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our license and collaboration agreements may contain multiple elements,
including license and technology access fees, research and development funding,
manufacturing revenue, cost-sharing, milestones and royalties. The deliverables
under such an arrangement are evaluated under Accounting Standards
Codification, or ASC, 605-25, <I>Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>, (which originated
primarily from the guidance in EITF 00-21) to assess whether they have
standalone value and objective and reliable evidence of fair value, and if so,
are accounted for as a single unit. We then recognize revenue for each unit
based on the culmination of the earnings process under ASC 605-S25 (issued as
SAB Topic 13) and our estimated performance period for the single units of
accounting based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement. We
subsequently adjust the estimated performance periods, if appropriate, on a
prospective basis based upon available facts and circumstances. Future changes
in estimates of the performance period may materially impact the timing of
future revenue recognized. Amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue
recognition criteria for contract revenues are recorded as deferred revenue in

accounted for using collaboration accounting) paid to us are recorded on a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer in December&nbsp;2009 that
contains multiple elements and deliverables. For a description of the
collaboration agreement and the determination of contract revenues, see Note E
to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form
10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Also included in contract revenue are license fees received from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which are
specifically set forth in the license and collaboration agreement as amounts due to us based on our
completion of certain tasks (e.g., delivery and acceptance of a cell line) and development
milestones (e.g., clinical trial phases), and as such, are not based on estimates that are
susceptible to change. Such amounts are invoiced and recorded as revenue as tasks are completed
and as milestones are achieved.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Similarly, grant revenue consists of funding under cost reimbursement programs primarily from
federal and state sources for qualified research and development activities performed by us, and
as such, are not based on estimates that are susceptible to change. Such amounts are invoiced
(unless prepaid) and recorded as revenue as tasks are completed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Collaborative Arrangements</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Collaborative arrangements that involve cost or future profit sharing are reviewed to determine the
nature of the arrangement and the nature of the collaborative parties&#146; businesses. The
arrangements are also reviewed to determine if one party has sole or primary responsibility for an
activity, or whether the parties have shared responsibility for the activity. If responsibility
for an activity is shared and there is no principal party, then the related costs of that activity
are recognized by us on a net basis in the statement of operations (e.g., total cost, less
reimbursement from collaborator). If we are deemed to be the principal party for an activity, then
the costs and revenues associated with that activity are recognized on a gross basis in the
statement of operations. The accounting may be susceptible to change if the nature of a
collaborator&#146;s business changes. Currently, our only collaboration accounted for on a net basis is
our cost-sharing collaboration with Angiotech.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Clinical Trial Costs</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Clinical trial costs are accrued based on work performed by outside contractors who manage and
perform the trials. We obtain initial estimates of total costs based on enrollment of subjects,
project management estimates and other activities. Actual costs are typically charged to us and
recognized as the tasks are completed by the contractor. Accrued clinical trial costs may be
subject to revisions as clinical trials progress, and any revisions are recorded in the period in
which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. Since such actual costs are
typically invoiced as incurred or based on contractual amounts for services rendered, the amounts
are generally not susceptible to significant changes in estimates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Investments in Available-for-Sale Securities</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We determine the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase and
re-evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investments typically consist
primarily of United States government obligations, commercial paper and corporate debt securities,
which are classified as available-for-sale and are valued based on quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets (Level 1). Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income.
Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income. The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest earned on
securities classified as available-for-sale is included in interest income. Since the elements related to accounting for these investments are reflected on monthly statements,
the amounts are not based on estimates that are susceptible to change. None of our financial
assets are in markets that are not active.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We recognize stock-based compensation expense on the straight-line method and use a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of share-based awards. The expected
term of options granted represent the period of time that option grants are expected to be
outstanding. We use the &#147;simplified&#148; method to calculate the expected life of option grants given
our limited history and determine volatility by using the historical stock volatility of other
companies with similar characteristics. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict
actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and if our expectations on forfeitures changes. If
actual forfeitures vary from the estimate, we will recognize the difference in compensation expense
in the period the actual forfeitures occur or when options vest.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of the aforementioned estimates and assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis and may
change as facts and circumstances warrant. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the
estimate of the fair value of our share-based payments and the related amount recognized in our
financial statements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued guidance (issued
as EITF Issue No.&nbsp;07-1) related to accounting for collaborative arrangements codified in ASC 808,
<I>Collaborative Arrangements</I>. The effective date of the guidance was January&nbsp;1, 2009 for calendar
year companies with retrospective application required for all periods presented for collaborative
arrangements existing as of the effective date. ASC 808 requires certain disclosures related to
collaborative arrangements where parties are active participants and exposed to significant risks
and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. The adoption of the new guidance
did not have a material impact on our financial statements because our accounting for our
collaborative agreement with Angiotech was consistent with the standard&#146;s provisions.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued clarifying guidance (issued as EITF Issue No.&nbsp;07-5) related to
determining whether an instrument is indexed to an entity&#146;s own stock, codified in ASC 815,
<I>Derivative and Hedging</I>. The new guidance was effective for us on January&nbsp;1, 2009. The adoption of
the new guidance had no impact on our financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance (issued as Staff Position FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2) related
to the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, codified in ASC 320,
<I>Investments-Debt and Equity Securities</I>. The guidance requires, among other things, that
other-than-temporary impairments be separated into the amount recognized in earnings and the amount
recognized in other comprehensive income. The guidance was effective for us on June&nbsp;30, 2009. The
adoption of the new guidance had no impact on our financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued additional guidance (issued as FSP 157-4) related to determining
fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly
decreased in relation to normal market activity and required additional disclosures about fair
value measurements in annual and interim reporting periods, which was codified in ASC 820, <I>Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures</I>. The standard also provides guidance on circumstances that may
indicate that a transaction is not orderly. This additional guidance within ASC 820 was effective
for us on June&nbsp;30, 2009. The adoption of the additional guidance had no impact on our financial
statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued additional guidance (issued as SFAS No.&nbsp;165), codified in ASC 855,
<I>Subsequent Events, </I>related to subsequent events and provides authoritative guidance regarding
subsequent events as this guidance was previously only addressed in auditing literature. The
additional guidance was effective for us on June&nbsp;30, 2009 and its adoption had no impact on our
financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued guidance (issued as Staff Position APB 14-1) related to accounting for
convertible debt that may be settled in cash upon conversion, codified in ASC 470-20, <I>Debt with
Conversion and Other Options</I>. The new guidance requires the issuer of certain convertible debt
instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion to separately account for the liability and
equity components in a manner that reflects the issuer&#146;s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. We
have no current convertible debt instruments, and concluded that all of our prior instruments were
not within the scope of the new guidance; therefore, there was no retrospective effect from the
adoption of the new guidance on our financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2009, ASC 605-25, <I>Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>, was updated (ASU No.&nbsp;2009-13) related
to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple elements. The new guidance is effective for
our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, however, early adoption is
permitted provided that the new guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of
adoption. We have not yet evaluated the potential effect of the future adoption of this new
guidance.

Fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from
changes in interest rates. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall
short of expectations. Further, we may suffer losses in investment principal if we are forced to
sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. We invest our
excess cash primarily in debt instruments of the United States government and its agencies,
commercial paper and corporate debt securities. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, approximately 83% of our
investments were in United States government obligations, including government-backed agencies. We
have been investing conservatively due to the current economic conditions, including the current
credit crisis, and have prioritized liquidity and the preservation of principal in lieu of
potentially higher returns. As a result, we have experienced no losses on the principal of our
investments.

Athersys, Inc.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Athersys, Inc. as of December&nbsp;31,
2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We
were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.
Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Athersys, Inc. at December&nbsp;31, 2009 and
2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

</DIV>

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic products
in one business segment. Operations consist primarily of research and product development
activities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On June&nbsp;8, 2007, our subsidiary, which was then named Athersys, Inc. (&#147;Old Athersys&#148;), effected a
merger into a wholly-owned subsidiary of a public company (the &#147;Merger&#148;). The public company, BTHC
VI, Inc. (&#147;BTHC VI&#148;), was a shell corporation with no assets, liabilities or operations as of the
date of the Merger. Upon completion of the Merger, the officers and directors of Old Athersys
assumed control over the operations of BTHC VI, and Old Athersys&#146; operations became the sole
operations of BTHC VI on a consolidated basis. In August&nbsp;2007, BTHC VI changed its name to
Athersys, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;us&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Prior to the consummation of the Merger, Old Athersys completed a restructuring of its capital
stock, which included the conversion of its preferred stock into shares of Old Athersys&#146; common
stock, termination of certain warrants and the elimination of accrued dividends. As a result,
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, all convertible preferred stock (including
termination of warrants and elimination of accrued dividends) was converted into 53,341,747 shares
of common stock and then exchanged for 1,912,356 shares of BTHC VI common stock using the Merger
exchange ratio of 0.0358493. The change to the conversion ratios of the convertible preferred
stock was deemed to be an induced conversion, which resulted in a $4.8&nbsp;million deemed dividend and
an increase to the net loss attributable to common stockholders in June&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">BTHC VI&#146;s acquisition of Old Athersys effected a change in control and was accounted for as a
reverse acquisition whereby Old Athersys is the accounting acquirer for financial statement
purposes. Accordingly, our financial statements as presented reflect the historical results of
Old Athersys and do not include the historical financial results of BTHC VI prior to the
consummation of the Merger.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Immediately after the Merger, we completed an offering of 13,000,000 shares of common stock for net
proceeds of $58.5&nbsp;million (the &#147;Offering&#148;). The Offering included the issuance of warrants to
purchase 3,250,000 shares of common stock to the investors with an exercise price of $6.00 and a
five-year term. We also issued warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common stock to the lead
investor and warrants to purchase 1,093,525 shares of common stock to the placement agents, all
with an exercise price of $6.00.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Upon the closing of the Offering, bridge investors from 2006 also received five-year warrants to
purchase 132,945 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share, which terms were consistent with the
warrants issued to new investors in the Offering.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We filed a resale registration statement with the SEC for 18,508,251 shares of common stock, which
includes all shares of common stock issued in the Offering and shares of common stock issuable upon
exercise of the warrants issued in the Offering (as well as the 531,781 shares of common stock
issued to the bridge investors and the 132,945 shares underlying their warrants). The resale
registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October&nbsp;18, 2007. Under the purchase
agreement for the Offering, subject to certain exceptions, if the resale registration statement
ceases to remain effective, a 1% cash penalty will be assessed for each 30-day period until the
registration statement becomes effective again, capped at 10% of the aggregate gross proceeds
received in the Offering. Because the penalty is based on the number of unregistered shares of
common stock held by investors in the Offering, our maximum penalty exposure will decline over time
as investors sell their shares of common stock that were included in the registration statement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2007, Old Athersys sold certain non-core technology related to its asthma drug discovery program
to a pharmaceutical company for $2.0&nbsp;million, which was recognized as a gain on the sale in other
income in 2007.

culmination of the earnings process under ASC 605-S25 (issued as SAB Topic 13)

on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement. We subsequently adjust
the estimated performance periods, if appropriate, on a prospective basis based

recognized. Amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Research and development expenditures, which consist primarily of costs associated with external
clinical and preclinical study fees, manufacturing costs, salaries and related personnel costs,
legal expenses resulting from intellectual property application processes, and laboratory supply

incurred.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Collaborative arrangements that involve cost or future profit sharing are reviewed to determine the
nature of the arrangement and the nature of the collaborative parties&#146; businesses. The
arrangements are also reviewed to determine if one party has sole or primary responsibility for an
activity, or whether the parties have shared responsibility for the activity. If responsibility
for an activity is shared and there is no principal party, then the related costs of that activity
are recognized by us on a net basis in the statement of operations (e.g., total cost, less
reimbursement
from collaborator). If we are deemed to be the principal party for an activity, then the costs and
revenues associated with that activity are recognized on a gross basis in the statement of
operations. The accounting may be susceptible to change if the nature of a collaborator&#146;s business
changes. Currently, our only collaboration accounted for on a net basis is our cost-sharing
collaboration with Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Angiotech&#148;).

perform the trials. We obtain initial estimates of total costs based on enrollment of subjects,
project management estimates and other activities. Actual costs are typically charged to us and
recognized as the tasks are completed by the contractor. Accrued clinical trial costs may be
subject to revisions as clinical trials progress, and any revisions are recorded in the period in
which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We determine the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase and
re-evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investments typically consist of
U.S. government obligations, commercial paper and corporate debt securities, which are classified
as available-for-sale and are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
(Level 1). Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of applicable tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income. Realized
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income. The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest earned on securities
classified as available-for-sale is included in interest income. None of our financial assets are
in markets that are not active.
</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Equipment is stated at acquired cost less accumulated depreciation. Laboratory and office equipment
are depreciated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (three to seven years).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset or related group of assets may not be recoverable. If the
expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recognized at that time. Measurement of impairment may be based upon appraisal,

option-pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of share-based awards. The expected
term of options granted represent the period of time that option grants are expected to be
outstanding. We use the &#147;simplified&#148; method to calculate the expected life of option grants given
our limited history and determine volatility by using the historical stock volatility of other
companies with similar characteristics. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict
actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards.

occur or when options vest.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued guidance (issued as EITF
Issue No.&nbsp;07-1) related to accounting for collaborative arrangements, codified in ASC 808,
<I>Collaborative Arrangements</I>. The effective date of the guidance was January&nbsp;1, 2009 for calendar
year companies with retrospective application required for all periods presented for collaborative
arrangements existing as of the effective date. ASC 808 requires certain disclosures related to
collaborative arrangements where parties are active participants and exposed to significant risks
and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. The adoption of the new guidance
did not have a material impact on our financial statements because our accounting for our
collaborative agreement with Angiotech was consistent with the standard&#146;s provisions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued clarifying guidance (issued as EITF Issue No.&nbsp;07-5) related to
determining whether an instrument is indexed to an entity&#146;s own stock, codified in ASC 815,
<I>Derivative and Hedging</I>. The new guidance was effective for us on January&nbsp;1, 2009. The adoption of
the new guidance had no impact on our financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued guidance (issued as Staff Position FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2) related
to the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, codified in ASC 320,
<I>Investments-Debt and Equity Securities</I>. The guidance requires, among other things, that
other-than-temporary impairments be separated into the amount recognized in earnings and the amount
recognized in other comprehensive income. The guidance was effective for us on June&nbsp;30, 2009. The
adoption of the new guidance had no impact on our financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In April&nbsp;2009, the FASB issued additional guidance (issued as FSP 157-4) related to determining
fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly
decreased in relation to normal market activity and required additional disclosures about fair
value measurements in annual and interim reporting periods, which was codified in ASC 820, <I>Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures</I>. The standard also provides guidance on circumstances that may
indicate that a transaction is not orderly. This additional guidance within ASC 820 was effective
for us on June&nbsp;30, 2009. The adoption of the additional guidance had no impact on our financial
statements.

<I>Subsequent Events, </I>related to subsequent events and provides authoritative guidance regarding
subsequent events as this guidance was previously only addressed in auditing literature. The
additional guidance was effective for us on June&nbsp;30, 2009 and its adoption had no impact on our

accounting for convertible debt that may be settled in cash upon conversion, codified in ASC

certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion to separately
account for the liability and equity components in a manner that reflects the issuer&#146;s
nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. We have no current convertible debt instruments, and concluded
that all of our prior instruments were not within the scope of the new guidance; therefore, there
was no retrospective effect from the adoption of the new guidance on our financial statements.

effective for our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, however, early
adoption is permitted provided that the new guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of
the year of adoption. We have not yet evaluated the potential effect of the future

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We lease office and laboratory space under an operating lease and have options to renew the lease
in annual increments through March&nbsp;2013 at the initial rental rate. We executed options to renew
through March&nbsp;2011. Also, we entered into a three-year lease agreement for office and laboratory
space for our Belgian subsidiary through December&nbsp;2010, which includes options to renew annually
through December&nbsp;2014. The annual rent is subject to adjustments based on an inflationary index,
and the lease included an option to expand that was exercised in 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Aggregate rent expense was approximately $337,000 in 2009, $314,000 in 2008, and $267,000 in 2007.
The future annual minimum lease commitments at December&nbsp;31, 2009 are approximately $359,000 for
2010 and $67,000 for 2011.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our former lenders retain a right to receive a milestone payment of $2.25&nbsp;million upon the
occurrence of certain events as follows: (1)&nbsp;the entire amount upon (a)&nbsp;the merger with or into
another entity where our stockholders do not hold at least a majority of the voting power of the
surviving entity, (b)&nbsp;the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or (c)&nbsp;our liquidation or
dissolution; or (2)&nbsp;a portion of the amount from proceeds of equity financings not tied to specific
research and development activities that are part of a research or development collaboration, in
which case, the lenders will receive an amount equal to 10% of proceeds above $5.0&nbsp;million in
cumulative gross proceeds until the milestone amount is paid in full. The milestone payment is
payable in cash, except that if the milestone event is (2)&nbsp;above, we may elect to pay 75% of the
milestone in shares of common stock at the per-share offering price. No amounts have been recorded
for the milestone in December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 or 2007. We paid interest of $0, $76,000 and $456,000
during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The former lenders also received warrants to purchase 149,026 shares of common stock with an
exercise price of $5.00 per share and a seven-year term upon the closing of the Offering in June
2007 in accordance with the loan agreement. The value of the warrants was $492,000 based on the
Black-Scholes valuation of the underlying security, of which $16,000 and $476,000 was recorded as
interest expense in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

to treat inflammatory bowel disease (&#147;IBD&#148;) for the worldwide market. Under the terms of the
agreement, we received an up-front license and technology access payment of $6.0&nbsp;million from
Pfizer and will receive research funding and support during the initial phase of the collaboration,
which began in December&nbsp;2009 and is estimated to be completed in 2012. In addition, we are also
eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $105&nbsp;million upon the successful achievement of
certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, for which we evaluated the nature of the
events triggering these contingent payments and concluded that these events constituted substantive
milestones that will be recognized as revenue in the period in which the underlying triggering
event occurs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We will be responsible for manufacturing and Pfizer will pay us for manufacturing product for
clinical development and commercialization purposes. Pfizer will have responsibility for
development, regulatory and commercialization and will pay us tiered royalties on worldwide
commercial sales of MultiStem IBD products. Alternatively, in lieu of royalties and certain
commercialization milestones, we may elect to co-develop with Pfizer and the parties will share
development and commercialization expenses and profits/losses on an agreed basis beginning at phase
III clinical development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We evaluated the facts and circumstances of the agreement to determine whether the Pfizer agreement
had obligations constituting deliverables and concluded that it had multiple deliverables,
including deliverables relating to the grant of a license and access to our technology, performance
of research and development services, and performance of certain manufacturing services, and
concluded that these deliverables should be combined into a single unit of accounting. We will
recognize the license and technology access fee and research and development funding ratably on a
straight-line basis over the estimated performance period, which began in December&nbsp;2009 and is
estimated to be completed in 2012, and will recognize manufacturing revenue as the services are
performed. Prepaid license and technology access fee and prepaid research and development funding
is recorded as deferred revenue and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the research period.

promissory notes to Angiotech in the principal amounts of $5.0&nbsp;million in 2006 at inception and
$5.0&nbsp;million in 2007 upon the achievement of a milestone. Upon the closing of the Offering, the
convertible notes were converted along with accrued interest into common stock at a conversion
price of 110% of the price per share in the Offering, in accordance with the terms of the notes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We determined that neither party is a principal party for clinical development costs, since both
the costs and responsibilities are shared and neither party is in the business of conducting
clinical development services for others. Therefore, we record clinical development costs net of
Angiotech&#146;s 50% cost-share, which amounted to $847,000, $943,000, and $63,000 in 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively. The amount due from Angiotech was $229,000 and $234,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2009

<!-- xbrl,body -->

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2007, we adopted two incentive plans that authorized an aggregate of 4,500,000 shares of common
stock for awards to employees, directors and consultants. These equity incentive plans authorize
the issuance of equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and units, and other stock-based
awards to qualified employees, directors and consultants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2007, the majority of Old Athersys&#146; pre-Merger outstanding options were terminated. We
accounted for the termination of these awards as a settlement and all previously unrecognized
compensation expense ($385,000) was recognized on the termination date in 2007. New option awards
to purchase 3,625,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $5.00 per share were granted
to employees, directors and consultants in June&nbsp;2007 upon the closing of the Merger. The options
that were granted to employees generally vested 40% on the date of grant and vest ratably over
three years. The options granted to non-employees and board members generally vest at varying
percentages over three years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Prior to the Merger in 2007, Old Athersys maintained equity incentive plans in which 277,000 shares
were available for issuance. Upon the closing of the Merger, BTHC VI assumed 5,052 of these
options, which will be governed by Old Athersys&#146; original equity plans until the awards expire. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2009, 2,149 of these assumed awards remain outstanding. All of the remaining
outstanding option awards under Old Athersys&#146; former equity incentive plans were terminated prior
to the Merger.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, a total of 501,000 shares were available for issuance under our equity
compensation plans and options to purchase 4,001,149 shares of common stock were outstanding
(including the assumed options covering 2,149 shares described above). We recognized $2,808,000,
$1,856,000 and $5,139,000 of stock compensation expense in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which
included approximately $264,000 in 2009 related to a change in estimate of our forfeiture rate. At
December&nbsp;31, 2009, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to unvested stock options
was approximately $1,600,000, which is expected to be recognized by March&nbsp;31, 2013 using the
straight-line method.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The
weighted average fair value of option shares granted in 2009, 2008
and 2007 was $2.04, $2.00
and $2.82 per share, respectively. The total fair value of option shares vested in 2009, 2008 and
2007 was $2,257,000, $2,337,000 and $4,742,000, respectively. There is no aggregate intrinsic
value of fully vested option shares and option shares expected to vest as of December&nbsp;31, 2009
since the market value was less than the exercise price of the options at the end of the year.
