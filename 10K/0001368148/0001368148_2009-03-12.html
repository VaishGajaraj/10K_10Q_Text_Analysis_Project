<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic product
candidates designed to extend and enhance the quality of human life. Through the application of our
proprietary technologies, we have established a pipeline of therapeutic product development
programs in multiple disease areas. We are committed to developing therapeutic products that we
believe have best-in-class potential, meaning therapeutic candidates that have the potential to be
safer, more effective products than the current standard of care or other products in development,
and that may have other advantages, such as superior scalability or ease of administration.
Our current product development portfolio consists of MultiStem<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>, a patented and
proprietary stem cell product that we are developing as a treatment for multiple disease
indications, and that is currently being evaluated in two ongoing clinical trials. In addition, we
are developing novel pharmaceuticals to treat indications such as obesity, certain cognitive and
attention disorders, narcolepsy or other forms of excessive daytime sleepiness.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">MultiStem is a biologic product that is manufactured from human stem cells obtained from adult bone
marrow or other nonembryonic tissue sources. The product consists of a special class of human stem
cells that have the ability to express a range of therapeutically relevant proteins and other
factors, as well as form multiple cell types. Factors expressed by MultiStem have the potential to
deliver a therapeutic benefit in several ways, such as the reduction of inflammation, protection of
damaged or injured tissue, and the formation of new blood vessels in regions of ischemic injury.
These cells exhibit a drug-like profile in that they act primarily through the production of
factors that regulate the immune system, protect damaged or injured cells, promote tissue repair
and healing and most or all of the cells are cleared from the body over time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">During several years of preclinical work, MultiStem has demonstrated the potential to address each
of the fundamental limitations observed with traditional bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell
transplants. These limitations include the historical requirement for tissue matching between
donor and patient, the typical need for one donor for each patient (a reflection of the inability
to expand cells in a controlled and reproducible manner), frequent use of immune suppressive drugs
to avoid rejection or immune system complications, and a range of other potential safety issues.
Unlike other cell types, MultiStem cells, after isolation from a qualified donor, may be expanded
on a large scale for future clinical use and stored in frozen form until needed. Cells obtained
from a single donor require no genetic modification and may be used to produce banks yielding
hundreds of thousands to millions of doses of MultiStem &#151; an amount far greater than other stem
cell types.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that MultiStem represents a potential best-in-class stem cell therapy because it
exhibits each of the following characteristics based on research and development to date: (1)&nbsp;it
may be produced on an industrial scale, in a well validated and reproducible manner; (2)&nbsp;it may be
administered without tissue matching or the need for immune suppressive drugs, making it analogous
to type O blood; (3)&nbsp;it exhibits a consistent safety profile; and (4)&nbsp;it appears capable of
delivering a therapeutic benefit through more than one mechanism of action. Factors expressed by
MultiStem are believed to reduce inflammation and regulate immune system function, protect damaged
or injured cells and tissue, promote formation of new blood vessels, and augment tissue repair and
healing in other ways. Based upon work that we and independent collaborators have conducted over
the past several years, we believe that MultiStem has the potential to treat a range of disease
indications, including ischemic injury and cardiovascular disease, certain neurological diseases,
autoimmune disease, transplant support (including in oncology patients), and a range of orphan
disease indications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with independent investigators, we have conducted preclinical studies in relevant animal
models designed to evaluate safety and potential therapeutic benefit in various disease
indications. Based on the results of these and other studies, we advanced two MultiStem programs
into clinical development in 2008, initiating phase I clinical trials in cardiovascular
disease (treating patients that have suffered an acute myocardial infarction) and in oncology
treatment support (administering MultiStem to leukemia or lymphoma patients who are receiving a
traditional bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell, or HSC, transplant to reduce the risk or
severity of graft versus host disease, or GVHD). We are conducting the acute myocardial infarction
clinical trial with our partner Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Angiotech. In May&nbsp;2006, we
entered into a product co-development collaboration with Angiotech to jointly develop and
ultimately market MultiStem for the treatment of damage caused by myocardial infarction and
peripheral vascular disease. Under the terms of the collaboration, the parties are jointly funding
clinical development activities, whereby preclinical costs are borne solely by Athersys, costs for
phase I and phase II clinical trials are borne 50% by Athersys and 50% by Angiotech, costs for the
first phase III clinical trial will be borne 33% by Athersys and 67% by Angiotech, and costs for
any phase III clinical trials subsequent to the first phase III clinical trial will be borne 25% by
Athersys and 75% by Angiotech. We will receive nearly half of the net profits from the sale of any
jointly developed, approved products. In addition, we retain the exclusive commercial rights to the
development of MultiStem for other indication areas, including oncology treatment support,
neurological indications, autoimmune disease, and other areas.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; margin-left: .25in; width: 7.20in">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2008, we were granted authorization by the United States Food and Drug Administration,
or FDA, to initiate a third clinical trial, administering MultiStem for the treatment of ischemic
stroke. According to recent American Heart Association estimates, over 700,000 patients suffered
an ischemic stroke in the United States in 2008. Current drug therapy for treating an ischemic
stroke is limited to administration of the clot dissolving drug tPA. According to current clinical
guidelines, tPA must be administered to stroke patients within three hours after the occurrence of
the ischemic stroke in order to remove the clot while minimizing potential risks, such as bleeding
into the brain. However, many strokes occur at night or during a time
where immediate diagnosis and  medical treatment is not available, and as a result, only a very small percentage of ischemic stroke
patients are treated with tPA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In preclinical studies conducted by Athersys and its collaborators, a single dose of MultiStem
administered intravenously has demonstrated the potential to safely deliver a significant
therapeutic benefit even when administered several days after an ischemic stroke has occurred. We
believe that this benefit is achieved through several mechanisms, including reduction of
inflammation and immune system modulation in the ischemic area and the protection and rescue of
damaged or injured cells, including neuronal tissue. The phase I safety clinical trial authorized
by the FDA is a double blind, placebo controlled study that allows for administration of MultiStem
to patients 48 to 60 hours after the ischemic stroke, which, if shown to be safe and effective,
would represent a significant extension of the treatment window relative to existing standard of
care.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working
with partners and collaborators, and as resources permit, we intend to explore the
potential utility of MultiStem for treating a range of other conditions, including autoimmune
diseases, other conditions that involve the immune system, and certain neurological conditions,
especially those in which inflammation plays a role. We believe that MultiStem could have utility
in treating multiple diseases, and as a result, has the potential to create significant value for
our Company and our stockholders.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to our MultiStem programs, we are developing pharmaceuticals for the treatment of
obesity and certain neurological conditions associated with
cognition, attention and wakefulness. In the
obesity area, we are developing compounds that selectively stimulate the 5HT2c serotonin receptor
in the brain, which is known to play an important role in regulating appetite. These compounds,
known as 5HT2c agonists, are designed to reduce appetite and food intake, in order to achieve
substantial weight loss over time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have completed several clinical trials involving ATHX-105, a potent and selective 5HT2c receptor
agonist that was being developed for the treatment of obesity. In July&nbsp;2007, we initiated a phase
I clinical trial for ATHX-105 in the United Kingdom. The primary objective of the phase I clinical
trial was to assess the short-term safety of ATHX-105 and to establish an appropriate dose range
for subsequent clinical trials that will be conducted in order to assess safety and effectiveness.
The phase I clinical trial, which included 107 subjects, was completed in January&nbsp;2008, and top
line results were announced shortly after completion of the study.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The results of the study demonstrated that ATHX-105 was well-absorbed, resulting in good drug
exposures following oral administration, and was generally well tolerated up to a maximum tolerated
dose of 100 mg. There were no severe or serious adverse events observed in the clinical trial, no
negative effects on cardiovascular, hematology or other clinical parameters, and no
discontinuations due to adverse events. In addition to this study, we completed two phase I
clinical trials in the United Kingdom to further assess safety and tolerability of ATHX-105
administered at various dose levels, as well as examine regional absorption of the drug in the
gastrointestinal tract for the purpose of developing a formulated product.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; margin-left: .25in; width: 7.20in">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Based upon the results of these and other studies, we applied to the FDA in the summer of 2008 to
initiate a double blind, placebo controlled phase II clinical trial involving administration of
ATHX-105 to patients in the United States. In September&nbsp;2008, following the FDA&#146;s review of our
investigational new drug application, or IND, the proposed trial was placed on partial clinical
hold pending the receipt of additional information and resolution of several issues relating to
ATHX-105&#146;s preclinical package and the proposed phase II study design.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At the suggestion of the FDA, we conducted two additional studies to provide further data about
ATHX-105&#146;s potential toxicological profile, one repeating a prior study under different conditions
and another study that we had not previously conducted and that is not typically included in
preclinical evaluation. While the first study confirmed our prior negative findings, meaning the
absence of a relevant toxicological effect, the second study produced data that suggests a rat
specific toxicological effect. We met with the FDA to discuss the issues and reached resolution
regarding all of the study design issues related to the partial clinical hold. However, based on
the results of the additional test and discussions with the FDA, we believe that the apparent
rodent specific effect could require additional non-clinical studies and greatly complicate
long-term toxicology testing and thereby increase substantially the development time, risks and
costs associated with subsequent development of ATHX-105. Furthermore, these increased risks of
development could make it substantially more difficult or impractical for us to establish an
attractive, third-party collaboration for the further development and commercialization of
ATHX-105.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Consequently, we have decided to suspend further development of ATHX-105 and withdraw our IND
application, and are currently focusing on the advancement of next generation compounds that
exhibit improved characteristics. While the potential significance of this toxicological effect to
humans remains unclear, it appears to be a compound-specific effect that is not representative of
the class of next generation compounds that we are continuing to develop while we explore potential
partnerships for the program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are also independently developing novel, orally-active pharmaceutical products for the treatment
of certain central nervous system disorders, including disorders such
as narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, and chronic fatigue associated with Parkinson&#146;s disease or other
conditions, as well as other potential indications such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
and other cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia. These programs are focused on the development
of potent, selective histamine H3 receptor antagonist compounds that act by elevating levels of
neurotransmitters in the sleep and cognitive centers of the brain and stimulating neurological
tone. This elevation results in an enhanced state of wakefulness and cognition, without causing
hyperactivity, excessive &#147;rebound&#148; sleepiness or addiction. The histamine H3 receptor antagonists being developed at Athersys represent a new class of drugs
that could have an improved efficacy and safety profile relative to existing drugs used for the
treatment of a range of conditions that affect cognitive ability, attention or wakefulness.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to our current product development programs, we developed our patented random
activation of gene expression, or RAGE, technology that provides us with the ability to produce
human cell lines that express specific, biologically well validated drug targets without relying
upon cloned and isolated gene sequences. While our RAGE technology is not a product, it is a
commercial technology that we have successfully applied for the benefit of our partners and that we
have also used for our own internal drug development programs. Modern drug screening approaches
typically require the physical isolation and structural modification of a gene of interest, an
approach referred to as gene cloning, in order to create a cell line that expresses a drug target
of interest. Researchers may then use the genetically modified cell line to identify pharmaceutical
compounds that inhibit or stimulate the target of interest. The RAGE technology enables us to turn
on or amplify the expression of a drug target without having to physically clone or isolate the
gene. In effect, the technology works through the random insertion of tiny, proprietary genetic
switches that randomly turn genes on without requiring their physical isolation, or any advance
knowledge of their structure. This technology provides us with broad freedom to work with targets
that may be otherwise unavailable as a result of intellectual property restrictions on the use of
specific cloned and isolated genes. Over the past several years, we have produced cell lines that
express drug targets in a range of disease areas such as metabolic disease, infectious disease,
oncology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and central nervous system disorders. Many of these
were produced for drug development programs at major pharmaceutical companies that we have
collaborated with, such as our ongoing collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, and some have been
produced for our internal drug development programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">By applying our proprietary cell therapy platform, MultiStem, we have established therapeutic
product development programs in the areas of cardiovascular disease, HSC transplant support and
ischemic stroke. We advanced our first two MultiStem programs into clinical development in 2008.
In addition, by applying our core technologies and capabilities, we have established drug
development programs in the areas of obesity, which was advanced through multiple phase I clinical

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing a proprietary nonembryonic stem cell product candidate, MultiStem, that we
believe has potential utility for treating a broad range of diseases and could have widespread
application in the field of clinical regenerative medicine. Potential applications of MultiStem
include the treatment of cardiovascular disease, cancer treatment related transplant support,
certain neurological conditions, autoimmune disease and other conditions. We initiated phase I
clinical trials in the areas of acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, and HSC transplant support in
2008 and received FDA authorization in late 2008 to initiate a phase I clinical trial in the area
of ischemic stroke. We believe that MultiStem represents a significant advancement in the field of
stem cell therapy and could have broad clinical application.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The therapeutic benefit of bone marrow transplantation has been recognized for decades, and its
clinical use has grown since Congress passed the National Organ Transplant Act in 1984 and the
National Marrow Donor Registry was established in 1990. However, widespread bone marrow or stem
cell transplantation has yet to become a reality. Some of the limitations that have prevented
broader clinical application of bone marrow or stem cell transplantation include the requirement
for tissue matching between donor and recipient, the inability to efficiently produce significant
quantities of stem cells, and a range of potential safety issues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A stem cell therapy that has the potential to address the challenges mentioned above could
represent a breakthrough in the field of regenerative medicine, since it could greatly expand the
clinical application of stem cell therapy or other forms of regenerative medicine. In 2003, we
acquired technology originally developed at the University of
Minnesota consisting of a rare and novel stem cell, the Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cell, or MAPC,
which may be isolated from adult bone marrow as well as other nonembryonic tissues. Over the past
several years, we have further developed this technology and the manufacturing of these cells for
use in ongoing clinical trials. In their potential product form, we refer to these cells as
MultiStem.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At each step of the MultiStem production process, cells are analyzed and qualified according to
pre-established criteria to ensure that a consistent, well characterized product candidate is
produced. Cells are harvested from a pre-qualified donor and then expanded to form a Master Cell
Bank from which we produce clinical grade material. In March&nbsp;2007, we and our manufacturing
partner, Lonza Walkersville, Inc., announced the successful establishment of a Master Cell Bank
produced under Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, and the production of clinical grade material
for our initial clinical trials. In multiple animal models, MultiStem has been shown to be
non-immunogenic, even when administered without the genetic matching that is typically required for
conventional bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">MultiStem allows us to pursue multiple high value commercial opportunities from a single product
platform, since we believe it has potential application in a range of disease states and
therapeutic areas. For example, based on numerous preclinical discussions with the FDA, we believe
that we will be able to apply data and information from certain preclinical safety studies to
support the development of MultiStem for treating multiple distinct diseases and in multiple
regulatory filings. As a result, we expect to be able to efficiently add clinical
indications as we further expand the scope of potential applications for MultiStem, enabling us to
reduce costs and shorten development timelines in comparison to traditional single-use preclinical
studies. From the fourth quarter of 2007 through 2008, we submitted and the FDA authorized, three INDs involving administration of MultiStem in phase I clinical trials in treating distinct disease conditions.

Stroke</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with independent investigators at a number of leading institutions, such as the University
of Minnesota, the Cleveland Clinic, the National Institutes of Health, the Medical College of
Georgia, the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center and the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, we
have studied MultiStem in a range of in vitro and animal models that reflect various types of human
disease or injury, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, brain damage due to restricted blood flow
in newborns, vascular disease, and bone marrow transplant support/GVHD. In addition, we are
exploring, or intend to explore, the potential application of MultiStem in the treatment of a range
of other conditions such as certain blood or immune deficiencies and various autoimmune diseases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As stated above, we have consistently observed that MultiStem is safe and effective in animal
models. As a result, we intend, subject to the availability of adequate resources, to advance
MultiStem in clinical development in three areas: treatment of damage caused by myocardial
infarction; support in the hematologic malignancy setting to reduce certain complications
associated with traditional bone marrow or HSC transplantation; and treatment for stroke caused by
a blockage of blood flow in the brain. We may expand to other clinical indication areas as results
warrant and resources permit.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In our current phase I clinical trial, we are exploring the use of MultiStem as a treatment for
damage caused by myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Myocardial infarction is one of the
leading causes of death and disability in the United States. Myocardial infarction is caused by the
blockage of one or more arteries that supply blood to the heart. Such blockages can be caused, for
example, by the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque deposit. According to the American Heart
Association 2007 Statistical Update, there were approximately 865,000 cases of myocardial
infarction that occurred in the United States in 2004 and approximately 7.9&nbsp;million individuals
living in the United States that had previously suffered a heart attack. In addition, there were
more than 452,000 deaths that occurred from various forms of ischemic heart disease, and 156,000
deaths due directly to myocardial infarction in 2004. A variety of risk factors are associated with
an elevated risk of myocardial infarction or atherosclerosis, including age, high blood pressure,
smoking, sedentary lifestyle and genetics. While advances in the diagnosis, prevention and
treatment of heart disease have had a positive impact, there is clearly room for improvement &#151;
myocardial infarction remains a leading cause of death and disability in the United States and the
rest of the world.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">MultiStem has been studied in validated animal models of AMI at both the Cleveland Clinic and the
University of Minnesota. Investigators demonstrated that the administration of allogeneic MultiStem
into the hearts of animals damaged by experimentally induced heart attacks resulted in significant
functional improvement in cardiac output and other functional parameters compared with animals that
received placebo or no treatment. Furthermore, the administration of immunosuppressive drug was not
required and provided no additional benefit in this study, and supports the concept of using
MultiStem as an allogeneic product.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with a qualified contract research organization, we completed additional preclinical
studies in established pig models of acute myocardial infarction using catheter delivery and
examining various factors such as the route and method of MultiStem administration, dose ranging,
and timing of treatment. In 2008, we initiated a multicenter phase I clinical trial in this
indication. We are working with leading cardiovascular treatment clinical sites and experts in the
area of cardiovascular disease to complete this phase I clinical trial.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing MultiStem for this indication in conjunction with our partner, Angiotech. We
entered into a product co-development collaboration with Angiotech in May&nbsp;2006, for the potential
application of MultiStem in multiple cardiovascular indications including myocardial infarction,
peripheral vascular disease and certain other indications.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Another area of focus is the use of MultiStem as adjunctive treatment for HSC/bone marrow
transplant used as therapy in hematologic malignancy. For many types of cancer, such as leukemia or
other blood-borne cancers, treatment typically involves radiation therapy or chemotherapy, alone or
in combination. Such treatment can substantially deplete the cells of the blood and immune system, by reducing the number of stem
cells in the bone marrow from which they arise. The more intense the radiation treatment or
chemotherapy, the more severe the resulting depletion is of the bone marrow, blood, and immune
system. Other tissues may also be affected, such as cells in the digestive tract and in the
pulmonary system. The result may be severe anemia, immunodeficiency, significant reduction in
digestive capacity, and other problems that may result in significant disability or death.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">One strategy for treating the depletion of bone marrow is to perform a peripheral blood stem cell
transplant or a bone marrow transplant. This approach may augment the patient&#146;s ability to form new
blood and immune cells and provide a significant survival advantage. However, finding a closely
matched donor is frequently difficult or even impossible. Even when such a donor is found, in many
cases there are immunological complications, such as GVHD, which may result in serious disability
or death.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with leading experts in the stem cell and bone marrow transplantation field, we have
studied MultiStem in animal models of radiation therapy and GVHD. In multiple animal models,
MultiStem has been shown to be non-immunogenic, even when administered without the genetic matching
that is typically required for conventional bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Furthermore,
in animal model systems testing immune reactivity of T-cells against unrelated donor tissue,
MultiStem has been shown to suppress the T-cell-mediated immune responses that are an important
factor in causing GVHD. MultiStem-treated animals also displayed a significant increase in survival
relative to controls. As a result, we believe that the administration of MultiStem in conjunction
with or following standard HSC transplantation may have the potential to reduce the incidence or
severity of complications and may enhance gastrointestinal function which is frequently compromised
as a result of radiation treatment or chemotherapy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2008, we initiated a phase I clinical trial to examine the safety and tolerability of MultiStem
in patients receiving a bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplant related to their
treatment for hematologic malignancy. The trial is an open label, multicenter trial that involves
leading experts in the field of bone marrow transplantation.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A third focus of our regenerative medicine program is the use of MultiStem for the treatment of
neurological injury as a result of ischemic stroke, which accounts for approximately 85% of all
strokes. Recent progress toward the development of safer and more effective treatments for ischemic
stroke has been disappointing. Despite the fact that ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes
of death and disability in the United States, affecting more than 700,000 new patients annually
according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, there has been
little progress toward the development of treatments that improve the prognosis for stroke victims.
The only FDA-approved drug currently available for ischemic stroke is the anti-clotting factor,
tPA, which must be administered to the patient within roughly three hours of the onset of the
stroke. Administration of tPA after this time frame is not recommended, since it can cause bleeding
or even death. Given this limited therapeutic window, it is estimated that less than 5% of ischemic
stroke victims currently receive treatment with tPA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In preclinical studies conducted by investigators at both the University of Minnesota and the
Medical College of Georgia, significant functional improvements have been observed in rodents that
have undergone an experimentally induced stroke, or that have incurred significant neurological
damage as a result of neonatal hypoxic ischemia, and then received treatment with MultiStem.
Through research conducted by collaborators at the Medical College of Georgia and presented at the
annual American Academy of Neurology meeting in April&nbsp;2006, we observed that administration of
MultiStem even one week after a surgically induced stroke results in substantial long-term
therapeutic benefit, as evidenced by the improvement of treated animals compared with controls in a
battery of tests examining mobility, strength, fine motor skills, and other aspects of neurological
functional improvement. These results have been confirmed in subsequent studies that demonstrate
MultiStem treatment is well tolerated, does not require immunosuppression, and results in a robust
and durable therapeutic benefit even when administered one week after the initial stroke event.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2008, we completed additional preclinical safety studies and submitted an IND for this
application, which was authorized by the FDA in December&nbsp;2008. The subsequent initiation of a
clinical trial will depend on the availability of capital resources to complete the study.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Obesity is a substantial contributing factor to a range of diseases that represent the major causes
of death and disability in the developed world today. Individuals that are clinically obese have
elevated rates of cardiovascular disease, stroke, certain types of cancer and diabetes. According
to the CDC, the incidence of obesity in the United States has increased at an epidemic rate during
the past 20&nbsp;years. CDC now estimates that 66% of all Americans are overweight, including more than
30% that are considered clinically obese. The percentage of young people who are overweight has
more than tripled since 1980. There has also been a dramatic rise in the rate of obesity in Europe
and Asia. Despite the magnitude of this problem, current approaches to clinical obesity are largely
ineffective, and we are aware of relatively few new therapeutic approaches in clinical development.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing novel pharmaceutical treatments for obesity. These compounds are designed to act
by stimulating a key receptor in the brain that regulates appetite and food intake &#151; the 5HT2c
receptor. The role of this receptor in regulating food intake is well understood in both animal
models and humans. In 1996, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals launched the anti-obesity drug Redux<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
(dexfenfluramine), a non-specific serotonin receptor agonist that was used with the stimulant
phentermine in a combination commonly known as fen-phen. This diet drug combination gained rapid
and widespread acceptance in the clinical marketplace and was shown to be highly effective at
regulating appetite, reducing food intake, and causing weight loss. Unfortunately, in addition to
stimulating the 5HT2c receptor, Redux also stimulated the 5HT2b receptor that is found in the
heart. The activation of 5HT2b by Redux is believed to have caused significant cardiovascular
problems in a number of patients and, as a result, Redux<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> was withdrawn from the market
in 1997. In 1996, doctors wrote 18&nbsp;million monthly prescriptions for drugs constituting the
fen/phen combination. In that same year, these drugs generated sales of greater than $400&nbsp;million,
serving as a benchmark for the substantial market opportunity for an effective drug to treat
clinical obesity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since the withdrawal of Redux from the market, several groups have published research that
implicates stimulation of the 5HT2b receptor as the underlying cause of the cardiovascular
problems. These findings suggest that highly selective compounds that stimulate the 5HT2c receptor,
but that do not appreciably stimulate the 5HT2b receptor, could be developed that maintain the
desired appetite suppressive effects without the cardiovascular toxicity. Recently, Arena
Pharmaceuticals developed a selective 5HT2c agonist, Lorcaserin, which exhibits significant
selectivity for the 5HT2c receptor relative to the 5HT2b receptor. In a phase II clinical trial
conducted by Arena Pharmaceuticals, Lorcaserin was demonstrated to reduce appetite and cause
statistically significant weight loss in patients that were administered the drug for a period of
three months, without causing any apparent cardiovascular effects. However, at higher doses the
drug has been shown to cause dizziness, nausea and headaches, which may be a consequence of its
apparently more limited selectivity for the 5HT2c receptor relative to another serotonin receptor
expressed in the brain, the 5HT2a receptor. Currently, Lorcaserin is undergoing a large scale,
two-year phase III clinical trial that is designed to evaluate safety, including cardiovascular
safety, and effectiveness at causing weight loss in patients that are administered Lorcaserin for a
period of one year. Lorcaserin is being administered twice per day at a dosage level that is half
the level previously observed to cause unacceptable levels of dizziness, nausea and headaches in
prior clinical studies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We initiated a drug development program focused on creating potent and selective compounds that
stimulate the 5HT2c receptor, but that avoid the 5HT2b receptor and other receptors, such as 5HT2a.
Our specific goal is to develop an orally administered pill that reduces appetite by stimulating
the 5HT2c receptor, but that does not stimulate the 5HT2b receptor, the 5HT2a receptor, or other
receptors that could cause adverse side effects. Based on extensive preclinical studies that we
have conducted with ATHX-105 and other compounds, we have demonstrated the ability to develop
highly potent and selective compounds. We believe that the potency and selectivity profile
displayed by compounds we develop for the 5HT2c receptor relative to both the 5HT2b receptor and
the 5HT2a receptor will result in better efficacy and a cleaner safety profile in clinical trials,
as well as a more convenient dosing schedule than other 5HT2C agonist programs.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have completed several clinical trials involving ATHX-105, a potent and selective 5HT2c receptor
agonist that was being developed for the treatment of obesity. In July&nbsp;2007, we initiated a phase
I clinical trial for ATHX-105 in the United Kingdom. The primary objective of the phase I clinical
trial was to assess the short-term safety of ATHX-105 and to establish an appropriate dose range
for subsequent clinical trials that will be conducted in order to assess safety and effectiveness.
The phase I clinical trial, which included 107 subjects, was completed in January&nbsp;2008, and top
line results were announced shortly after completion of the study.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The results of the study demonstrated that ATHX-105 was well-absorbed, resulting in good drug
exposures following oral administration, and was generally well tolerated up to a maximum tolerated
dose of 100 mg. There were no severe or serious adverse events observed in the clinical trial, no
negative effects on cardiovascular, hematology or other clinical parameters, and no
discontinuations due to adverse events. In addition to this study, we completed two phase I
clinical trials in the United Kingdom to further assess safety and tolerability of ATHX-105
administered at various dose levels, as well as examine regional absorption of the drug in the
gastrointestinal tract for the purpose of developing a formulated product.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Based upon the results of these and other studies, we applied to the FDA in the summer of 2008 to
initiate a double blind, placebo controlled phase II clinical trial involving administration of
ATHX-105 to patients in the United States. In September&nbsp;2008, following the FDA&#146;s review of our
investigational new drug application, or IND, the proposed trial was placed on partial clinical
hold pending the receipt of additional information and resolution of several issues relating to
ATHX-105&#146;s preclinical package and the proposed phase II study design.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At the suggestion of the FDA, we conducted two additional studies to provide further data about
ATHX-105&#146;s potential toxicological profile, one repeating a prior study under different conditions
and another study that we had not previously conducted and that is not typically included in
preclinical evaluation. While the first study confirmed our prior negative findings, meaning the
absence of a relevant toxicological effect, the second study produced data that suggests a rat
specific toxicological effect. We met with the FDA to discuss the issues and reached resolution
regarding all of the study design issues related to the partial clinical hold. However, based on
the results of the additional test and discussions with the FDA, we believe that the apparent
rodent specific effect could require additional non-clinical studies and greatly complicate
long-term toxicology testing and thereby increase substantially the development time, risks and
costs associated with subsequent development of ATHX-105. Furthermore, these increased risks of
development could make it substantially more difficult or impractical for us to establish an
attractive, third-party collaboration for the further development and commercialization of
ATHX-105.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Consequently, we have decided to suspend further development of ATHX-105 and withdraw our IND
application, and are currently focusing on the advancement of next generation compounds that
exhibit improved characteristics. While the potential significance of this toxicological effect to
humans remains unclear, it appears to be a compound-specific effect that is not representative of
the class of next generation compounds that we are continuing to develop while we explore potential
partnerships for the program.

Disorders</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to our other programs, we are developing pharmaceuticals that are designed to enhance
wakefulness and promote cognitive abilities in patients that experience attention or cognitive
deficits. Individuals that suffer from narcolepsy or other conditions that result in excessive
daytime sleepiness, or EDS, may experience persistent tiredness and lack of energy. Chronic fatigue
may be experienced by patients with other disease conditions such as Parkinson&#146;s or those
undergoing treatment for cancer. As a result, such individuals may experience significant
difficulty in performing certain tasks and may suffer an impaired quality of life. More than
100,000 individuals in the United States suffer from narcolepsy or EDS. Historically, narcoleptics
were treated with amphetamines and related stimulants that had substantial side-effects, but more
recently have been prescribed Provigil (Modafinil). This compound works by an unknown mechanism,
but appears to be relatively free of the stimulant side-effects of amphetamines. In addition to its
use for narcolepsy, Provigil is also approved for the treatment of shift work sleep disorder, or
SWSD, and sleep apnea. Known side effects experienced by patients taking Provigil include anxiety,
depression, rash, and rare occurrences of serious and potentially life threatening reactions
including Stevens Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, Erythema Multiforme, and
multi-organ hypersensitivity. Sales of Provigil in 2007 within the United States were reported to
be over $800&nbsp;million. Although Provigil appears to be an improvement over previous narcolepsy
drugs, certain safety concerns were raised by the FDA when Cephalon, Inc. attempted to gain
approval of modafinil for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, and the company
subsequently abandoned efforts in this market.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Individuals with attention or cognitive disorders may suffer from an inability to focus, solve
problems, process information, communicate, and may have memory impairment. Attention and cognitive
disorders include ADHD, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#146;s disease and other forms of dementia. Datamonitor
estimates that 23&nbsp;million children in the seven major pharmaceutical markets (United States,
France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and Japan) suffer from ADHD. Research also shows that
60% of children with ADHD maintain the disorder into adulthood. Despite the low rate of diagnosis,
ADHD drug revenues reached $2.5&nbsp;billion in 2004, 97% of which was generated within the United
States. Currently available treatments cause side effects and do not adequately address the
clinical need. Ritalin<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> (methylphenidate)&nbsp;is the most widely prescribed ADHD therapy. As
a stimulant with abuse potential, it has been classified as a controlled substance by the FDA and
the United States Drug Enforcement Agency. We believe there exists a significant market opportunity
for safer and more effective treatments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing multiple classes of highly selective and potent compounds designed to block the
H3 receptor and have established a program to develop non-stimulant, non-addictive, orally
administered drugs for the treatment of narcolepsy or other conditions related to excessive daytime
sleepiness. Our histamine H3 receptor antagonists represent a new class of drugs that could have an
improved efficacy and safety profile relative to existing drugs used for the treatment of
narcolepsy and related sleep disorders. The H3 receptor regulates levels of histamine and other
neurotransmitters in certain areas of the brain that play a direct role in regulating sleep and
cognitive function. In animal models, H3 receptor antagonists have been shown to increase histamine
release in the brain and improve wakefulness, attention and learning. In preclinical studies
conducted at independent labs, we have tested some of our more advanced compounds in well validated
rodent sleep models. During these studies, compounds significantly enhanced wakefulness without
causing hyperactivity. In comparison to modafinil or caffeine, certain compounds appeared far more
potent, achieving a comparable or better effect on wakefulness at substantially lower doses. In
addition, these compounds did not appear to cause the excessive rebound sleepiness that is a
characteristic of other agents used to promote wakefulness, such as amphetamines.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to our product development programs, we have developed RAGE, a patented technology that
provides us with the ability to produce human cell lines that express specific, biologically well
validated drug targets without relying upon cloned and isolated gene sequences. This technology
platform provides us with broad freedom to work with drug targets that may be inaccessible to most
other companies as a result of intellectual property restrictions on the use of specific cloned and
isolated genes. Over the past several years, we have produced cell lines that express drug targets
in a range of disease areas such as metabolic disease, infectious disease, oncology, cardiovascular
disease, inflammation and central nervous system disorders. Many of these were produced for drug
development programs at major pharmaceutical companies that we have collaborated with, and some
have been produced for our internal drug development programs.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2006, we established a collaboration with Angiotech that is focused on co-developing
MultiStem for the treatment of damage caused by myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular
disease. In support of the collaboration, Angiotech invested $10.0&nbsp;million in us and we may also
receive up to $3.75&nbsp;million of additional equity investments and $63.75&nbsp;million of aggregate cash
payments based upon the successful achievement of specified clinical development and
commercialization milestones, though there can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the terms of the collaboration, the parties are jointly funding clinical development
activities, whereby preclinical costs are borne solely by Athersys, costs for phase I and phase II
clinical trials are borne 50% by Athersys and 50% by Angiotech, costs for the first phase III
clinical trial will be borne 33% by Athersys and 67% by Angiotech, and costs for any phase III
clinical trials subsequent to the first phase III clinical trial will be borne 25% by Athersys and
75% by Angiotech. We have lead responsibility for preclinical and early clinical development and
manufacturing of the MultiStem product, and Angiotech will take the lead on pivotal and later
clinical trials and commercialization. We will receive nearly half of the net profits from the
sale of any jointly developed, approved products. In addition, we will retain the commercial rights
to MultiStem for all other therapeutic applications, including treatment of stroke, bone marrow
transplantation and oncology support, blood and immune system disorders, autoimmune disease, and
other indications that we may elect to pursue.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Bristol-Myers Squibb</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2000, we entered into a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to provide cell lines
expressing well validated drug targets produced using our RAGE technology for compound screening
and development. This initial collaboration was expanded in 2002 and again in 2006. Bristol-Myers
Squibb uses the cell lines in its internal drug development programs and, in exchange, we receive
license fee and milestone payments and will be entitled to receive royalties on the sale of any
approved products. Depending on the use of a cell line by Bristol-Myers Squibb and the progress of
drug development programs benefiting from the use of such a cell line, we may receive as much as
approximately $5.5&nbsp;million per cell line in additional license fees and milestone payments, though
we cannot assure you that any further milestones will be achieved or that we will receive any
additional milestone payments. Through December&nbsp;31, 2008, we have received an aggregate of
approximately $7.8&nbsp;million in license fees and milestone payments from Bristol-Myers Squibb, of
which $1.9&nbsp;million was earned in 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb successfully advanced into phase II clinical development a
drug candidate discovered using a target provided by us, thereby triggering a clinical development
milestone payment to us. Our collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which was
initially established in 2001, is now in its final phase. We intend to continue to prepare and
deliver validated drug targets for use by Bristol-Myers Squibb in its drug discovery efforts until
the collaboration objectives have been fulfilled. We will remain entitled to receive license fees
for targets delivered to Bristol-Myers Squibb, as well as milestone payments and royalties on
compounds developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb using our technology. During 2009, our revenues may
fluctuate compared to 2008 based on the timing of Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s demand for targets and the
timing of our work and based on the achievement and timing of Bristol-Myers Squibb milestone
achievements, if any. Beyond 2009, we anticipate that Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s demand for new
targets will be reduced.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration does not have a specific termination date, but will
terminate when Bristol-Myers Squibb no longer has an obligation to pay us royalties, which
obligation generally continues until the later of the expiration of the Bristol-Myers Squibb patent
covering an approved product and ten years after commercial sales of that product began. Though we
expect Bristol-Myers Squibb to file for and be issued patents for products developed under the
collaboration, we are not aware of any patents issued to Bristol-Myers Squibb covering any
potential products related to the collaboration. If either party breaches its material obligations
and fails to cure that breach within 60&nbsp;days after notice from the non-breaching party, the
non-breaching party may terminate the collaboration.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We face significant competition with respect to the various dimensions of our business. With regard
to our efforts to develop MultiStem as a novel stem cell therapy, currently, there are a number of
companies that are actively developing stem cell products, which encompass a range of different
cell types, including embryonic stem cells, umbilical cord stem cells, adult-derived stem cells,
and processed bone marrow derived cells.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Osiris is currently engaged in multiple phase II and phase III clinical trials involving Prochymal,
an allogeneic stem cell product based on mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs, that are obtained from
healthy consenting donors, and are administered without tissue matching. However, in contrast to
MultiStem, MSCs display limited expansion potential and more limited biological plasticity. In
November&nbsp;2008, Osiris announced a partnership in which Genzyme acquired development rights to
Prochymal for certain markets outside the United States and Canada in exchange for $130&nbsp;million in
license fees, up to $1.25&nbsp;billion in clinical and sales milestones, and royalties. Osiris
retains commercial development rights to Prochymal for the United States and Canada.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Other public companies are developing stem-related therapies, including Geron, Aastrom Biosciences,
Stem Cells Inc., Viacell, Celgene, Advanced Cell Technology, CRYO-CELL International, Mesoblast
Limited and Cytori Therapeutics. In addition, private companies, such as Cognate Therapeutics,
Gamida Cell, Arteriocyte, Plureon and others, are also developing cell therapy related products or
capabilities. Given the magnitude of the potential opportunity for stem cell therapy, we expect
competition in this area to intensify in the coming years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We also face competition in our efforts to develop compounds for the treatment of obesity. There
are already approved therapeutic products on the market, such as Xenical (also known as Alli),
which is marketed by Roche, and Meridia, which is marketed by Abbott Pharmaceuticals. However, both
of these drugs have reported side effects that we believe have limited their adoption by patients
and clinicians. For example, potential side effects associated with taking Xenical / Alli include
cramping, intestinal discomfort, flatulence, diarrhea, and leakage of oily stool. Potential side
effects associated with taking Meridia include increased blood pressure and heart rate, headache,
dry mouth, constipation, and insomnia. Individuals with high blood pressure, heart disease,
irregular heartbeat, or a history of stroke are also cautioned not to take Meridia.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">There are many other companies attempting to develop novel treatments for obesity, and a wide range
of approaches are being taken. Some of these companies include large, multinational pharmaceutical
companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Roche, Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly
and others. There are also a variety of biotechnology companies developing treatments for obesity,
including Arena Pharmaceuticals, Orexigen, Vivus, Neurosearch, Amgen, Regeneron, Nastech
Pharmaceutical Company, Alizyme, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Neurocrine Biosciences, Shionogi,
Metabolic Pharmaceuticals, Kyorin Pharmaceutical, and others. It is likely that, given the
magnitude of the market opportunity, many companies will continue to focus on the obesity area, and
that competition will remain high. If we are successful at developing a 5HT2c agonist as a safe and
effective treatment for obesity, it is likely that other companies will attempt to develop safer
and more effective compounds in the same class, or will attempt to combine therapies in an effort
to establish a safer and more effective therapeutic product.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Finally, we face competition with respect to our ability to produce drug targets for our drug
development programs. There are many companies with established intellectual property that seek to
restrict or protect the use of specific drug targets, including Incyte, Millennium Pharmaceuticals,
Human Genome Sciences, Lexicon Genetics, CuraGen, Exelixis, Myriad Genetics, Sangamo BioSciences,
and others.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe our most significant competitors are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more
established biotechnology companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, sales,
marketing, and human resources than we do. These companies may succeed in obtaining regulatory
approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, our
competitors may develop technologies and products that are cheaper, safer or more effective than
those being developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. Furthermore, some of
these companies may feel threatened by our activities and attempt to delay or impede our efforts to
develop our products or apply our technologies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Intellectual Property</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We rely on a combination of patent applications, patents, trademarks, and contractual provisions to
protect our proprietary rights. We believe that to have a competitive advantage, we must develop
and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. Currently, we require our officers,
employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored
researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their
employment, consulting, or advisory relationships with us, where appropriate. We also require our
employees, consultants, and advisors who we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and
assign to us all inventions conceived during the work day, developed using our property, or which
relate to our business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have a broad patent estate with claims directed to compositions, methods of production, and
methods of use of MAPCs and related technologies. We acquired ownership of part of our stem cell
technology and intellectual property as a result of our 2003 acquisition of a holding company,
which held the rights to the technology originally discovered at the University of Minnesota. We
also have an exclusive license to additional MAPC-related inventions (or in other words,
improvements) developed by the University of Minnesota and under a collaborative research
agreement with the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, or KUL, we have an exclusive license to
MAPC-related inventions developed at KUL using the MAPC technology or intellectual property or that
result from sponsored research funded by us. We also own and license additional intellectual

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have established a broad intellectual property portfolio related to our key functional genomics
technologies and product candidates. We have a broad patent estate with claims directed to
compositions, methods of making, and methods of using our small molecule drug candidates. In our
5HT2c program, we have filed four patent applications with broad claims directed to ATHX-105,
related compounds in the same chemical series from which ATHX-105 was derived, and back-up and
second generation compounds from distinct chemical series. In our Histamine H3 program, we have
filed four patent applications with broad claims directed to compounds from two distinct chemical
series. All compounds described in these patent applications were discovered at Athersys. In
addition, we currently have twelve issued United States patents and various issued international
patents relating to compositions and methods for the RAGE technology. These patents will expire in
2017. There are also several patent applications relating to human proteins and candidate drug
targets that we have identified through the application of RAGE and our other technologies. The
RAGE technology was developed by Dr.&nbsp;John Harrington and other Athersys scientists internally in
the mid-1990s.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that we have broad freedom to use and commercially develop our technologies and product
candidates. However, if successful, a patent infringement suit brought against us may force us or
any of our collaborators or licensees to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, or selling
potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party&#146;s intellectual property, unless that
party grants us rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we may be required to
obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others to continue to commercialize our
products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or
proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain
rights to the third party&#146;s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby
giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to
commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Any products we may develop and our research and development activities are subject to stringent
government regulation in the United States by the FDA and, in many instances, by corresponding
foreign and state regulatory agencies. The European Union, or EU, has vested centralized authority
in the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products to
standardize review and approval across EU member nations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">These regulatory agencies enforce comprehensive statutes, regulations, and guidelines governing the
drug development process. This process involves several steps. Initially, the company must generate
preclinical data to show safety before human testing may be initiated. In the United States, the
drug company must submit an IND to the FDA prior to securing authorization for human testing. The
IND must contain adequate data on product candidate chemistry, toxicology and metabolism and, where
appropriate, animal research testing to support initial safety.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A CTA is the European equivalent of the United States IND. CTA requirements are issued by the
Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the United Kingdom&#146;s health authority and were
enacted through the U.K. Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, which
implemented the EU Clinical Trials Directive in the United Kingdom.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Any of our product candidates will require regulatory approval and compliance with regulations made
by United
States and foreign government agencies prior to commercialization in such countries. The process of
obtaining FDA or foreign regulatory agency approval has historically been extremely costly and time
consuming. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety,
efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and
distribution of biologics and new drugs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Preclinical studies can take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based
on those studies will become effective to permit clinical trials to begin. Once clinical trials are
initiated, they generally take five to seven years, or longer, to complete. After completion of
clinical trials of a new drug or biologic product, FDA approval of the NDA or BLA must be obtained.
This process requires substantial time and effort and there is no assurance that the FDA will
accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that the FDA will grant approval. In the past,
the FDA&#146;s approval of an NDA or BLA has taken, on average, one to two years, but in some instances
may take substantially longer. If questions regarding safety or efficacy arise, additional studies
may be required, followed by a resubmission of the NDA or BLA. Review and approval of an NDA or BLA
can take up to several years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each drug manufacturing facility must be
inspected and approved by the FDA. All manufacturing establishments are subject to inspections by
the FDA and by other federal, state, and local agencies, and must comply with GMP requirements. We
do not currently have any GMP manufacturing capabilities, and will rely on contract manufacturers
to produce material for any clinical trials that we may conduct.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We must also obtain regulatory approval in other countries in which we intend to market any drug.
The requirements governing conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and
reimbursement vary widely from country to country. FDA approval does not ensure regulatory approval
in other countries. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent
in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In some countries, the sale price
of the drug must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is
granted. Even if a foreign regulatory authority approves a drug product, it may not approve
satisfactory prices for the product.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to regulation under the
Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control
Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other present and potential future federal,
state, or local regulations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous
materials, chemicals, biological materials, and various radioactive compounds. Although we believe
that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials currently comply in all
material respects with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of
accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the
event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such
liability could exceed our available resources.

in other SEC filings, describe risks that could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our equity securities could
decline. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to
us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Risks Related To Our Business and Our Industry</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Athersys has incurred losses since inception and we expect to incur significant net losses in the
foreseeable future and may never become profitable.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since Athersys&#146; inception in 1995, it has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from
operations. Athersys has incurred net losses of $11&nbsp;million in 2006, $19&nbsp;million in 2007 and
$18&nbsp;million in 2008. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had an accumulated deficit of $178&nbsp;million, and
anticipate incurring additional losses for at least the next several years. We expect to spend
significant resources over the next several years to enhance our technologies and to fund research
and development of our pipeline of potential products. To date, substantially all of Athersys&#146;
revenue has been derived from corporate collaborations, license agreements and government grants.
In order to achieve profitability, we must develop products and technologies that can be
commercialized by us or through future collaborations. Our ability to generate revenues and become
profitable will depend on our ability, alone or with potential collaborators, to timely,
efficiently and successfully complete the development of our product candidates. We have never
earned revenue from selling a product and we may never do so, as none of our product candidates
have been approved for sale, since they are currently being tested yet in humans and animal
studies. We cannot assure you that we will ever earn revenue or that we will ever become
profitable. If we sustain losses over an extended period of time, we may be unable to continue our
business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We will need substantial additional funding to develop our products and for our future operations.
If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to do so, we may be required to delay, scale back or
eliminate our product development activities or may be unable to continue our business.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The development of our product candidates will require a commitment of substantial funds to conduct
the costly and time-consuming research, which may include preclinical and clinical testing,
necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and bring our products to market. Net cash used in
Athersys&#146; operations was $8&nbsp;million in 2006,
$12&nbsp;million in 2007 and $16&nbsp;million in 2008. Based on
current plans, we anticipate using $11&nbsp;million to $13&nbsp;million of our cash (net of cash inflows) to
fund our activities in 2009, which includes clinical trial costs to advance our MultiStem programs
and reflects a reduction in costs from 2008 as a result of the suspension of the ATHX-105 clinical
program early in 2009. We expect to have available cash to fund our operations through 2011 based
on our current business and operational plans and assuming no new financings. Our future capital
requirements will depend on many factors, including:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We cannot assure you that we will not need additional capital sooner than currently anticipated. We
will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our future operations. We cannot be
certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all, particularly in
light of the current credit crisis. In recent years, it has been difficult for companies to raise
capital due to a variety of factors, which may or may not continue. To the extent we raise
additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the ownership position of our existing
stockholders could be substantially diluted. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of
preferred stock or debt securities, these securities are likely to have rights, preferences and
privileges senior to our common stock. Fluctuating interest rates could also increase the costs of
any debt financing we may obtain.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Success in preclinical studies or completed clinical trials does not ensure that later studies or
trials, including continuing non-clinical studies and large-scale clinical trials, will be
successful nor does it necessarily predict future results. The rate of failure in drug development
is quite high, and many companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered
significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials.
Product candidates may fail to show desired safety and efficacy in larger and more diverse patient
populations in later stage clinical trials, despite having progressed through early stage trials.
Negative or inconclusive results from any of our ongoing preclinical studies or clinical trials
could result in delays, modifications, or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials and the
termination of our development of a product candidate. Additionally, even if we are able to
successfully complete pivotal phase III clinical trials, the FDA still may not approve our product
candidates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Our product canditates are in an early stage of development and we currently have no therapeutic
products approved for sale. If we are unable to develop, obtain regulatory approval or market any

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are in the early stage of product development, and we are dependent on the application of our
technologies to discover or develop therapeutic product candidates. We currently do not sell any
approved therapeutic products and do not expect to have any products commercially available for
several years, if at all. You must evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities
affecting an early stage biotechnology company. Our product candidates require additional research
and development, preclinical testing, clinical testing and regulatory review and/or approvals or
clearances before marketing. To date, no one to our knowledge has commercialized any therapeutic
products using our technologies and we might never commercialize any product using our technologies
and strategy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, we may not succeed in developing new product candidates as an alternative to our
existing portfolio of product candidates. If our current product candidates are delayed or fail, or
we fail to successfully develop and commercialize new product candidates, our financial condition
may be negatively affected, and we may have to curtail or cease our operations.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A key element of our business strategy is to commercialize some of our product candidates through
collaborations with other companies. Our strategy includes establishing collaborations and
licensing agreements with one or more pharmaceutical, biotechnology or device companies, preferably
after we have advanced product candidates through the initial stages of clinical development.
However, we may not be able to establish or maintain such licensing and collaboration arrangements
necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Even if we are able to maintain or
establish licensing or collaboration arrangements, these arrangements may not be on favorable terms
and may contain provisions that will restrict our ability to develop, test and market our product
candidates. Any failure to maintain or establish licensing or collaboration arrangements on
favorable terms could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition or ability to
develop and commercialize our product candidates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our agreements with our collaborators and licensees may have provisions that give rise to disputes
regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. These and other possible disagreements could
lead to termination of the agreement or delays in collaborative research, development, supply, or
commercialization of certain product candidates, or could require or result in litigation or
arbitration. Moreover, disagreements could arise with our collaborators over rights to intellectual
property or our rights to share in any of the future revenues of products developed by our
collaborators. These kinds of disagreements could result in costly and time-consuming litigation.
Any such conflicts with our collaborators could reduce our ability to obtain future collaboration
agreements and could have a negative impact on our relationship with existing collaborators.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Currently, our material collaborations and licensing arrangements are our product co-development
collaboration with Angiotech to jointly develop and ultimately market MultiStem for the treatment
of damage caused by myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease, our collaboration
agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb pursuant to which we provide cell lines produced using our RAGE
technology, and our license with the University of Minnesota pursuant to which we license certain
aspects of the MultiStem technology. These arrangements do not have specific termination dates;
rather, each arrangement terminates upon the occurrence of certain events.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Angiotech collaboration terminates upon the earliest to occur of (a)&nbsp;if at least one cell
therapy product has obtained regulatory approval and we and Angiotech have shared profits with
respect to sales of at least one cell therapy product, the date that there has been no sales for
12&nbsp;months of any cell therapy product that has been the subject of profit-sharing, unless a
clinical development candidate is in at least a phase III clinical trial or later, or (b)&nbsp;the later
of (1)&nbsp;the expiration date of the last-to-expire patent licensed to Angiotech or (2)&nbsp;the 15-year
anniversary. Neither we nor Angiotech may terminate the collaboration at will, but either party may
elect at certain points to not move forward with individual product development programs. However,
Angiotech has the right to terminate the collaboration if, among other things, Angiotech, in its
reasonable judgment, determines that a primary endpoint in a clinical trial within a clinical
development plan has not been fulfilled or met, or if the clinical efficacy and/or safety with
respect to cells, or a clinical development candidate or a cell therapy product have not been
demonstrated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration terminates when Bristol-Myers Squibb no longer has an
obligation to pay us royalties, which obligation generally continues until the later of the
expiration of the Bristol-Myers Squibb patent covering a product utilizing our cell line or ten
years after commercial sales of that product began.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The University of Minnesota license agreement terminates when the last patent licensed to us
expires. We may terminate the license agreement at any time. The University of Minnesota may
terminate the license if we fail to pay royalties when due or fail to perform the material terms of
the license, such as our obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the
MultiStem technology.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our success depends on the performance by our collaborators of their responsibilities under our
collaboration arrangements. Some potential collaborators may not perform their obligations in a
timely fashion or in a manner satisfactory to us. Typically, we cannot control the amount of
resources or time our collaborators may devote to our programs or potential products that may be
developed in collaboration with us. We are currently involved in multiple research and development
collaborations with academic and research institutions. These collaborators frequently depend on
outside sources of funding to conduct or complete research and development, such as grants or other
awards. In addition, our academic collaborators may depend on graduate students, medical students,
or research assistants to conduct certain work, and such individuals may not be fully trained or
experienced in certain areas, or they may elect to discontinue their participation in a particular
research program, creating an inability to complete ongoing research in a timely and efficient
manner. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to control the precise timing and
execution of any experiments that may be conducted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Additionally, our current or future corporate collaborators will retain the ability to pursue other
research, product development or commercial opportunities that may be directly competitive with our
programs. If these collaborators elect to prioritize or pursue other programs in lieu of ours, we
may not be able to advance product development programs in an efficient or effective manner, if at
all. If a collaborator is pursuing a competitive program and
encounters unexpected financial or capability limitations, they may be motivated to reduce the
priority placed on our programs or delay certain activities related to our programs or be unwilling
to properly fund their share of the development expenses for our programs. Any of these
developments could harm our product and technology development efforts, which could seriously harm
our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We intend to seek approval for our product candidates through the FDA approval process. To obtain
regulatory
approvals, we must, among other requirements, complete clinical trials showing that our products
are safe and effective for a particular indication. Under the approval process, we must submit
clinical and non-clinical data to demonstrate the medication is safe and effective. For example, we
must be able to provide data and information, which may include extended pharmacology, toxicology,
reproductive toxicology, bioavailability and genotoxicity studies to establish suitability for
phase II or large scale phase III clinical trials.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of our product candidates are at an early stage of development. As these programs enter and
progress through early stage clinical development, or complete additional non-clinical testing, an
indication of a lack of safety or lack of efficacy may result in the early termination of an
ongoing trial, or may cause us or any of our collaborators to forego further development of a
particular product candidate or program. The FDA or other regulatory agencies may require extensive
clinical trials or other testing prior to granting approval, which could be costly and time
consuming to conduct. Any of these developments would hinder, and potentially prohibit, our ability
to commercialize our product candidates. We cannot assure you that clinical trials will in fact
demonstrate that our products are safe or effective.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Additionally, we may not be able to find acceptable patients or may experience delays in enrolling
patients for our currently planned or any future clinical trials. The FDA or we may suspend our
clinical trials at any time if either believes that we are exposing the subjects participating in
the trials to unacceptable health risks. The FDA or institutional review boards and/or
institutional biosafety committees at the medical institutions and healthcare facilities where we
seek to sponsor clinical trials may not permit a trial to proceed or may suspend any trial
indefinitely if they find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Product development costs to us and our potential collaborators will increase if we have delays in
testing or approvals or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned. We
expect to continue to rely on third party clinical investigators at medical institutions and
healthcare facilities to conduct our clinical trials, and, as a result, we may face additional
delaying factors outside our control. Significant delays may adversely affect our financial results

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Many factors, known and unknown, can adversely affect clinical trials and the ability to evaluate a
product&#146;s efficacy. During the course of treatment, patients can die or suffer other adverse events
for reasons that may or may not be related to the proposed product being tested. Even if unrelated
to our product, certain events can nevertheless adversely impact our clinical trials. As a result,
our ability to ultimately develop and market the products and obtain revenues would suffer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Even promising results in preclinical studies and initial clinical trials do not ensure successful
results in later clinical trials, which test broader human use of our products. Many companies in
our industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, despite promising
results in earlier trials. Even successful clinical trials may not result in a marketable product
or be indicative of the efficacy or safety of a product. Many factors or variables could affect the
results of clinical trials and cause them to appear more promising than they may otherwise be.
Product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials could ultimately be found to be
unsafe or ineffective.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">If we are successful at obtaining regulatory approval for MultiStem or any of our other product
candidates, regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries where a product will be
sold may require extensive additional clinical trials or post-approval clinical studies that are
expensive and time consuming to conduct. In particular, therapeutic products administered for the
treatment of persistent or chronic conditions, such as obesity, are likely to require extensive
follow-up studies and close monitoring of patients after regulatory approval has been granted, for
any signs of adverse effects that occur over a long period of time. These studies may be expensive
and time consuming to conduct and may reveal side effects or other harmful effects in patients that
use our therapeutic products after they are on the market, which may result in the limitation or
withdrawal of our drugs from the market. Alternatively, we may not be able to conduct such
additional trials, which might force us to abandon our efforts to develop or commercialize certain
product candidates. Even if post-approval studies are not requested or required, after our products
are approved and on the market, there might be safety issues that emerge over time that require a
change in product labeling or that require withdrawal of the product from the market, which would
cause our revenue to decline.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Additionally, any products that we may successfully develop will be subject to ongoing regulatory
requirements after they are approved. These requirements will govern the manufacturing, packaging,
marketing, distribution, and use of our products. If we fail to comply with such regulatory
requirements, approval for our products may be withdrawn, and product sales may be suspended. We
may not be able to regain compliance, or we may only be able to regain compliance after a lengthy

established by the FDA, or similar regulations in other countries. Our pharmaceutical product
candidates or MultiStem product candidate may be in competition with other products or companies
for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if third parties give
other products greater priority than our product candidates. These third parties may not deliver
sufficient quantities of our pharmaceutical or MultiStem product candidates, manufacture our

produce our pharmaceutical product candidates or MultiStem product on acceptable terms, or on a
timely and cost-effective basis. We cannot assure you that manufacturers on whom we will depend
will be able to successfully produce our pharmaceutical product candidates or MultiStem product on
acceptable terms, or on a timely or cost-effective basis. We cannot assure you that manufacturers
will be able to manufacture our products in accordance with our product specifications or will meet
FDA or other requirements. We must have sufficient and acceptable quantities of our product
materials to conduct our clinical trials and to market our product candidates, if and when such
products have been approved by the FDA for marketing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient and
acceptable quantities of our product material, we may be required to delay the clinical testing and
marketing of our products.

manufacturing capabilities, it could be difficult and very expensive to change suppliers. Any
change in the location of
manufacturing would require FDA inspection and approval, which could interrupt the supply of
products and may be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. If we are unable to identify
alternative contract manufacturers that are qualified to produce our products, we may have to
temporarily suspend the production of products, and would be unable to generate revenue from the
sale of products.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our failure or the failure of our potential collaborators or third party manufacturers to comply
with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements including manufacturing, quality control,
labeling, safety surveillance, promoting and reporting may result in criminal prosecution, civil
penalties, recall or seizure of our products, total or partial suspension of production or an
injunction, as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us. Discovery of
previously unknown problems with a product, supplier, manufacturer or facility may result in
restrictions on the sale of our products, including a withdrawal of such products from the market.
The occurrence of any of these events would negatively impact our business and results of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. Therefore, to commercialize our
product candidates, if and when such products have been approved and are ready for marketing, we
expect to collaborate with third parties to perform these functions. We will either need to share
the value generated from the sale of any products and/or pay a fee to the contract sales
organization. If we establish any such relationships, we will be dependent upon the capabilities of
our collaborators or contract service providers to effectively market, sell, and distribute our
product. If they are ineffective at selling and distributing our product, or if they choose to
emphasize other products over ours, we may not achieve the level of product sales revenues that we
would like. If conflicts arise, we may not be able to resolve them easily or effectively, and we
may suffer financially as a result. If we cannot rely on the sales, marketing and distribution
capabilities of our collaborators or of contract service providers, we may be forced to establish
our own capabilities. We have no experience in developing, training or managing a sales force and
will incur substantial additional expenses if we decide to market any of our future products
directly. Developing a marketing and sales force is also time consuming and could delay launch of
our future products. In addition, we will compete with many companies that currently have extensive
and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Our marketing and sales efforts may be unable to
compete successfully against these companies.

extensive technical, scientific and financial expertise and management and operational experience,
these individuals would be difficult to replace. Consequently, the loss of services of one or more
of these individuals could result in product development delays or the failure of our

protects our technologies and our pharmaceutical products. Patent positions may be highly uncertain
and may involve complex legal and factual questions, including the ability to establish
patentability of compounds and methods for using them for which we seek patent protection. We
cannot predict the breadth of claims that will ultimately be allowed in our patent applications, if
any, including those we have in-licensed or the extent to which we may enforce these claims against
our competitors. We have filed multiple patent applications that seek to protect the composition of
matter and method of use related to our small molecule programs. In addition, we are prosecuting
more than 25 distinct patent applications directed to composition, methods of production, and
methods of use of MultiStem and related technologies. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining these

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, patent law outside the United States is uncertain and in many countries intellectual
property laws are undergoing review and revision. The laws of some countries do not protect
intellectual property rights to the same extent as domestic laws. It may be necessary or useful for
us to participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our competitors&#146; patents
or to defend the validity of any of our or our licensor&#146;s future patents, which could result in
substantial costs and would divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.
With respect to certain of our inventions, we have decided not to pursue patent protection outside
the United States, both because we do not believe it is cost effective and because of
confidentiality concerns. Accordingly, our international competitors could develop and receive
foreign patent protection for gene sequences and functions for which we are seeking United
States patent protection, enabling them to sell products that we have developed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Technologies licensed to us by others, or in-licensed technologies, are important to our business.
The scope of our rights under our licenses may be subject to dispute by our licensors or third
parties. Our rights to use these technologies and to practice the inventions claimed in the
licensed patents are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not
terminating them. In particular, we depend on certain technologies relating to our MultiStem
technology licensed from the University of Minnesota. As a result of this license, we have agreed
to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize this technology. If we fail to
comply with those obligations, we may lose some of the rights that enable us to utilize this
technology, and our ability to develop products based on MultiStem could be seriously hampered.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, we may in the future acquire rights to additional technologies by licensing such
rights from existing licensors or from third parties. Such in-licenses may be costly. Also, we
generally do not control the patent prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of in-licensed
technologies. Accordingly, we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this
intellectual property as we do over our internally developed technologies. Moreover, some of our
academic institution licensors, collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data
and information to which we have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our
technologies and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations, our ability
to protect our proprietary information or obtain patent protection in the future may be impaired,

information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our
technology. To protect our trade secrets, we may enter into confidentiality agreements with
employees, consultants and potential collaborators. However, these agreements may not provide
meaningful protection of our trade secrets or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or
disclosure of such information. Likewise, our trade secrets or know-how may become known through

areas of adult derived stem cells. In particular, other companies and academic institutions have
announced that they have identified nonembryonic stem cells isolated from bone marrow or other
tissues that have the ability to form a range of cell types, or display the property of
pluripotency. To the extent any of these companies or academic institutions currently have, or
obtain in the future, broad patent claims, such patents could block our ability to use various
aspects of our discovery and development process and might prevent us from developing or
commercializing newly discovered applications of our MultiStem technology, or otherwise conducting
our business. In addition, it is possible that some of the pharmaceutical product candidates we are
developing may not be patentable or may be covered by intellectual property of third parties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are not currently a party to any litigation, interference, opposition, protest, reexamination or
any other potentially adverse governmental, ex parte or inter-party proceeding with regard to our
patent or trademark positions. However, the life sciences and other technology industries are
characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
Many life sciences and other technology companies have employed intellectual property litigation as
a way to gain a competitive advantage. If we become involved in litigation, interference
proceedings, oppositions, reexamination, protest or other potentially adverse intellectual property
proceedings as a result of alleged infringement by us of the rights of others or as a result of
priority of invention disputes with third parties, we might have to spend significant amounts of
money, time and effort defending our position and we may not be successful. In addition, any claims
relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights or proprietary determinations, even
if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert
management&#146;s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements
that are not advantageous to us. If we do not have the financial resources to support such
litigation or appeals, we may forfeit or lose certain commercial rights. Even if we have the
financial resources to continue such litigation or appeals, we may lose. In the event that we lose,
we may be forced to pay very substantial damages; we may have to obtain costly license rights,
which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all; or we may be prohibited from
selling products that are found to infringe the patent rights of others.

favorable. Even if successful on priority grounds, an interference action may result in loss of
claims based on patentability grounds raised in the interference action. Litigation, interference
proceedings or other proceedings could divert management&#146;s time and efforts. Even unsuccessful
claims could result in significant legal fees and other expenses, diversion of management&#146;s time

to negotiate licenses to disputed rights from third parties. Although patent and intellectual
property disputes in the technology area are often settled through licensing or similar
arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include license

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Foreign governments often impose strict price controls on approved products, which may adversely
affect our future profitability in those countries, and the re-importation of drugs to the United

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Frequently foreign governments impose strict price controls on newly approved therapeutic products.
If we obtain regulatory approval to sell products in foreign countries, we may be unable to obtain
a price that provides an adequate financial return on our investment. Furthermore, legislation in
the United States may permit re-importation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States,
including re-importation from foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in
the United States due to foreign government-mandated price controls. Such a practice, especially if
it is conducted on a widespread basis, may significantly reduce our potential United
States revenues from any drugs that we are able to develop.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>If we elect not to sell our products in foreign countries that impose government mandated price
controls because we decide it is uneconomical to do so, a foreign government or patent office may
attempt to terminate our intellectual property rights in that country, enabling competitors to make
and sell our products.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In some cases we may choose not to sell a product in a foreign country because it is uneconomical
to do so under a system of government-imposed price controls, or because it could severely limit
our profitability in the United States or other markets. In such cases, a foreign government or
patent office may terminate any intellectual property rights we may obtain with respect to that
product. Such a termination could enable competitors to produce and sell our product in that
market. Furthermore, such products may be exported into the United States through legislation that
authorizes the importation of drugs from outside the United States. In such an event, we may have
to reduce our prices, or we may be unable to compete with low-cost providers of our drugs, and we
could be financially harmed as a result.

a dramatic increase in activity in technology programs, genomics programs, collaborative research
programs, discovery programs, and scope of operations. At other times, we have had to reduce staff
in order to bring our expenses in line with our financial resources. Our success will also depend
on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to improve our operational
capabilities and our management information and financial control systems, and to expand, train and
manage our work force.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We may be sued for product liability, which could adversely affect our business.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because our business strategy involves the development and sale by either us or our collaborators
of commercial products, we may be sued for product liability. We may be held liable if any product
we develop and commercialize, or any product our collaborators commercialize that incorporates any
of our technology, causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing,
manufacturing, marketing, sale or consumer use. In addition, the safety studies we must perform and
the regulatory approvals required to commercialize our pharmaceutical products, will not protect us
from any such liability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We carry product liability insurance, as well as liability insurance for conducting clinical
trials. Currently, we carry a $5&nbsp;million per event, $5&nbsp;million annual aggregate coverage for both
our products liability policy and our clinical trials protection. We also intend to seek product
liability insurance for any approved products that we may develop or acquire. However, in the event
there are product liability claims against us, our insurance may be insufficient to cover the
expense of defending against such claims, or may be insufficient to pay or settle such claims.
Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain adequate product liability insurance coverage for
commercial sales of any of our approved products. If such insurance is insufficient to protect us,
our results of operations will suffer. If any product liability claim is made against us, our
reputation and future sales will be damaged, even if we have adequate insurance coverage.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>The availability, manner, and amount of reimbursement for our product candidates from government
and private payers are uncertain, and our inability to obtain adequate reimbursement for any
products could severely limit our product sales.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We expect that many of the patients who seek treatment with any of our products that are approved
for marketing will be eligible for Medicare benefits. Other patients may be covered by private
health plans. If we are unable to obtain or retain adequate levels of reimbursement from Medicare
or from private health plans, our ability to sell our products will be severely limited. The
application of existing Medicare regulations and interpretive coverage and payment determinations
to newly approved products is uncertain and those regulations and interpretive determinations are
subject to change. The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act, enacted in
December&nbsp;2003, provides for a change in reimbursement methodology that reduces the Medicare
reimbursement rates for many drugs, which may adversely affect reimbursement for any products we
may develop. Medicare regulations and interpretive determinations also may determine who may be
reimbursed for certain services, and may limit the pool of patients our product candidates are
being developed to serve.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Federal, state and foreign governments continue to propose legislation designed to contain or
reduce health care costs. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of products like our
potential products may change further or be adopted before any of our potential products are
approved for marketing. Cost control initiatives by governments or third-party payers could
decrease the price that we receive for any one or all of our potential products or increase patient
coinsurance to a level that make our products under development become unaffordable. In addition,
government and private health plans persistently challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of
therapeutic products. Accordingly, these third parties may ultimately not consider any or all of
our products under development to be cost effective, which could result in products not being
covered under their health plans or covered only at a lower price. Any of these initiatives or
developments could prevent us from successfully marketing and selling any of our products that are
approved for commercialization.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Public perception of ethical and social issues surrounding the use of adult-derived stem cell
technology may limit or discourage the use of our technologies, which may reduce the demand for our
therapeutic products and technologies and reduce our revenues.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our success will depend in part upon our ability to develop therapeutic products incorporating or
discovered through our adult-derived stem cell technology. For social, ethical, or other reasons,
governmental authorities in the United States and other countries may call for limits on, or
regulation of the use of, adult-derived stem cell technologies. Although we do not use the more
controversial stem cells derived from embryos or fetuses, claims that adult-derived stem cell
technologies are ineffective, unethical or pose a danger to the environment may influence public
attitudes. The subject of stem cell technologies in general has received negative publicity and
aroused public debate in the United States and some other countries. Ethical and other concerns
about our adult-derived stem cell technology could materially hurt the market acceptance of our
therapeutic products and technologies, resulting in diminished sales and use of any products we are
able to develop using adult-derived stem cells.

nominal assets. BTHC VI&#146;s common stock was eligible for trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, although
no trading took place prior to the merger because none of BTHC VI&#146;s then-outstanding shares were
able to be transferred under the terms of BTHC VI&#146;s bankruptcy plan until the merger was
consummated. From June&nbsp;8, 2007 to December&nbsp;11, 2007, our common stock was quoted on the OTC
Bulletin Board under the symbol &#147;AHYS&#148; at the following prices:

dividends and other payments from ABT Holding Company to generate the funds necessary to make
dividend payments, if any, on our common stock. ABT Holding Company, however, is legally distinct
from us and has no obligation to pay amounts to us. The ability of ABT Holding Company to make
dividend and other payments to us is subject to, among other things, the availability of funds, the
terms of our indebtedness and applicable state laws. We did not pay cash dividends on our common
stock during the past two years. We do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends on our common
stock in the foreseeable future. Rather, we anticipate that we will retain earnings, if any, for
use in the development of our business.

OPERATIONS</B></U></div>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with &#147;Item&nbsp;8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; included below in this annual report on Form&nbsp;10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Overview and Recent Developments</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic product
candidates designed to extend and enhance the quality of human life. Through the application of our
proprietary technologies, we have established a pipeline of therapeutic product development
programs in multiple disease areas. Our current product development portfolio consists of
MultiStem, a patented and proprietary stem cell product that we are developing as a treatment for
multiple disease indications, and that is currently being evaluated in two ongoing clinical trials.
In addition, we are developing novel pharmaceuticals to treat indications such as obesity, certain
cognitive and attention disorders, as well as narcolepsy, other forms of excessive daytime
sleepiness and chronic fatigue associated with certain disease indications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Current Programs</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2008, we advanced two MultiStem programs into clinical development, initiating phase I studies in cardiovascular disease (treating patients that have suffered an acute myocardial
infarction) and in oncology treatment support (administering MultiStem to leukemia or lymphoma
patients who are receiving a traditional bone marrow or HSC transplant to reduce the risk or
severity of GVHD). We are conducting the acute myocardial infarction clinical trial with our
partner Angiotech. In May&nbsp;2006, we entered into a product co-development collaboration with
Angiotech to jointly develop and ultimately market MultiStem for the treatment of damage caused by
myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease. We retain the exclusive commercial rights
to the development of MultiStem for other indication areas, including oncology treatment support,
neurological indications, autoimmune disease, and other areas.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2008, Angiotech announced certain reorganization initiatives to reduce its costs,
citing the potential need for an amendment and reduction in cash outlays related to our
collaboration on a list of possible actions. At this time, no such amendment or reduction has been
requested or made to our collaboration, and Angiotech continues to fund its share of phase I costs
on a timely basis. In the event that Angiotech fails to fund its obligations under the terms of
our contract, our net costs for the phase I clinical trial would increase or the clinical trial may
be curtailed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We applied to the FDA in the summer of 2008 to
initiate a double blind, placebo controlled phase II clinical trial involving administration of
ATHX-105 to patients in the United States. In September&nbsp;2008, following the FDA&#146;s review of our
investigational new drug application, or IND, the proposed trial was placed on partial clinical
hold pending the receipt of additional information and resolution of several issues relating to
ATHX-105&#146;s preclinical package and the proposed phase II study design.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At the suggestion of the FDA, we conducted two additional studies to provide further data about
ATHX-105&#146;s potential toxicological profile, one repeating a prior study under different conditions
and another study that we had not previously conducted and that is not typically included in
preclinical evaluation. While the first study confirmed our prior negative findings, meaning the
absence of a relevant toxicological effect, the second study produced data that suggests a rat
specific toxicological effect. We met with the FDA to discuss the issues and reached resolution
regarding all of the study design issues related to the partial clinical hold. However, based on
the results of the additional test and discussions with the FDA, we believe that the apparent
rodent specific effect could require additional non-clinical studies and greatly complicate
long-term toxicology testing and thereby increase substantially the development time, risks and
costs associated with subsequent development of ATHX-105. Furthermore, these increased risks of
development could make it substantially more difficult or impractical for us to establish an
attractive, third-party collaboration for the further development and commercialization of
ATHX-105.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Consequently, we have decided to suspend further development of ATHX-105 and withdraw our IND
application, and are currently focusing on the advancement of next generation compounds that
exhibit improved characteristics. While the potential significance of this toxicological effect to
humans remains unclear, it appears to be a compound-specific effect that is not representative of
the class of next generation compounds that we are continuing to develop while we explore potential
partnerships for the program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are also independently developing novel orally active pharmaceutical products for the treatment
of certain central nervous system disorders, including disorders such
as narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, and chronic fatigue, as well as other potential indications such as attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder and other cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Financial</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In June&nbsp;2007, we completed a merger with BTHC VI, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary that was
formed for the
purpose of completing the merger. BTHC VI was a public shell corporation with substantially no
assets, liabilities or operations. We continued as the surviving entity in the merger and our
business became the sole operations of BTHC VI after the merger. BTHC VI&#146;s acquisition of us
effected a change in control and was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby we were the
accounting acquirer for financial statement purposes. Accordingly, our financial statements
present our historical results and do not include the historical financial results of BTHC VI prior
to the merger. At the time the merger was effective, each share of common stock of Athersys was
exchanged into 0.0358493 shares of BTHC VI common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Prior to the
merger, BTHC VI effected a 1-for-1.67 reverse stock split of its shares of common stock and
increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to 100,000,000. Athersys&#146; authorized and
issued shares of common and preferred stock have been retroactively restated for all periods
presented to reflect the merger exchange ratio of 0.0358493. Basic and diluted net loss per share
attributable to common stockholders have been computed using the retroactively restated common
stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with the merger in June&nbsp;2007, Athersys negotiated with holders of its convertible
preferred stock a planned restructuring of its capital stock, which included the conversion of the
preferred stock into shares of its common stock, the termination of warrants issued to the former
holders of Class&nbsp;C Convertible Preferred Stock, and the elimination of accrued dividends payable to
the former holders of Class&nbsp;C Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result, immediately prior to the
consummation of the merger with BTHC VI, all convertible preferred stock (including termination of
warrants and elimination of accrued dividends) was converted into 53,341,747 shares of common
stock. The change to the conversion ratios of the convertible preferred stock was deemed to be an
induced conversion, which resulted in a $4.8&nbsp;million deemed dividend and an increase to the net
loss attributable to common stockholders in June&nbsp;2007. Upon the closing of the merger, the
53,341,747 shares of common stock were exchanged for 1,912,356 shares of BTHC VI common stock using
the merger exchange ratio. Athersys also retired all shares of stock held in treasury.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Immediately after the merger, we completed an offering of 13,000,000 shares of common stock for
aggregate gross proceeds of $65.0&nbsp;million in June&nbsp;2007, which included the issuance of warrants to
purchase 3,250,000 shares of common stock to the investors. We also issued warrants to purchase
500,000 shares of common stock to the lead investor and warrants to purchase 1,093,525 shares of
common stock to the placement agents. The placement agents also received cash fees in an amount
equal to approximately $5.5&nbsp;million, which was based on 8.5% of the gross proceeds, excluding
proceeds from existing investors. In consideration for certain advisory services, we paid an
affiliate of BTHC VI&#146;s then-largest stockholder a one-time fee of $350,000 in cash upon
consummation of the merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Upon the closing of the June offering, the $10.0&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of convertible
notes issued to Angiotech were converted along with accrued interest into 1,885,890 shares of
common stock at a conversion price of $5.50 per share, which was 110% of the price per share in the
June offering, in accordance with the terms of the notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Upon the closing of the June offering, the notes issued to bridge investors were converted along
with accrued interest into 531,781 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $5.00 per share,
which was the price per share in the June offering. The bridge investors also exercised their
$0.01 warrants upon the conversion of the convertible preferred stock in connection with the merger
for 999,977 shares of common stock at an aggregate exercise price of $10,000. Upon the conversion
of the bridge notes, the bridge investors also received five-year warrants to purchase 132,945
shares of common stock at $6.00 per share, which terms were consistent with the warrants issued to
new investors in the June offering.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2007, Athersys terminated the majority of stock option awards to its officers, employees,
directors and consultants. Only a nominal number of option awards (5,052 option shares) held by
former employees and consultants were assumed by us. Upon closing the merger, options for 3,625,000
shares of common stock were issued under our equity incentive plans to employees, directors and
consultants with an exercise price of $5.00 per share, resulting in stock compensation expense of
$5.1&nbsp;million in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Also in May&nbsp;2007, Athersys sold certain non-core technology related to its asthma discovery program
to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for $2.0&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have incurred losses since inception of operations in December&nbsp;1995 and had an accumulated
deficit of $178&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2008. Our losses have resulted principally from costs
incurred in research and development, clinical and preclinical product development, acquisition and
licensing costs, and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We have used
the financing proceeds from private equity and debt offerings and other sources of capital to
develop our technologies, to discover and develop therapeutic product candidates and to acquire
certain technologies and assets. We have also built drug development capabilities that have enabled
us to advance product candidates into clinical trials. We have established strategic collaborations
that have provided revenues and capabilities to help further advance our product candidates, and we
have also built a substantial portfolio of intellectual property.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Results of Operations</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since our inception, our revenues have consisted of license fees and milestone payments from our
collaborators and grant proceeds primarily from federal and state grants. We have derived no
revenue on the sale of FDA-approved products to date. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of costs associated with external clinical and preclinical study fees, manufacturing
costs, salaries and related personnel costs, legal expenses resulting from intellectual property
application processes, and laboratory supply and reagent costs. We expense research and development
costs as they are incurred. We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and
development to enhance our technologies, advance clinical trials of our product candidates, expand
our regulatory affairs and product development capabilities, conduct preclinical studies of our
products and manufacture our products. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of
salaries and related personnel costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses. To date, we
have financed our operations through private equity and debt financing and investments by strategic
collaborators. We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through at least the next several
years.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Revenues. </I>Revenues decreased to $3.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 from
$3.3&nbsp;million for 2007. Grant revenue decreased $0.6&nbsp;million primarily due to the completion of a
2006 state grant in October&nbsp;2008 as well as the timing of expenditures that are reimbursed with
grant proceeds. License fee revenues increased $0.4&nbsp;million as a result of the nature and timing
of target acceptances under our collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb and the
achievement of a clinical development milestone in September&nbsp;2008. During 2009, our revenues may
fluctuate compared to 2008 based on the timing of Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s demand for targets and the
timing of our work and based on the achievement and timing of Bristol-Myers Squibb milestones, if
any. Beyond 2009, we anticipate that Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s demand for new targets will be
reduced. Additionally, our grant revenues could fluctuate during any year based on the timing of
grant-related activities and the award of new grants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Research and Development Expenses. </I>Research and development expenses increased to $16.5&nbsp;million in
2008 from $15.8&nbsp;million in 2007. The increase of approximately $0.7&nbsp;million related primarily to
an increase in clinical and preclinical development costs of $2.2&nbsp;million, an increase in patent
legal fees of $395,000, an increase in research supplies expenses of $170,000 and an increase in
personnel costs of $111,000 in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease in stock compensation expense of $1.7&nbsp;million, a decrease in other expenses of $390,000
and a decrease in sponsored research of $72,000 in 2008 compared to 2007. The $2.2&nbsp;million
increase in preclinical and clinical costs is a result of the completion of the ATHX-105 phase I
clinical trial, preparations for the ATHX-105 phase II clinical trial, completion of two additional
phase I trials in the United Kingdom, performance of ATHX-105 non-clinical studies, and increases
in MultiStem preclinical and clinical costs and manufacturing expenses. Our clinical costs in 2008
and 2007 are reflected net of Angiotech&#146;s cost-sharing amount related to our MultiStem acute
myocardial infarction collaboration in the amount of $943,000 and $63,000, respectively. The
increase in patent legal fees for 2008 was a result of maintaining our growing and maturing
portfolio of patent applications, including prosecution costs for several cases that entered the
national phase in 2008. Personnel costs increased due to the addition of personnel in support of
our clinical programs, annual salary increases and increased benefit costs, which was partially
offset by the absence of bonus payments in 2008. The decrease in other expenses was primarily a
result of a milestone payment in 2007 in the amount of $1.0&nbsp;million associated with a stem cell
collaboration milestone and a stem cell IND milestone and was paid to the former owners of the
technology. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in outsourced research and
development expenses. We expect our research and development expenses to decrease in 2009,
primarily as a result of the decision to suspend further development of ATHX-105, partially offset
by expected increases in clinical development costs associated with our MultiStem programs. Other
than external expenses for our clinical and preclinical programs, we do not track our research
expenses by project; rather, we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>General and Administrative Expenses. </I>General and administrative expenses decreased to $5.5&nbsp;million
in 2008 from $8.0&nbsp;million in 2007. The $2.5&nbsp;million decrease was due primarily to a decrease in
stock compensation expense of $1.5&nbsp;million, decrease in other expenses of $572,000, decrease in
personnel costs of $261,000 , and a decrease in
legal and professional fees of $133,000. The decrease in other expenses for 2008 was primarily as
result of a one-time advisory fee of $350,000 in 2007 related to the merger. Personnel costs
decreased due to the absence of bonus payments in 2008, which was partially offset by the addition
of administrative support personnel, annual salary increases and increased benefit costs. The
decrease in legal and professional fees in 2008 was primarily a result of reduced legal fees
incurred in connection with SEC filings and transactional work. We expect our general and
administrative expenses to continue at similar levels in 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Depreciation. </I>Depreciation expense decreased to $218,000 in 2008 from $283,000 in 2007. The
decrease in depreciation expense was due to more laboratory equipment, computer equipment,
furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Other Income. </I>In May&nbsp;2007, Athersys sold certain non-core technology related to its asthma
discovery program to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for $2.0&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Interest Income. </I>Interest income decreased to $1.1&nbsp;million in 2008 from $1.6&nbsp;million in 2007. The
change in interest income was due to the receipt and investment of the proceeds from the equity
offering in June&nbsp;2007, the proceeds of which have been declining as they are used to fund
operations. Due to declining interest rates and lower cash balances as a result of our ongoing and
planned clinical and preclinical development, we expect our 2009 interest income to be less than
2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Interest Expense. </I>Interest expense on Athersys&#146; debt outstanding under its senior loan and its
subordinated convertible promissory notes decreased to $94,000 in 2008 from $1.3&nbsp;million in 2007.
The decrease in interest expense was due to the repayment of the senior loan in June&nbsp;2008,
conversion in June&nbsp;2007 of $2.5&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible
promissory notes issued to bridge investors, and conversion in June&nbsp;2007 of $10&nbsp;million in
aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible promissory notes issued to Angiotech. We do
not expect any significant interest expense in 2009 unless we incur new debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Accretion of Premium on Convertible Debt. </I>The accretion of premium on convertible debt of $0.5
million in 2007 relates to the $2.5&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated secured
convertible promissory notes issued to bridge investors in 2006 that were converted into common
stock upon the closing of the equity offering in June&nbsp;2007. The notes, if not converted, were
repayable with accrued interest at maturity, plus a repayment fee of 200% of the outstanding
principal. Athersys computed a premium on the debt in the amount of $5.25&nbsp;million due upon
redemption, which was being accreted over the term of the notes using the effective interest
method. The unamortized premium was reversed and recorded in additional paid-in-capital when the
notes were converted in June&nbsp;2007.

$3.7&nbsp;million for 2006. License fee revenues decreased $0.5&nbsp;million as a result of the nature and

2007 from $9.7&nbsp;million in 2006. The increase of approximately $6.1&nbsp;million related primarily to an
increase in clinical and preclinical development costs of $3.0&nbsp;million, an increase in stock
compensation expense of $2.2&nbsp;million, an increase in other expenses of $1.0&nbsp;million and an increase
in patent legal fees of $0.5&nbsp;million in 2007 compared to 2006. These increases were partially
offset by a decrease in research supplies expenses of $529,000, a decrease in sponsored research of
$114,000 and a decrease in facilities costs of $117,000 in 2007 compared to 2006. The $3.0&nbsp;million
increase in preclinical and clinical costs is a result of the initiation of the ATHX-105 phase I
clinical trial, performance of ATHX-105 non-clinical studies, and increases in MultiStem
preclinical and clinical costs and manufacturing expenses. Included in other expenses for 2007
were two milestone payments totaling $1.0&nbsp;million in cash and stock associated with a collaboration
milestone and an IND milestone related to our stem cell technology paid to the former owners of the
technology. In 2006, other expenses included a milestone payment of $125,000 paid in stock related
to a patent milestone covering the stem cell technology. These were the final milestone
payments to be made by us under the agreement governing the acquisition of the stem cell
technology. The increase in patent legal fees for 2007 was a result of maintaining our growing and
maturing portfolio of patent applications and the performance of patent legal work related to the
May&nbsp;2007 asthma asset sale. Included in personnel costs for 2007 and 2006 was approximately
$447,000 and $121,000, respectively, of bonus payments related to the achievement of certain
milestones. We do not track our research expenses by project; rather, we track such expenses by
the type of cost incurred.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>General and Administrative Expenses. </I>General and administrative expenses increased to $8.0&nbsp;million
in 2007 from $3.3&nbsp;million in 2006. The increase was due primarily to an increase in stock
compensation expense of $2.5&nbsp;million, an increase in other expenses of $1.4&nbsp;million, an increase in
legal and professional fees of $575,000 and an increase in personnel and facilities costs of
$135,000. Included in other expenses for 2007 was a one-time advisory fee of $350,000 related to
the merger, an allowance against a loan receivable in the amount of $193,000, and $1.3&nbsp;million of
other general and administrative costs such as printing costs for SEC filings, Nasdaq listing fees,
directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance costs, investor and public relations costs, recruiting costs and
costs related to compliance with Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Included in
personnel costs for 2007 and 2006 was approximately $475,000 and $89,000, respectively, of bonus
payments related to the achievement of certain milestones. Also included in personnel costs in May
2006 was approximately $122,000 ($146,000 including tax) in connection with the forgiveness of a
2002 loan made to our Chief Executive Officer. The increase in legal and professional fees in 2007
was primarily a result of legal fees incurred in connection with SEC filings, accounting and
auditing fees incurred in connection with SEC filings and fees for our board of directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Depreciation. </I>Depreciation expense decreased to $283,000 in 2007 from $528,000 in 2006. The
decrease in depreciation expense was due to more laboratory equipment, computer equipment,
furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Other Income and Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliate. </I>In May&nbsp;2007, Athersys sold
certain non-core technology related to its asthma discovery program to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for
$2.0&nbsp;million. In January&nbsp;2006, a milestone was achieved related to Athersys&#146; joint venture with
Oculus. As a result, Athersys received $100,000 of stock-based proceeds from Oculus, which was
recorded in other income. Similarly, Oculus also received stock-based proceeds in another company
in the amount of $260,000. Athersys recorded its share of Oculus&#146; net income (after recapturing
past net losses) of $117,000 in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate in 2006.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Interest Income. </I>Interest income increased to $1.6&nbsp;million in 2007 from $119,000 in 2006. The
change in interest income was due to the receipt and investment of the proceeds from the equity
offering in June&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Interest Expense. </I>Interest expense on Athersys&#146; debt outstanding under its senior loan and its
subordinated convertible promissory notes increased to $1.3&nbsp;million for 2007 from $1.0&nbsp;million in
2006. The increase in interest expense was due to the $2.5&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of
subordinated convertible promissory notes issued by Athersys to its bridge investors in October
2006, and the $10&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible promissory
notes issued to Angiotech in 2006 and 2007. These convertible promissory notes were converted in
the equity offering in June&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Accretion of Premium on Convertible Debt. </I>The accretion of premium on convertible debt was $0.5
million in 2007 and $0.3&nbsp;million in 2006. The accretion relates to the $2.5&nbsp;million in aggregate
principal amount of subordinated secured convertible promissory notes issued to bridge investors in
October&nbsp;2006 that were converted into common stock upon the closing of the equity offering in June
2007. The notes, if not converted, were repayable with accrued interest at maturity, plus a
repayment fee of 200% of the outstanding principal. Athersys computed a premium on the debt in the
amount of $5.25&nbsp;million due upon redemption, which was being accreted over the term of the notes
using the effective interest method. The unamortized premium was reversed and recorded in
additional paid-in-capital when the notes were converted in June&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle. </I>Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, Athersys adopted
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) using the modified-prospective-transition
method. SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) requires Athersys to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense
relating to share-based compensation, while previously Athersys was permitted to recognize
forfeitures as an expense reduction upon occurrence. The adjustment to apply estimated forfeitures
to previously recognized share-based compensation was accounted for as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle at January&nbsp;1, 2006 and reduced net loss by
$306,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our sources of liquidity include our cash balances and available-for-sale securities. At
December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had $12.6&nbsp;million in cash and cash equivalents and $19.1&nbsp;million in
available-for-sale securities. Athersys has primarily financed its operations through private
equity and debt financings that have resulted in aggregate cumulative proceeds of approximately
$200&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb successfully advanced into phase II clinical development a
drug candidate discovered using a target provided by us, thereby triggering a clinical development
milestone payment to us. Our collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which was
initially established in 2001, is now in its final phase. We intend to continue to prepare and
deliver validated drug targets for use by Bristol-Myers Squibb in its drug discovery efforts until
the collaboration objectives have been fulfilled. We will remain entitled to receive license fees
for targets delivered to Bristol-Myers Squibb, as well as milestone payments and royalties on
compounds developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb using our technology.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our available-for-sale securities typically include United States government obligations, corporate
debt securities, floating rate notes and commercial paper. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, approximately
72% of our investments were in United States government obligations. We have been investing
conservatively due to the current economic conditions, including the current credit crisis, and
have prioritized liquidity and the preservation of principal in lieu of potentially higher returns.
As a result, we have experienced no losses on the principal of our investments and have held our
investments until maturity. Also, although these unfavorable market and economic conditions have
resulted in a decrease to our market capitalization, there has been no impairment to the value of
our assets. Our fixed assets are used for internal research and development and, therefore, are
not impacted by these external factors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We will require substantial additional funding in order to continue our research and product
development programs, including preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates.
Based on current plans, we anticipate using $11&nbsp;million to $13&nbsp;million of our cash (net of cash
inflows) to fund our activities in 2009, which includes clinical trial costs to advance our
MultiStem programs and reflects a reduction in costs from 2008 as a result of the suspension of the
ATHX-105 clinical program early in 2009. We expect to have available cash to fund our operations
through 2011 based on our current business and operational plans and assuming no new financings.
Our funding requirements may change at any time due to technological advances or competition from
other companies. Our future capital requirements will also depend on numerous other factors,
including scientific progress in our research and development programs, additional personnel costs,
progress in preclinical testing and clinical trials, the time and cost related to proposed
regulatory approvals, if any, and the costs in filing and prosecuting patent applications and
enforcing patent claims. We cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available to us or, if
available, that it will be available on acceptable terms, particularly in light of the current
credit crisis. Any shortfall in funding could result in our having to curtail our research and
development efforts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through at least the next several years and may
incur losses in subsequent periods. The amount and timing of our future losses are highly
uncertain. Our ability to achieve and thereafter sustain profitability will be dependent upon,
among other things, successfully developing, commercializing and obtaining regulatory approval or
clearances for our technologies and products resulting from these technologies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net cash used in operating activities was $15.7&nbsp;million, $12.1&nbsp;million and $8.4&nbsp;million in 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively, and represented the use of cash in funding clinical and preclinical
product development activities. We expect that net cash used in operating activities will decrease
in 2009 primarily as a result of the decision to suspend further development of ATHX-105, which
will be partially offset by expected increases in clinical development costs associated with our
MultiStem programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net cash provided by investing activities was $16.8&nbsp;million in 2008 and $3.4&nbsp;million in 2006. Net
cash used in investing activities was $36.4&nbsp;million in 2007. The fluctuations from period to period
are due to the timing of purchases and maturity dates of investments and the purchase of equipment.
Purchases of equipment were $532,000,
$161,000 and $83,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We expect that our capital equipment
expenditures will continue at similar levels in 2009 compared to 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Financing activities used cash of $1.8&nbsp;million in 2008 and provided cash of $60.2&nbsp;million in 2007
and $5.4&nbsp;million in 2006. These fluctuations relate primarily to proceeds from the equity offering
in June&nbsp;2007, the issuance of convertible promissory notes in 2007 and 2006 to Angiotech and the
bridge investors in 2006, and repayments of our senior loan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Investors in the equity offering in June&nbsp;2007 also received five-year warrants to purchase an
aggregate of 3,250,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $6.00 per share. The lead
investor in the June offering, Radius Venture Partners, invested $10.0&nbsp;million in the June offering
and received additional five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 500,000 shares of common
stock with a cash or cashless exercise price of $6.00 per share. The placement agents for the June
offering received five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,093,525 shares of common stock
with a cash or cashless exercise price of $6.00 per share. The exercise of such warrants could
provide us with cash proceeds. No warrants have been exercised at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our senior loan was repaid in full in June&nbsp;2008. The senior lenders retain a right to receive a
milestone payment of $2.25&nbsp;million upon the occurrence of certain events as follows: (1)&nbsp;the entire
amount upon (a)&nbsp;the merger with or into another entity where our stockholders do not hold at least
a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity, (b)&nbsp;the sale of all or substantially all
of our assets, or (c)&nbsp;our liquidation or dissolution; or (2)&nbsp;a portion of the amount from proceeds
of equity financings not tied to specific research and development activities that are part of a
research or development collaboration, in which case, the senior lenders will receive an amount
equal to 10% of proceeds above $5.0&nbsp;million in cumulative gross proceeds until the milestone amount
is paid in full. The milestone payment is payable in cash, except that if the milestone event is
(2)&nbsp;above, we may elect to pay 75% of the milestone in shares of common stock at the per-share
offering price. No milestone events have occurred as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. The senior lenders
also received warrants to purchase 149,026 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $5.00
upon the closing of our equity offering in June&nbsp;2007. The exercise of such warrants could provide
us with cash proceeds. No warrants were exercised at December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with our 2006 MultiStem collaboration with Angiotech, Angiotech purchased
subordinated convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $10.0&nbsp;million, which
were converted along with accrued interest into common stock upon the closing of our equity
offering in June&nbsp;2007. Upon the successful achievement of specified clinical development and
commercialization milestones, we may also receive up to $3.75&nbsp;million of additional equity
investments and $63.75&nbsp;million of aggregate cash payments, though there can be no assurance that we
will achieve any milestones.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the terms of the collaboration, the parties are jointly funding clinical development
activity, whereby preclinical costs are borne solely by us, costs for phase I and phase II clinical
trials are borne 50% by us and 50% by Angiotech, costs for the first phase III clinical trial will
be borne 33% by us and 67% by Angiotech, and costs for any phase III clinical trials subsequent to
the first phase III clinical trial will be borne 25% by us and 75% by Angiotech. We have lead
responsibility for preclinical and early clinical development and manufacturing of the MultiStem
product, and Angiotech will take the lead on pivotal and later clinical trials and
commercialization. Late in 2007, the parties began to share costs for phase I clinical development,
which is reconciled quarterly. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, $234,000 was due from Angiotech
representing its share of costs for the fourth quarter of 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We will receive nearly half of the net profits from the sale of any jointly developed, approved
products. In addition, we will retain the commercial rights to MultiStem for all other therapeutic
applications, including treatment of stroke, bone marrow transplantation and oncology support,
blood and immune system disorders, autoimmune disease, and other indications that we may elect to
pursue. In September&nbsp;2008, Angiotech announced certain reorganization initiatives to reduce its
costs, citing the need for a potential amendment and reduction in cash outlays related to our
collaboration, among a list of several selected actions. At this time, no such amendment or
reduction has been made to our collaboration, and Angiotech continues to fund its share of phase I
costs on a timely basis. In the event that Angiotech fails to fund its obligations under the terms
of our contract, our costs for the phase I clinical trial would increase or the clinical trial may
be curtailed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have an operating lease for our office and laboratory space with options to renew through March
2013 at the existing rental rate. We exercised options to renew the lease through March&nbsp;2010. In
2008, we entered into a three-year lease agreement for office and laboratory space for our Belgian
subsidiary with an annual rent of approximately $42,000, subject to annual adjustments based on an
inflationary index. The lease includes an option to renew for four additional years, through
December&nbsp;31, 2014.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The research funding in the table above represents our current funding commitment for a four-year
research program that began in 2007. We approved the funding for the first two years of research
programs; however, funding for the remaining two years is subject to our continuation of the
program and approval of the annual research plans. If we approve funding for the remaining two
years of the program, we will be obligated to contribute additional funding for the program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We filed a resale registration statement with the SEC for 18,508,251 shares of common stock, which
includes all shares of common stock issued in the equity offering in June&nbsp;2007 and shares of common
stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in the offering (as well as the 531,781 shares
of common stock issued to the bridge investors and the 132,945 shares underlying their warrants).
The resale registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October&nbsp;18, 2007. Under the
registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the offering, subject to certain
exceptions, if the resale registration statement ceases to remain effective, a 1% cash penalty will
be assessed for each 30-day period until the registration statement becomes effective again, capped
at 10% of the aggregate gross proceeds we received from the equity offering. Because the penalty
is based on the number of unregistered shares of common stock held by investors in the offering,
our maximum penalty exposure will decline over time as investors sell their shares of common stock
that were included in the registration statement.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management&#146;s view, important to
the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and demanding of management&#146;s
judgment. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based on
Athersys&#146; consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A discussion of the material implications of uncertainties associated with the methods, assumptions
and estimates
underlying our critical accounting polices is as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
No.&nbsp;104, Revenue Recognition, and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, No.&nbsp;00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which provide guidance on revenue recognition in financial
statements and are based on the interpretations and practices developed by the SEC. Our license
and collaboration agreements may contain multiple elements, including technology access and
development fees, cost-sharing, milestones and royalties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our license fee revenue primarily consists of fees received from a collaborator, which are
specifically set forth in the license and collaboration agreement as amounts due to us based on our
completion of certain tasks (e.g., delivery and acceptance of a cell line) and development
milestones (e.g., clinical trial phases) and as such are not based on estimates that are
susceptible to change. Such amounts are invoiced and recorded as revenue as tasks are completed,
and as milestones are achieved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Similarly, revenue from grants consists of funding under cost reimbursement programs primarily from
federal and state sources for qualified research and development activities performed by us and as
such are not based on estimates that are susceptible to change. Such amounts are invoiced (unless
prepaid) and recorded as revenue as tasks are completed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Collaborative Arrangements</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Collaborative arrangements that involve cost or future profit sharing are reviewed to determine the
nature of the arrangement and the nature of the collaborative parties&#146; businesses. The
arrangements are also reviewed to determine if one party has sole or primary responsibility for an
activity, or whether the parties have shared responsibility for the activity. If responsibility
for an activity is shared and there is no principal party, then the related costs of that activity
are recognized by us on a net basis in the statement of operations (e.g., total cost, less
reimbursement from collaborator). If we are deemed to be the principal party for an activity, then
the costs and revenues associated with that activity are recognized on a gross basis in the
statement of operations. The accounting may be susceptible to change if the nature of a
collaborator&#146;s business changes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Clinical Trial Costs</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Clinical trial costs are accrued based on work performed by outside contractors who manage and
perform the trials. We obtain initial estimates of total costs based on enrollment of subjects,
project management estimates and other activities. Actual costs are typically charged to us and
recognized as the tasks are completed by the contractor. Accrued clinical trial costs may be
subject to revisions as clinical trials progress, and any revisions are recorded in the period in
which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. Since such actual costs are
typically invoiced as incurred, the amounts are not based on estimates that are susceptible to
change.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Investments in Available-for-Sale Securities</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No.&nbsp;157 related
to our financial assets and liabilities on January&nbsp;1, 2008, and accordingly, we determine the
appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such
designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investments typically consist primarily of United
States government obligations, corporate debt securities, floating rate notes and commercial paper,
all of which are classified as available-for-sale and are valued based on quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets (Level 1). Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value,
with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization or accretion is included in
interest income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in
interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
Interest earned on securities classified as available-for-sale is included in interest income.
Since the elements related to accounting for these investments are reflected on monthly statements,
the amounts are not based on estimates that are susceptible to change.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In October&nbsp;2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Staff Position, or
FSP, FAS 157-3, <I>Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is
Not Active</I>, which clarifies the application of SFAS No.&nbsp;157, <I>Fair Value Measurements</I>, in a market
that is not active and illustrates key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial
asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. This FSP did not have an impact on
our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R)
using the modified-prospective-transition method. We recognize expense on the straight-line method.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We use a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of share-based
awards under SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R). The expected term of options granted represent the period of time
that option grants are expected to be outstanding. We use the &#147;simplified&#148; method under SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No.&nbsp;110 to calculate the expected life of option grants in 2008 and 2007 given
our limited history. We determine volatility by using the historical stock volatility of other
companies with similar characteristics. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual
future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If actual
forfeitures vary from the estimate, we will recognize the difference in compensation expense in the
period the actual forfeitures occur or when options vest.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of the aforementioned estimates and assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis and may
change as facts and circumstances warrant. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the
estimate of the fair value of our share-based payments and the related amount recognized in our
financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Recently Issued Accounting Standards</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached in EITF Issue No.&nbsp;07-1, <I>Accounting for
Collaborative Arrangements. </I>The effective date of EITF 07-1 is January&nbsp;1, 2009 for calendar year
companies with retrospective application required for all periods presented for collaborative
arrangements existing as of the effective date. EITF 07-1 requires certain disclosures related to
collaborative arrangements where parties are active participants and exposed to significant risks
and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. We do not expect its adoption to
have a material impact on our financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position APB 14-1, or FSP 14-1, <I>Accounting for Convertible
Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)</I>.
FSP 14-1 requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on
conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that reflects
the issuer&#146;s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. We currently have no convertible debt
instruments, but are evaluating the retrospective effect that FSP 14-1 may have on our financial
statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;141R, <I>Business Combinations</I>. This statement, which
addresses the accounting for business acquisitions, is effective for fiscal years beginning on or
after December&nbsp;15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited, and generally applies to business
acquisitions completed after December&nbsp;31, 2008. Among other things, the new standard requires that
all acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred, and that all restructuring costs related to
acquired operations be expensed as incurred. This new standard also addresses the current and
subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies acquired or assumed. We
do not expect its adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements. SFAS No.&nbsp;141R
could have a material impact on our financial statements in future periods if we complete a
significant acquisition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our exposure to interest rate risk is related to our investment portfolio and our borrowings. Fixed
rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in
interest rates. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of
expectations. Further, we may suffer losses in investment principal if we are forced to sell
securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. We invest our
excess cash primarily in debt instruments of the United States government and its agencies,
corporate debt securities, floating-rate notes and A1&#043;/P1 commercial paper. As of December&nbsp;31,
2008, approximately 72% of our investments were in United States government obligations. We have
been investing conservatively due to the current economic conditions, including the current credit
crisis, and have prioritized liquidity and the preservation of principal in lieu of potentially
higher returns. As a result, we have experienced no losses on the principal of our investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We enter into loan arrangements with financial institutions when needed and when available to us.
At December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Athersys, Inc. as of December&nbsp;31,
2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity
(deficit)&nbsp;and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item&nbsp;15(a)(2). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Athersys, Inc. at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123(R), <I>Share-Based Payment</I>, effective January

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>A. Background, Merger and Offering</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Athersys, Inc. (&#147;Athersys&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the
discovery and development of therapeutic products in one business segment. Operations consist
primarily of research and product development activities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">On June&nbsp;8, 2007, Athersys&#146; subsidiary, which was then named Athersys, Inc. (&#147;Old Athersys&#148;),
effected a merger into a wholly-owned subsidiary of a public company (the &#147;Merger&#148;). The public
company, BTHC VI, Inc. (&#147;BTHC VI&#148;), was a shell corporation with no assets, liabilities or
operations as of the date of the Merger and had 299,622 shares of common stock outstanding. Upon
completion of the Merger, the officers and directors of Old Athersys assumed control over the
operations of BTHC VI, and Old Athersys&#146; operations became the sole operations of BTHC VI on a
consolidated basis. In August&nbsp;2007, BTHC VI changed its name to Athersys, Inc.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Prior to the consummation of the Merger, Old Athersys negotiated with holders of its convertible
preferred stock a planned restructuring of its capital stock, which included the conversion of its
preferred stock into shares of Old Athersys&#146; common stock, the termination of warrants issued to
the former holders of Class&nbsp;C Convertible Preferred Stock, and the elimination of accrued dividends
payable to the former holders of Class&nbsp;C Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result, immediately
prior to the consummation of the Merger, all convertible preferred stock (including termination of
warrants and elimination of accrued dividends) was converted into 53,341,747 shares of common
stock. The change to the conversion ratios of the convertible preferred stock was deemed to be an
induced conversion, which resulted in a $4.8&nbsp;million deemed dividend and an increase to the net
loss attributable to common stockholders in June&nbsp;2007. Upon the closing of the Merger, the
53,341,747 shares of Old Athersys common stock were exchanged for 1,912,356 shares of BTHC VI
common stock using the Merger exchange ratio. Old Athersys also retired all shares of stock held
in treasury.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At the time the Merger was effective, each share of Old Athersys&#146; common stock was exchanged into
0.0358493 shares of BTHC VI common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Prior to the Merger, BTHC VI
effected a 1-for-1.67 reverse stock split of its shares of common stock and increased the number of
authorized shares of common stock to 100,000,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">BTHC VI&#146;s acquisition of Old Athersys effected a change in control and was accounted for as a
reverse acquisition whereby Old Athersys is the accounting acquirer for financial statement
purposes. Accordingly, the financial statements of the Company presented reflect the historical
results of Old Athersys and do not include the historical financial results of BTHC VI prior to the
consummation of the Merger. The Company&#146;s authorized and issued shares of common and preferred
stock have been retroactively restated for all periods presented to reflect the Merger
exchange rate of 0.0358493. Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common
stockholders has been computed using the retroactively restated common stock.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>A. Background, Merger and Offering, continued</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Immediately after the Merger, the Company completed an offering of 13,000,000 shares of common
stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $65,000,000 (the &#147;Offering&#148;). Offering costs in the amount of
approximately $6.5&nbsp;million were netted against the proceeds of the Offering, resulting in net
proceeds from the Offering of approximately $58.5&nbsp;million. The Offering included the issuance of
warrants to purchase 3,250,000 shares of common stock to the investors with an exercise price of
$6.00 and a five-year term. The Company also issued warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of common
stock to the lead investor and warrants to purchase 1,093,525 shares of common stock to the
placement agents, all with an exercise price of $6.00 and five-year terms. The placement agents
also received a cash fee in an amount equal to 8.5% of the gross proceeds, less proceeds from
existing investors in Old Athersys. In consideration for certain advisory services, Old Athersys
paid an affiliate and largest stockholder of BTHC VI a one-time fee of $350,000 in cash upon
consummation of the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Upon the closing of the Offering, the $10.0&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes
issued to Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Angiotech&#148;) (see Note F) were converted along with
accrued interest into 1,885,890 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $5.50 per share,
which was 110% of the price per share in the Offering, in accordance with the terms of the notes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Upon the closing of the Offering, the notes issued to bridge investors (see Note G) were converted
along with accrued interest into 531,781 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $5.00 per
share, which was the price per share in the Offering, in accordance with the terms of the bridge
notes. The bridge investors also exercised their $0.01 warrants upon the conversion of the
convertible preferred stock in connection with the Merger for 999,977 shares of common stock at an
aggregate exercise price of $10,000. Upon the conversion of the bridge notes, the bridge investors
also received five-year warrants to purchase 132,945 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share,
which terms were consistent with the warrants issued to new investors in the Offering.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company filed a resale registration statement with the SEC for 18,508,251 shares of common
stock, which includes all shares of common stock issued in the Offering and shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in the Offering (as well as the 531,781 shares of
common stock issued to the bridge investors and the 132,945 shares underlying their warrants). The
resale registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October&nbsp;18, 2007. Under the
purchase agreement entered into in connection with the Offering, subject to certain exceptions, if
the resale registration statement ceases to remain
effective, a 1% cash penalty will be assessed for each 30-day period until the registration
statement becomes effective again, capped at 10% of the aggregate gross proceeds received in
the Offering. Because the penalty is based on the number of unregistered shares of common stock
held by investors in the Offering, the Company&#146;s maximum penalty exposure will decline over time as
investors sell their shares of common stock that were included in the registration statement.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method when the
Company does not control the investee, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over
the investee&#146;s operations and financial policies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Revenue Recognition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company&#146;s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
(&#147;SAB&#148;) No.&nbsp;104, <I>Revenue Recognition</I>, and Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) No.&nbsp;00-21, <I>Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables</I>, which provide guidance on revenue recognition in financial
statements and are based on the interpretations and practices developed by the SEC. The Company&#146;s
license and collaboration agreements may contain multiple elements, including technology access and
development fees, cost-sharing, milestones and royalties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Revenue from transactions that do not require future performance obligations from the Company is
recognized when performance is complete and when collectability is reasonably assured. The
Company&#146;s license fee revenue primarily consists of fees received from a collaborator, which are
specifically set forth in the license and collaboration agreement as amounts due to the Company
based on its completion of certain tasks (e.g., delivery and acceptance of a cell line). Upon
acceptance by the collaborator of a cell line for use in its own product development efforts, the
Company has no further performance obligations with respect to the cell line or products
developed using the cell line. In addition, the Company receives specified payments upon the
collaborator&#146;s achievement of certain developmental milestones (e.g., clinical trial phases), which
are recognized when the milestones are achieved by the Company&#146;s collaborator.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds and
commercial paper. The carrying amount of the Company&#146;s cash equivalents approximates fair value due
to the short maturity of the investments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Research and development expenditures, which consist primarily of costs associated with external
clinical and preclinical study fees, manufacturing costs, salaries and related personnel costs,
legal expenses resulting from intellectual property application processes, and laboratory supply
and reagent costs, including direct and allocated overhead expenses, are charged to expense as
incurred.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Collaborative Arrangements</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Collaborative arrangements that involve cost or revenue sharing are reviewed to determine the
nature of the arrangement and the nature of the collaborative parties&#146; businesses. The
arrangements are also reviewed to determine if one party has sole or primary responsibility for an
activity, or whether the parties have shared responsibility for the activity. If responsibility
for an activity is shared and there is no principal party, then the related costs of that activity
are recognized by the Company on a net basis in the statement of operations (e.g., total cost, less
reimbursement from collaborator). If the Company is deemed to be the principal party for an
activity, then the costs and revenues associated with that activity are recognized on a gross basis
in the statement of operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Management determines the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of
purchase and re-evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company&#146;s investments
typically consist primarily of U.S. government obligations, corporate debt securities, floating
rate notes and commercial paper, all of which are classified as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net
of applicable tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amortized
cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to
maturity. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses
on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is
based on the specific identification method. Interest earned on securities classified as
available-for-sale is included in interest income.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Equipment is stated at acquired cost less accumulated depreciation. Laboratory and office equipment
are depreciated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (three to seven years).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In accordance with the guidance in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;144,
<I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets</I>, long-lived assets are evaluated for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset
or related group of assets may not be recoverable. If the expected future
undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is
recognized at that time. Measurement of impairment may be based upon appraisal, market value of
similar assets or discounted cash flows. No impairment losses were recorded in 2008, 2007 or 2006.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No.&nbsp;123 (revised 2004), <I>Share-Based Payment</I>, (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R)&#148;), using the
modified-prospective-transition method. Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized
since January&nbsp;1, 2006 included: (a)&nbsp;compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior
to, but not yet vested, as of January&nbsp;1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123, and (b)&nbsp;compensation cost for all
share-based payments granted subsequent to January&nbsp;1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R). For some of the awards granted
prior to the adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R), the Company recognized compensation expense using a
grading vesting method. For awards granted subsequent to adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R), the Company
recognizes expense on the straight-line method.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company uses a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of
share-based awards under SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R). The expected term of options granted represent the
period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses the
&#147;simplified&#148; method under SAB No.&nbsp;110 to calculate the expected life of option grants in 2008 and
2007 given its limited history. The Company determines volatility by using the historical stock
volatility of other companies with similar characteristics.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If actual
forfeitures vary from the estimate, the Company will recognize the difference in compensation
expense in the period the actual forfeitures occur or when options vest. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R), the Company was permitted to recognize forfeitures as an expense reduction upon
occurrence. The adjustment to apply estimated forfeitures to previously recognized share-based
compensation was accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle at
January&nbsp;1, 2006, and reduced net loss by $305,587 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006.

and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
reported or expected to be reported on a tax return as well as guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
Athersys adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January&nbsp;1, 2007. Upon adoption of FIN 48 and through
December&nbsp;31, 2008, Athersys determined that it had no liability for uncertain income taxes as
prescribed by FIN 48. Athersys&#146; policy is to recognize potential accrued interest and penalties
related to the liability for uncertain tax benefits, if applicable, in income tax expense. Net
operating loss and credit carryforwards since inception remain open to examination by taxing
authorities, and will for a period post utilization.

all acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred, and that all restructuring costs related to
acquired operations be expensed as incurred. SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R) also addresses the current and
subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies acquired or assumed.
The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R) to have a material impact on its
financial statements. SFAS No.&nbsp;141(R) could have a material impact on its financial statements in
future periods if the Company completes a significant acquisition in the future.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2003, the Company acquired MCL LLC (&#147;MCL&#148;) through a merger with one of its subsidiaries. The
Company acquired adult stem cell technologies through the merger. In addition to the purchase price
for the merger, the Company was obligated to make three milestone payments. The first milestone,
related to the issuance of a patent, was completed in 2006 resulting in the issuance of 2,758
shares of common stock to the former members of MCL. The value placed on the shares was
approximately $125,000 using a fair value estimate at the time of the milestone achievement. In
2007, the Company achieved the final two milestones, which related to collaborative activities and
the filing of an investigational new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The milestones resulted in the issuance of 1,379 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock and cash
payments of $1,000,000 in 2007. The value of the shares was approximately $7,000 using a fair
value estimate at the time of the milestone achievement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with the MCL merger, the Company received a $511,000 note issued by one of the former
owners of MCL. Principal and accrued interest is repayable (i)&nbsp;out of a percentage of proceeds from
the sale of shares of common stock held by the former owner (who owned 28,662 shares at December
31, 2008), and (ii)&nbsp;upon the achievement of the final cash milestone, $283,000 of the final cash
milestone can be withheld by Athersys as partial repayment of the note. The Company achieved the
final milestone in 2007 and therefore, withheld $283,000 of the milestone payment as partial
repayment on the note. The Company recorded an allowance of approximately $74,000 and $193,000 in
2008 and 2007, respectively, to reserve a portion of the note balance for which collectability is
uncertain, leaving a net balance of $12,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2008. In the event that the proceeds
from the sale of common stock by the former owner are insufficient to repay the principal and
interest in full, any remaining balance due will be forgiven by Athersys at that time.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2004, the Company issued $7.5&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of notes payable to lenders,
the proceeds of which were unrestricted and used for general corporate purposes. The notes were
payable in 30&nbsp;monthly installments after an initial interest-only period with a fixed interest rate
of 13%. The notes had a maturity date of June&nbsp;1, 2008 and included a terminal payment of $487,500
due at maturity. Deferred financing costs were capitalized in connection with the note, which were
amortized over the term of the note using the effective interest method.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The lenders retain a right to receive a milestone payment of $2.25&nbsp;million upon the occurrence of
certain events as clarified in the October&nbsp;2007 amendment to the loan agreement as follows: (1)&nbsp;the
entire amount upon (a)&nbsp;the merger with or into another entity where the Company&#146;s stockholders do
not hold at least a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity, (b)&nbsp;the sale of all or
substantially all of the Company&#146;s assets, or (c)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s liquidation or dissolution; or (2)
a portion of the amount from proceeds of equity financings not tied to specific research and
development activities that are part of a research or development collaboration, in which case, the
lenders will receive an amount equal to 10% of proceeds above $5.0&nbsp;million in cumulative gross
proceeds until the milestone amount is paid in full. The milestone payment is payable in cash,
except that if the milestone event is (2)&nbsp;above, the Company may elect to pay 75% of the milestone
in shares of common stock at the per-share offering price. No amounts have been recorded in
relation to the milestone as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 or 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The lenders also received warrants to purchase 149,026 shares of common stock with an exercise
price of $5.00 per share and a seven-year term upon the closing of the Offering in June&nbsp;2007 in
accordance with the loan agreement. The value of the warrants was $492,000 based on the
Black-Scholes valuation of the underlying security, of which $16,000 and $476,000 was recorded as
interest expense in 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Fair value of the Company&#146;s long-term debt at December&nbsp;31, 2007 was not determinable due to lack of
marketability of the fixed-rate debt. The Company paid interest of
$76,000, $456,000 and $832,000
during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2006, the Company entered into a co-development collaboration with Angiotech. The Company issued
a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $5.0&nbsp;million to Angiotech at the inception
of the program, which was followed by the issuance of an additional convertible promissory note in
the principal amount of $5.0&nbsp;million in January&nbsp;2007 upon the achievement of certain milestones.
The notes bore interest at 5% and had six-year terms. Upon the closing of the Offering, the
convertible notes aggregating $10.0&nbsp;million were converted along with accrued interest into
1,885,890 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $5.50 per
share, which was 110% of the price per share in the Offering, in accordance with the terms of the
notes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company may receive equity investments and cash payments based on the successful achievement of
specified clinical development and commercialization milestones. Under the terms of the
collaboration, preclinical costs are borne solely by the Company and the parties jointly fund
clinical development activity. The Company has primary responsibility for preclinical and early
clinical development and clinical manufacturing, and Angiotech will take the lead on pivotal and
later clinical trials and commercialization as further described below. The parties will share net
profits from the future sale of approved products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the terms of the collaboration, the parties jointly fund clinical development activity,
whereby costs for phase I and II studies are borne 50% by Athersys and 50% by Angiotech, costs for
the first phase III study will be borne 33% by Athersys and 67% by Angiotech, and costs for any
phase III studies subsequent to the first phase III study will be borne 25% by Athersys and 75% by
Angiotech. Late in 2007, the parties began to share costs for phase I clinical development. The
Company considered the provisions of EITF Issue No.&nbsp;07-1, <I>Accounting for Collaborative
Arrangements</I>, and determined that neither party is a principal party for clinical development
costs, since both the costs and responsibilities are shared and neither party is in the business of
conducting clinical development services for others. Therefore, the Company recorded clinical
development costs net of Angiotech&#146;s 50% cost-share, which amounted to $943,000 and $63,000 in 2008
and 2007, respectively. The amount due from Angiotech was $234,000 and $63,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2008
and 2007, respectively, and is disclosed separately on the balance sheet.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>G. Convertible Bridge Notes</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2006, the Company completed a bridge financing of $2.5&nbsp;million in the form of convertible
promissory notes. The notes were issued primarily to existing stockholders of the Company,
including $205,000 in the aggregate to three members of management. The notes bore interest at 10%
and had three-year terms. The notes were only convertible into shares of stock of the same class as
issued in the Company&#146;s next bona fide equity financing, at a conversion price equal to the price
per share in the bona fide equity financing. The notes, if not converted, were repayable with
accrued interest at maturity, plus a repayment fee of 200% of the outstanding principal.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The bridge investors also received warrants in connection with the bridge financing. The warrants
were exercisable for shares of common stock only upon a restructuring of the Company&#146;s capital
stock in connection with a bona fide financing. The number of shares that could be purchased under
the warrants was based on a formula whereby the bridge investors
would receive warrants valued at two times their investment divided by the pre-money value of the
Company upon a restructuring and bona fide equity financing. The exercise price of the warrants was
$0.01 per share.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company allocated $250,000 of the purchase price of the debt to the warrants based on the
relative fair value of the notes and the warrants. The Company computed a premium on the debt in
the amount of $5,250,000 due upon redemption, which was being accreted over the term of the notes
using the effective interest method.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Upon the closing of the Offering, the bridge notes were converted along with accrued interest into
531,781 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $5.00 per share. The unamortized premium
and discount on the notes were reversed and recorded in additional paid-in capital. The bridge
noteholders also exercised their warrants upon the closing of the Offering for 999,977 shares of
common stock at an aggregate exercise price of $10,000. Upon the conversion of the bridge notes,
the bridge noteholders also received five-year warrants to purchase 132,945 shares of common stock
at $6.00 per share, which terms were consistent with the warrants issued to new investors in the
Offering.

of undesignated preferred stock authorized. No shares of preferred stock have been issued as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Company may issue shares of common stock to its lenders and to Angiotech in connection with
future milestones (see Notes E and F). Also, the Company entered into a license and sponsored
research agreement in 2007 with an academic institution whereby, in addition to annual research
funding, the institution may receive 1,345 shares of common stock on each of five anniversary
dates. The issuance of the shares is subject to Board approval and the continuation of sponsored
research at the institution. If the Board does not approve the issuance of the shares, then the
Company will remit $20,000 in cash plus the value of the shares, as defined, to the institution on
each of the anniversary dates of the agreement.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Athersys owns 50.2% of Oculus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Oculus&#148;) related to a 2001 joint venture.
Athersys accounts for its investment in Oculus under the equity method due to significant minority
investor rights (i.e., &#147;substantive participating rights,&#148; as defined by EITF 96-16) retained by
the other investors. In connection with a settlement that occurred in 2003 and a milestone that was
achieved in 2006, Athersys received stock-based proceeds in another privately-held company in the
amount of $200,000 in aggregate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with that same milestone in 2006, Oculus also received stock-based proceeds in the
privately-held company in the amount of $260,000, in addition to $23,000 previously received.
Athersys recognized approximately $117,000 in 2006 as its share of the Oculus net income, after
recapturing prior losses in excess of the Company&#146;s investment in and advances to the joint
venture. Consistent with its wind-up strategy, Oculus will remain in existence as a dormant entity
only as long as it is necessary to serve as a pass through of any further milestone-based
consideration and final distribution to its remaining shareholders. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
2007, Oculus had no significant assets, liabilities, stockholders&#146; equity or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Athersys evaluated its cost-method investment in the equity securities of the privately-held
company that sells laboratory systems to the life sciences industry, and as a result of adverse
changes in market conditions, the fair value of the equity securities is less than the carrying
amount at December&nbsp;31, 2008. The severity of the impairment (fair value is approximately 16% less
than cost) and the duration of the impairment (less than 3&nbsp;months) correlate with the weak market
environment. Based on the Company&#146;s evaluation of the near-term prospects of the investee and its
ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a recovery
of fair value, the Company does not consider the investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired
at December&nbsp;31, 2008.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2007, the Company adopted two incentive plans that authorized an aggregate of 4,500,000 shares
of common stock for awards to employees, directors and consultants. These equity incentive plans
authorize the issuance of equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and units, and
other stock-based awards to qualified employees, directors and consultants.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In May&nbsp;2007, the majority of Old Athersys&#146; pre-Merger outstanding options were terminated. The
Company accounted for the termination of these awards as a settlement and all previously
unrecognized compensation expense ($385,000) was recognized on the termination date in 2007. New
option awards to purchase 3,625,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $5.00 per
share were granted to employees, directors and consultants in June&nbsp;2007 upon the closing of the
Merger. The options that were granted to employees generally vested 40% on the date of grant and
vest ratably over three years. The options granted to non-employees and board members generally
vest at varying percentages over three years.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Prior to the Merger in 2007, Old Athersys maintained equity incentive plans in which 277,000 shares
were available for issuance and 116,083 options were outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2006. Upon the
closing of the Merger, BTHC VI assumed 5,052 of these options, which will be governed by Old
Athersys&#146; original equity plans until the awards expire. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2,473 of these
assumed awards remain outstanding. All of the remaining outstanding option awards under Old
Athersys&#146; former equity incentive plans were terminated prior to the Merger.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, a total of 764,000 shares are available for issuance under the Company&#146;s
equity compensation plans and options to purchase 3,738,473 shares of common stock are outstanding
(including the assumed options covering 2,473 shares described above). The Company recognized
$1,856,000, $5,139,000 and $459,000 of stock compensation expense in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, total unrecognized estimated compensation cost related to
unvested stock options was approximately $3,033,000, which is expected to be recognized by June&nbsp;30,
2012 using the straight-line method.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The weighted average fair value of option shares granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $2.00, $2.82
and $-0- per share, respectively. The total fair value of option shares vested in 2008, 2007 and
2006 was $2,337,000, $4,742,000 and $428,000, respectively. There is no aggregate intrinsic value
of fully vested option shares and option shares expected to vest as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 since the
market value was less than the exercise price of the options at the end of the year.
