<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>MultiStem &#151; A Novel Allogeneic Approach to Stem Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing a proprietary nonembryonic, allogeneic stem cell product candidate, MultiStem,
that we believe has potential utility for treating a broad range of diseases and could have
widespread application in the field of clinical regenerative medicine. Unlike traditional bone
marrow transplants or other stem cell therapies, MultiStem may be manufactured on a large scale
(with hundreds of thousands to millions of doses obtained from a single healthy donor), and may be
administered without tissue matching or the need for immune suppression, analogous to type O blood.
Potential applications of MultiStem include the treatment of cardiovascular disease, neurological
disease or injury, and conditions involving the immune system, including autoimmune disease and
other conditions. We believe that MultiStem represents a significant advancement in the field of
stem cell therapy and could have broad clinical application. We currently have open
Investigational New Drug applications, or INDs, for the study of
MultiStem in four  distinct clinical
indications.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">MultiStem is a patented biologic product that is manufactured from human stem cells obtained from
adult bone marrow. The product consists of a special class of human stem cells that have the
ability to express a range of therapeutically relevant proteins and other factors, as well as form
multiple cell types. Factors expressed by MultiStem have the potential to deliver a therapeutic
benefit in several ways, such as the reduction of inflammation, regulation of immune system
function, protection of damaged or injured tissue, the formation of new blood vessels in regions of
ischemic injury and augmenting tissue repair and healing in other ways. Like drugs, these cells
may be stored for an extended period of time (in frozen form) and used off-the-shelf.  Following administration, the
cells express multiple therapeutically relevant proteins and are subsequently cleared from the body over time.


</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The therapeutic benefit of bone marrow transplantation has been recognized for decades, and its
clinical use has grown since Congress passed the National Organ Transplant Act in 1984 and the
National Marrow Donor Registry was established in 1990. However, widespread bone marrow or stem
cell transplantation has yet to become a reality. Some of the limitations that have prevented
broader clinical application of bone marrow or stem cell transplantation include the requirement
for tissue matching between donor and recipient, the typical need for one donor for each patient (a
reflection of the inability to expand cells in a controlled and reproducible manner), frequent use
of immune suppressive drugs to avoid rejection or immune system complications, the inability to
efficiently produce significant quantities of stem cells, and a range of potential safety issues.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A stem cell therapy that has the potential to address the challenges mentioned above could
represent a breakthrough in the field of regenerative medicine, since it could greatly expand the
clinical application of stem cell therapy or other forms of regenerative medicine. In 2003, we
acquired technology originally developed at the University of Minnesota related to a novel stem
cell, the Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cell, or MAPC, which may be isolated from adult bone marrow
as well as other nonembryonic tissues. Over the past several years, we have further developed this
technology and the manufacturing of these cells for use in ongoing clinical trials. Our current
product platform is referred to as MultiStem. During several years of preclinical work, MultiStem
has demonstrated the potential to address many of the fundamental limitations observed with traditional
bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplants.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe that MultiStem represents a potential best-in-class stem cell therapy because it
exhibits each of the following characteristics based on research and development to date:

    <TD><I>Broad plasticity and multiple potential mechanisms of action.</I>
MultiStem cells have a demonstrated ability in animal models to form a
range of cell types and also appear to be able to deliver therapeutic

diseases, autoimmune disease, transplant support (including in oncology patients), and a range of
orphan disease indications. As a result, we believe we will be able to leverage our foundation of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with independent investigators at a number of leading institutions, such as the University
of Minnesota, the Cleveland Clinic, the National Institutes of Health, the Medical College of
Georgia, the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center and the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, we
have studied MultiStem in a range of <I>in vitro</I> and preclinical animal models that reflect various
types of human disease or injury in the cardiovascular, neurological and immunological areas. To
date, we have published research results illustrating the potential benefits of MultiStem in a
range of indications including myocardial infarction, vascular disease, ischemic stroke, traumatic
brain injury, brain damage due to restricted blood flow in newborns, spinal cord injury, and bone
marrow transplant support/GVHD. In addition, we have explored and intend to further explore, the
potential application of MultiStem in the treatment of a range of other conditions, including other
forms of cardiovascular disease, neurological conditions, and immune related disorders.

Disease &#151; Evaluating MultiStem for Heart Attack</I></B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In a Phase I clinical trial, we have been exploring the use of MultiStem as a treatment for damage
caused by myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Myocardial infarction is one of the leading
causes of death and disability in the United States. Myocardial infarction is caused by the
blockage of one or more arteries that supply blood to the heart. Such blockages can be caused, for
example, by the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque deposit. According to the American Heart
Association 2010 Statistical Update, there were approximately 935,000 cases of myocardial
infarction that occurred in the United States in 2006 and approximately 8.5&nbsp;million individuals
living in the United States that had previously suffered a heart attack. In addition, there were
more than 831,000 deaths that occurred from various forms of cardiovascular disease, including
567,000 individuals that died as a result of a myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure. A
variety of risk factors are associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction or
atherosclerosis, including age, high blood pressure, smoking, sedentary lifestyle and genetics.
While advances in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of heart disease have had a positive
impact, there is clearly room for improvement &#151; myocardial infarction remains a leading cause of
death and disability in the United States and the rest of the world.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">MultiStem has been studied in validated animal models of AMI, including at both the Cleveland
Clinic and the University of Minnesota. Investigators demonstrated that the administration of
allogeneic MultiStem into the hearts of animals damaged by experimentally induced heart attacks
resulted in significant functional improvement in cardiac output and other functional parameters
compared with animals that received placebo or no treatment. Furthermore, the administration of
immunosuppressive drug was not required and provided no additional benefit in this study, and
supports the concept of using MultiStem as an allogeneic product.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with a contract research organization, we completed additional preclinical studies in
established pig models of AMI using catheter delivery and examining various factors such as the
route and method of MultiStem administration, dose ranging, and timing of treatment. In 2008, we
initiated a multicenter, open-label Phase I clinical trial in this indication and we completed
enrollment in 2010. In July&nbsp;2010, we announced the interim results from this trial, which showed
that MultiStem was well tolerated at all dose levels and exhibited a favorable safety profile.  In addition, patients that
received treatment with MultiStem exhibited meaningful improvements in cardiovascular function, including left ventricular
ejection fraction, wall motion scores, and other parameters.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing MultiStem for this indication in conjunction with our partner, Angiotech. We
entered into a product co-development collaboration with Angiotech in 2006 for the potential
application of MultiStem in multiple
cardiovascular indications including myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and certain
other indications. Based on the results from the preclinical studies and Phase I clinical trial results, we intend to initiate a
Phase II clinical trial involving administration of MultiStem to AMI patients in 2011.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B><I>Immunological Disorders &#151; MultiStem for IBD and HSC Transplant Support </I></B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In multiple studies, MultiStem has shown potent immunomodulatory properties, including the ability
to reduce active inflammation and immune system imbalance. Accordingly, we believe that MultiStem
could have broad application in the area of treating immune system disorders, including certain
autoimmune diseases and other conditions, including GVHD, which is a frequent immunological
complication associated with bone marrow or HSC transplantation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to develop and commercialize
MutiStem for the treatment of IBD for the worldwide market. IBD is a group of inflammatory and
autoimmune conditions that affect the colon and small intestine, typically resulting in severe
abdominal pain, weight loss, vomiting and diarrhea. The most common forms of the disease include
ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#146;s disease, which are estimated to affect more than 2.3&nbsp;million people
in the United States, five major European markets (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and
Spain) and Japan. Chronic IBD can be a severely debilitating condition, and advanced cases may
require surgery to remove the affected region of the bowel, and may also require temporary or
permanent colostomy or iliostomy. In many cases, surgery does not achieve a permanent cure, and
patients suffer a return of the disease. Enrollment commenced in February&nbsp;2011 in our Phase II
clinical study being conducted with our partner, Pfizer, to administer MultiStem to patients
suffering from ulcerative colitis.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Another area of focus is the use of MultiStem as adjunctive treatment for HSC/bone marrow
transplant used as therapy in hematologic malignancy. For many types of cancer, such as leukemia or
other blood-borne cancers, treatment typically involves radiation therapy or chemotherapy, alone or
in combination. Such treatment can substantially deplete the cells of the blood and immune system,
by reducing the number of stem cells in the bone marrow from which they arise. The more intense the
radiation treatment or chemotherapy, the more severe the resulting depletion is of the bone marrow,
blood, and immune system. Other tissues may also be affected, such as cells in the digestive tract
and in the pulmonary system. The result may be severe anemia, immunodeficiency, substantial
reduction in digestive capacity, and other problems that may result in significant disability or
death.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">One strategy for treating the depletion of bone marrow is to perform a peripheral blood stem cell
transplant or a bone marrow transplant. This approach may augment the patient&#146;s ability to form new
blood and immune cells and provide a significant survival advantage. However, finding a closely
matched donor is frequently difficult or even impossible. Even when such a donor is found, in many
cases there are immunological complications, such as GVHD, which may result in serious disability
or death.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Working with leading experts in the stem cell and bone marrow transplantation field, we have
studied MultiStem in animal models of radiation therapy and GVHD. In multiple animal models,
MultiStem has been shown to be non-immunogenic, even when administered without the genetic matching
that is typically required for conventional bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Furthermore,
in animal model systems testing immune reactivity of T-cells against unrelated donor tissue,
MultiStem has been shown to suppress the T-cell-mediated immune responses that are an important
factor in causing GVHD. MultiStem-treated animals also displayed a significant increase in survival
relative to controls. As a result, we believe that the administration of MultiStem in conjunction
with or following standard HSC transplantation may have the potential to reduce the incidence or
severity of complications and may enhance gastrointestinal function which is frequently compromised
as a result of radiation treatment or chemotherapy.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2008, we initiated a Phase I clinical trial to examine the safety and tolerability of MultiStem
in patients receiving a bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplant related to their
treatment for hematologic malignancy. The trial is an open label, multicenter trial that involves
leading experts in the field of bone marrow transplantation. In January&nbsp;2011, we announced that we
had successfully completed enrollment for the single ascending dose portion of this clinical trial
and established the maximum tolerated dose, and we expect to announce preliminary results in the
second quarter of 2011. In addition, the multiple ascending dose portion of this study is ongoing.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Another focus of our regenerative medicine program is the use of MultiStem for the treatment of
neurological injury
as a result of ischemic stroke or other conditions. To date, we have published research with
independent collaborating investigators that demonstrates that MultiStem conveys biological
benefits in preclinical models of ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, neonatal hypoxic
ischemia (a leading cause of cerebral palsy), and spinal cord injury. We have also conducted
preclinical work in other neurological areas, and have been awarded grants to support work in areas
such as the indications described above and for evaluating the potential of MultiStem to treat
Parkinson&#146;s Disease. Research has shown that MultiStem conveys benefits through multiple distinct
mechanisms, including reducing inflammatory damage, protecting at risk tissue at the site of
injury, and through direct neurotrophic effects. As a result, we believe that MultiStem may have
relevance to multiple forms of neurological injury and disease.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our initial clinical focus in the neurological area involves evaluating administration of MultiStem
to treat ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability globally, and
accounts for approximately 85% of all strokes. Recent progress toward the development of safer and
more effective treatments for ischemic stroke has been disappointing. Despite the fact that
ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States,
affecting more than 700,000 new patients annually according to the United States Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, there has been little progress toward the development of
treatments that improve the prognosis for stroke victims. The only FDA-approved drug currently
available for ischemic stroke is the anti-clotting factor, tPA. According to current clinical
guidelines, tPA must be administered to stroke patients within three hours after the occurrence of
the ischemic stroke to remove the clot while minimizing potential risks, such as bleeding into the
brain. Administration of tPA after this time frame is not recommended, since it can cause bleeding
or even death. Given this limited therapeutic window, it is estimated that less than 5% of ischemic
stroke victims currently receive treatment with tPA.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In preclinical studies conducted by investigators, including at both the University of Minnesota
and the Medical College of Georgia, significant functional improvements have been observed in
rodents that have undergone an experimentally induced stroke, or that have incurred significant
neurological damage as a result of neonatal hypoxic ischemia, and then received treatment with
MultiStem. Published research has demonstrated that administration of MultiStem even one week after
a surgically induced stroke results in substantial long-term therapeutic benefit, as evidenced by
the improvement of treated animals compared with controls in a battery of tests examining mobility,
strength, fine motor skills, and other aspects of neurological functional improvement. We believe
that this benefit is achieved through several mechanisms, including reduction of inflammation and
immune system modulation in the ischemic area, and the protection and rescue of damaged or injured
cells, including neuronal tissue. More recent research results, presented at the 2011 American
Heart Association International Stroke Conference by collaborators from the University of Texas
Health Science Center at Houston, demonstrated that administration of MultiStem 24 hours following
a stroke reduced inflammatory damage in the brain, and resulted in significant functional
improvement, and that some of these results were achieved by reducing the inflammatory response
emanating from the spleen. These results confirm that MultiStem treatment is well tolerated, does
not require immunosuppression, and results in a robust and durable therapeutic benefit even when
administered up to one week after the initial stroke event.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In 2008, we completed additional preclinical safety studies and submitted an IND for this
application, which has been authorized by the FDA. The Phase I safety clinical trial authorized by
the FDA is a double blind, placebo controlled study that allows for administration of MultiStem to
patients 48 to 60 hours after the ischemic stroke, which, if shown to be safe and effective, would
represent a significant extension of the treatment window relative to existing standard of care.
However, since this study was authorized, we have generated additional preclinical and clinical
data that demonstrates the consistent safety profile of MultiStem. Accordingly, we are focused on
modifying the design of this study, including increasing the trial size, so that we can evaluate
clinical safety and efficacy in a more robust manner.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Novel 5HT2c agonists for the treatment of obesity and related conditions</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Obesity is a substantial contributing factor to a range of diseases that represent the major causes
of death and disability in the developed world today. Individuals that are clinically obese have
elevated rates of cardiovascular disease, stroke, certain types of cancer and diabetes. According
to the CDC, the incidence of obesity in the United
States has increased at an epidemic rate during the past 20&nbsp;years. CDC now estimates that 66% of
all Americans are overweight, including more than 30% that are considered clinically obese. The
percentage of young people who are overweight has more than tripled since 1980. There has also been
a dramatic rise in the rate of obesity in Europe and Asia. Despite the magnitude of this problem,
current approaches to clinical obesity are largely ineffective, and we are aware of relatively few
new therapeutic approaches in clinical development.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are developing novel pharmaceutical treatments for obesity, which are compounds designed to act
by stimulating a key receptor in the brain that regulates appetite and food intake &#151; the 5HT2c
receptor. The role of this receptor in regulating food intake is well understood in both animal
models and humans. In 1996, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals launched the anti-obesity drug Redux<SUP style="FONT-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
(dexfenfluramine), a non-specific serotonin receptor agonist that was used with the stimulant
phentermine in a combination commonly known as fen-phen. This diet drug combination gained rapid
and widespread acceptance in the clinical marketplace and was shown to be highly effective at
regulating appetite, reducing food intake, and causing significant weight loss. Unfortunately, in
addition to stimulating the 5HT2c receptor, Redux also stimulated the 5HT2b receptor that is found
in the heart. The activation of 5HT2b by Redux is believed to have caused significant
cardiovascular problems in a number of patients and, as a result, Redux was withdrawn from the
market in 1997. In 1996, doctors wrote 18&nbsp;million monthly prescriptions for drugs constituting the
fen/phen combination. In that same year, these drugs generated sales of greater than $400&nbsp;million,
serving as a benchmark for the substantial market opportunity for an effective drug to treat
clinical obesity.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since the withdrawal of Redux from the
market, several groups have published research and clinical data that implicate stimulation of
the 5HT2b receptor as the underlying cause of the cardiovascular problems. These findings suggest
that highly selective compounds that stimulate the 5HT2c receptor, but that do not appreciably
stimulate the 5HT2b receptor, could be developed that maintain the desired appetite suppressive
effects without the cardiovascular toxicity. Recent clinical data supports this hypothesis and
also suggests that the 5HT2c agonists may also cause a statistically significant reduction in
HbA1c and fasting glucose levels, clinically relevant measures for patients suffering from
diabetes.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We initiated a drug development program focused on creating potent and selective compounds that
stimulate the 5HT2c receptor, but that avoid the 5HT2b receptor and other receptors, such as 5HT2a.
Our specific goal has been to develop an orally administered pill that reduces appetite by
stimulating the 5HT2c receptor, but that does not stimulate the 5HT2b receptor, the 5HT2a receptor,
or other receptors that could cause adverse side effects. Based on extensive preclinical studies
that we have conducted with compounds that we have generated, we have demonstrated the ability to
develop compounds that are highly potent and selective for the 5HT2c receptor,
and that lack activity at either 5HT2a or 5HT2b. We believe that this achievement represents a
significant advance in the field, and that the potency and selectivity profile displayed by
compounds we are developing will result in substantially better efficacy and a cleaner safety and
tolerability profile in clinical trials, as well as a more convenient dosing schedule than other
5HT2c agonist programs. Our goal is to select a clinical candidate for this program in 2011.

between our small molecule programs capabilities and our MultiStem technology. Specifically, we believe that
substantial opportunities exist for
identifying small molecule modulators of therapeutically relevant biological activity exhibited by
MultiStem or other stem cell types. We believe that applying our capabilities in both areas could
lead to next generation product development opportunities, including more potent stem cell based
therapies that have been optimized for use in specific indication areas.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to our current product development programs, we developed our patented RAGE technology
that provides us with the ability to produce human cell lines that express specific, biologically
well validated drug targets without relying upon cloned and isolated gene sequences. While our RAGE
technology is not a product, it is a commercial technology that we have successfully applied for
the benefit of our partners and that we have also used for our own internal drug development
programs. Modern drug screening approaches typically require the physical isolation and structural
modification of a gene of interest, an approach referred to as gene cloning, in order to create a
cell line that expresses a drug target of interest. Researchers may then use the genetically
modified cell line to identify pharmaceutical compounds that inhibit or stimulate the target of
interest. The RAGE technology enables us to turn on or amplify the expression of a drug target
without having to physically clone or isolate the gene. In effect, the technology works through the
random insertion of tiny, proprietary genetic switches that randomly turn genes on without
requiring their physical isolation, or any advance knowledge of their structure. This technology
provides us with broad freedom to work with targets that may be otherwise unavailable as a result
of intellectual property restrictions on the use of specific cloned and isolated genes. Over the
past several years, we have produced cell lines that express drug targets in a range of disease
areas such as metabolic disease, infectious disease, oncology, cardiovascular disease,
inflammation, and central nervous system disorders. Many of these were produced for drug
development programs at major pharmaceutical companies that we have collaborated with, such as
Bristol-Myers Squibb, and some have been produced for our internal drug development programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In the fourth quarter of 2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to develop and
commercialize MultiStem for the treatment of IBD for the worldwide market. Under the terms of the
agreement, we received a non-refundable up-front cash payment of $6&nbsp;million from Pfizer and will
receive research funding and support during the initial phase of the collaboration. In addition,
we are also eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $105&nbsp;million upon the successful
achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, though there can be no
assurance that we will achieve any milestones, and no milestones were received as of December&nbsp;31,
2010. We will be responsible for manufacturing and Pfizer will pay us for manufacturing product
for clinical development and commercialization purposes. Pfizer will have responsibility for
development, regulatory and commercialization and will pay us tiered royalties on worldwide
commercial sales of MultiStem IBD products. Alternatively, in lieu of royalties and certain
commercialization milestones, we may elect to co-develop with Pfizer and the parties will share
development and commercialization expenses and profits/losses on an agreed basis beginning at Phase
III clinical development.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Pfizer collaboration does not have a specific termination date, but will
terminate upon the last to expire royalty term, unless terminated earlier by
either party. Either party can terminate the agreement for an uncured material
breach or default. Pfizer is permitted to terminate the agreement upon advance
written notice to us if we sustain certain turnover levels for employees
working on the program, if our license with the University of Minnesota is
terminated, if we experience a specified change of control event, or in its
sole discretion. We can terminate the agreement if a certain milestone event
has not occurred by a defined period of time, or if we reasonably believe that
Pfizer has failed to satisfy its obligations to progress the development of the
program. Following termination of the agreement by us, all licenses granted to
Pfizer to develop and commercialize MultiStem for IBD will terminate, other
than certain more limited research licenses, and ownership of regulatory and
clinical data will revert to us. Following termination of the agreement by
Pfizer, the licenses granted to Pfizer will remain in effect according to their
terms, unless the termination is due to our breach, employee turnover or
termination of the license with University of Minnesota, in which case payments
to us will be reduced from what was otherwise payable. Also, if Pfizer
terminates in its sole discretion, then Pfizer retains its obligation to fund
our research and development costs as set forth in the agreement.

MultiStem for the treatment of damage caused by myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular
disease. In support of the collaboration, Angiotech invested $10.0&nbsp;million in us and we may also
receive up to $3.75&nbsp;million of additional equity investments and $63.75&nbsp;million of aggregate cash
payments based upon the successful achievement of specified clinical development and
commercialization milestones, though there can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones.
To date, other than the initial investment of $10.0&nbsp;million in the Company by Angiotech in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the terms of the collaboration, the parties are jointly funding clinical development
activities, whereby preclinical costs are borne solely by Athersys, costs for Phase I and Phase II
clinical trials are borne 50% by Athersys and 50% by Angiotech, costs for the first Phase III
clinical trial will be borne 33% by Athersys and 67% by Angiotech, and costs for any Phase III
clinical trials subsequent to the first Phase III clinical trial will be borne 25% by Athersys and
75% by Angiotech. We have received $2.4&nbsp;million from Angiotech as its cumulative share of clinical
development cost reimbursements, representing billings through
September 30, 2010. We have lead
responsibility for preclinical and early clinical development and manufacturing of the MultiStem
product, and Angiotech will take the lead on pivotal and later clinical trials and
commercialization. We will receive nearly half of the net profits from the sale of any jointly
developed, approved products. In addition, we will retain the commercial rights to MultiStem for
all other therapeutic applications, including treatment of stroke or other neurological
indications, bone marrow transplantation and oncology support, blood and immune system disorders,
autoimmune disease, and other indications that we may elect to pursue.

and may be licensed to Angiotech under the collaboration.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Neither we nor Angiotech may terminate the collaboration at will; however, either party may elect
at certain points to not move forward with individual product development programs. If either party
breaches its material obligations and fails to cure that breach within 60&nbsp;days after notice from
the non-breaching party, the non-breaching party may terminate the collaboration. Angiotech has a
right to immediately terminate the collaboration upon certain bankruptcy events involving us.
Angiotech also has the right to terminate the collaboration upon 120&nbsp;days&#146; prior notice if
Angiotech, in its reasonable judgment, determines that: (1)&nbsp;a primary endpoint in a clinical trial
within a clinical development plan has not been met; (2)&nbsp;the clinical efficacy and/or safety with

In the event that Angiotech elects not to continue with our collaboration, Angiotech would return all rights to
us and we would have an outstanding claim related to Angiotech&#146;s reimbursement of our fourth quarter 2010
collaboration costs and the costs through January 28, 2011, which was Angiotech&#146;s petition date.
In the event that Angiotech fails to fund its obligations under the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2000, we entered into a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to provide cell lines
expressing well validated drug targets produced using our RAGE technology for compound screening
and development. This initial collaboration was expanded in 2002 and again in 2006, and is now in
its final phase as amended in 2009. Bristol-Myers Squibb uses the cell lines in its internal drug
development programs and, in exchange, we receive license fee and milestone payments and will be
entitled to receive royalties on the sale of any approved products. Depending on the use of a cell
line by Bristol-Myers Squibb and the progress of drug development programs benefiting from the use
of such a cell line, we may receive as much as approximately $5.5&nbsp;million per cell line in
additional license fees and milestone payments, though we cannot assure you that any further
milestones will be achieved or that we will receive any additional milestone payments. In
September&nbsp;2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb successfully advanced into Phase II clinical development a
drug candidate discovered using a target provided by us, thereby triggering a clinical development
milestone payment to us.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since the beginning of the collaboration, we have provided 27 cell lines to Bristol-Myers

Squibb, as well as milestone payments and royalties on compounds developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb
using our technology.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The Bristol-Myers Squibb collaboration does not have a specific termination date, but will
terminate when Bristol-Myers Squibb no longer has an obligation to pay us royalties, which

expect Bristol-Myers Squibb to file for and be issued patents for products developed under the
collaboration, we are not aware of any patents issued to Bristol-Myers Squibb covering any
potential products related to the collaboration. If either party breaches its material obligations

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We face significant competition with respect to the various dimensions of our business. With regard
to our efforts to develop MultiStem as a novel stem cell therapy, currently, there are a number of
companies that are actively developing stem cell products, which encompass a range of different
cell types, including embryonic stem cells, umbilical cord stem cells, adult-derived stem cells,
and processed bone marrow derived cells.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Osiris is currently engaged in multiple Phase II and Phase III clinical trials involving Prochymal,
an allogeneic stem cell product based on mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs, that are obtained from
healthy consenting donors, and are administered without tissue matching. However, in contrast to
MultiStem, MSCs display limited expansion potential and more limited biological plasticity. In
November&nbsp;2008, Osiris announced a partnership in which Genzyme acquired development rights to
Prochymal for certain markets outside the United States and Canada in exchange for $130&nbsp;million in
license fees, up to $1.25&nbsp;billion in clinical and sales milestones, and royalties. Osiris

an allogeneic stem cell product based on mesenchymal stem cell precursors that are obtained from
healthy consenting donors. These cells also appear to display limited expansion potential and more
limited biological plasticity. In December&nbsp;2010, Mesoblast announced a partnership with Cephalon,
in which Cephalon paid an upfront license fee of $130&nbsp;million, and agreed to invest an additional
$220&nbsp;million in equity for a 19.9% stake in the company. In addition, total regulatory milestone
payments to Mesoblast could reach $1.7&nbsp;billion, assuming that the agreement results in commercial
treatments for conditions including congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction,
Parkinson&#146;s disease, and Alzheimer&#146;s disease.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Other public companies are developing stem-related therapies, including Geron, Aastrom Biosciences,
Stem Cells Inc., Johnson &#038; Johnson, Celgene, Advanced Cell Technology, CRYO-CELL International,
Pluristem and Cytori Therapeutics. In addition, private companies, such as Cognate Therapeutics,
Gamida Cell, Plureon, Cellerix and others, are also developing cell therapy related products or
capabilities. Given the magnitude of the potential opportunity for stem cell therapy, we expect
competition in this area to intensify in the coming years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We also face competition in our efforts to develop compounds for the treatment of obesity. There is
currently one approved therapeutic product on the market for obesity, Xenical (also known as Alli),
which is marketed by Roche. Potential side effects associated with taking Xenical / Alli include
cramping, intestinal discomfort, flatulence, diarrhea, and leakage of oily stool. Another obesity
drug, Meridia, was approved for clinical use and marketed by Abbott Pharmaceuticals, but was
recently withdrawn from the market due to concerns regarding increased risk of cardiovascular
disease and stroke among patients taking the drug.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">There are many other companies attempting to develop novel treatments for obesity, and a wide range
of approaches are being taken. Some of these companies include large, multinational pharmaceutical
companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Roche, Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly
and others. There are also a variety of biotechnology companies developing treatments for obesity,
including Arena Pharmaceuticals, Orexigen, Vivus, Neurosearch, Amgen, Regeneron, Nastech
Pharmaceutical Company, Alizyme, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Neurocrine Biosciences, Shionogi,
Metabolic Pharmaceuticals, Kyorin Pharmaceutical, and others. It is likely that, given the
magnitude of the market opportunity, many companies will continue to focus on the obesity area, and
that competition will remain high. If we are successful at developing a 5HT2c agonist as a safe and
effective treatment for obesity, it is likely that other companies will attempt to develop safer
and more effective compounds in the same class, or will attempt to combine therapies in an effort
to establish a safer and more effective therapeutic product.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We believe our most significant competitors are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and
biotechnology companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and
human resources than we do. These companies may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for
competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. In addition, our competitors may
develop technologies and products that are cheaper, safer or more effective than those being
developed by us or that would render our technology obsolete. Furthermore, some of these companies
may feel threatened by our activities and attempt to delay or impede our efforts to develop our
products or apply our technologies.

obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others to continue to commercialize our
products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or
proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain
rights to the third party&#146;s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby
giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Preclinical studies can take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based
on those studies will become effective to permit clinical trials to
begin. The clinical development phase generally takes five to seven
years, or longer, to complete (i.e., from the initiation of Phase 1
through completion of Phase 3 studies). After successful completion of
clinical trials for  a new drug or biologic product, FDA approval of the NDA or BLA must be obtained.
This process requires substantial time and effort and there is no assurance that the FDA will
accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that the FDA will grant approval. In the past,
the FDA&#146;s approval of an NDA or BLA has taken, on average, one to two years, but in some instances
may take substantially longer. If questions regarding safety or efficacy arise, additional studies
may be required, followed by a resubmission of the NDA or BLA. Review and approval of an NDA or BLA
can take up to several years.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each drug manufacturing facility must be
inspected and approved by the FDA. All manufacturing establishments are subject to inspections by
the FDA and by other federal, state, and local agencies, and must comply with GMP requirements. We
do not currently have any GMP manufacturing capabilities, and will rely on contract manufacturers
to produce material for any clinical trials that we may conduct.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We must also obtain regulatory approval in other countries in which we intend to market any drug.
The requirements governing conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and
reimbursement vary widely from country to country. FDA approval does not ensure regulatory approval
in other countries. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent
in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In some countries, the sale price
of the drug must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is
granted. Even if a foreign regulatory authority approves a drug product, it may not approve
satisfactory prices for the product.

financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our equity securities could
decline. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business, financial condition and

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We have incurred losses since inception and we expect to incur significant net losses in the
foreseeable future and may never become profitable.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since our inception in 1995, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from
operations. We have incurred net losses of $18&nbsp;million in 2008, $15&nbsp;million in 2009 and $11&nbsp;million
in 2010. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had an accumulated deficit of $205&nbsp;million, and anticipate
incurring additional losses for at least the next several years. We expect to spend significant
resources over the next several years to enhance our technologies and to fund research and
development of our pipeline of potential products. To date, substantially all of Athersys&#146; revenue
has been derived from corporate collaborations, license agreements and government grants. In order
to achieve profitability, we must develop products and technologies that can be commercialized by
us or through future collaborations. Our ability to generate revenues and become profitable will
depend on our ability, alone or with potential collaborators, to timely, efficiently and
successfully complete the development of our product candidates. We have never earned revenue from
selling a product and we may never do so, as none of our product candidates have been approved for
sale, since they are currently being tested yet in humans and animal studies. We cannot assure you
that we will ever earn revenue or that we will ever become profitable. If we sustain losses over an
extended period of time, we may be unable to continue our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We will need substantial additional funding to develop our products and for our future operations.
If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to do so, we may be required to delay, scale back or
eliminate our product development activities or may be unable to continue our business.</I></B>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The development of our product candidates will require a commitment of substantial funds to conduct
the costly and time-consuming research, which may include preclinical and clinical testing,
necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and bring our products to market. Net cash used in our
operations was $16&nbsp;million in 2008, $5&nbsp;million in 2009 and $11&nbsp;million in 2010. We expect to have
available cash to fund our operations through 2011 based on our current business and operational
plans and assuming no new financings or collaborations. Our future capital requirements will
depend on many factors, including:

will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our future operations. We cannot be
certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. In recent years,
it has been difficult for companies to raise capital due to a variety of factors, which may or may
not continue. To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, the
ownership position of our existing stockholders could be substantially diluted. If additional funds
are raised through the issuance of preferred stock or debt securities, these securities are likely
to have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. Fluctuating interest rates

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Success in preclinical studies or completed clinical trials does not ensure that later studies or
trials, including continuing non-clinical studies and large-scale clinical trials, will be
successful nor does it necessarily predict future results. The rate of failure in drug development
is quite high, and many companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered
significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials.
Product candidates may fail to show desired safety and efficacy in larger and more diverse patient
populations in later stage clinical trials, despite having progressed through early stage trials.
Negative or inconclusive results from any of our ongoing preclinical studies or clinical trials
could result in delays, modifications, or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials and the
termination of our development of a product candidate. Additionally, even if we are able to
successfully complete pivotal Phase III clinical trials, the FDA still may not approve our product
candidates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Our product candidates are in an early stage of development and we currently have no therapeutic
products approved for sale. If we are unable to develop, obtain regulatory approval or market any
of our product candidates, our financial condition will be negatively affected, and we may have to

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are in the early stage of product development, and we are dependent on the application of our
technologies to discover or develop therapeutic product candidates. We currently do not sell any
approved therapeutic products and do not expect to have any products commercially available for
several years, if at all. You must evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities
affecting an early stage biotechnology company. Our product candidates require additional research
and development, preclinical testing, clinical testing and regulatory review and/or approvals or
clearances before marketing. To date, no one to our knowledge has commercialized any therapeutic
products using our technologies and we might never commercialize any product using our technologies
and strategy.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, we may not succeed in developing new product candidates as an alternative to our
existing portfolio of product candidates. If our current product candidates are delayed or fail, or
we fail to successfully develop and commercialize new product candidates, our financial condition
may be negatively affected, and we may have to curtail or cease our operations.

establish new ones, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our
product candidates.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A key element of our business strategy is to commercialize some of our product candidates through
collaborations with other companies. Our strategy includes establishing collaborations and
licensing agreements with one or more pharmaceutical, biotechnology or device companies, preferably
after we have advanced product candidates through the initial stages of clinical development.
However, we may not be able to establish or maintain such licensing and collaboration arrangements
necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Even if we are able to maintain or
establish licensing or collaboration arrangements, these arrangements may not be on favorable terms
and may contain provisions that will restrict our ability to develop, test and market our product
candidates. Any failure to maintain or establish licensing or collaboration arrangements on
favorable terms could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition or ability to
develop and commercialize our product candidates.

regarding the rights and obligations of the parties. These and other possible disagreements could
lead to termination of the
agreement or delays in collaborative research, development, supply, or commercialization of certain
product candidates, or could require or result in litigation or arbitration. Moreover,
disagreements could arise with our collaborators over rights to intellectual property or our rights
to share in any of the future revenues of products developed by our collaborators. These kinds of
disagreements could result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Any such conflicts with our
collaborators could reduce our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and could have a
negative impact on our relationship with existing collaborators.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Currently, our material collaborations and licensing arrangements are our collaboration with Pfizer
to develop and commercialize MultiStem for the treatment of IBD, our product co-development
collaboration with Angiotech to jointly develop and ultimately market MultiStem for the treatment
of damage caused by myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease, our collaboration
agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb pursuant to which we provide cell lines produced using our RAGE
technology, our collaboration with RTI to develop and commercialize MAPC technology-based biologic
implants for certain orthopedic applications in the bone graft substitutes market, and our license

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our success depends on the performance by our collaborators of their responsibilities under our
collaboration arrangements. Some potential collaborators may not perform their obligations in a
timely fashion or in a manner satisfactory to us. Typically, we cannot control the amount of
resources or time our collaborators may devote to our programs or potential products that may be
developed in collaboration with us. We are currently involved in multiple research and development
collaborations with academic and research institutions. These collaborators frequently depend on
outside sources of funding to conduct or complete research and development, such as grants or other
awards. In addition, our academic collaborators may depend on graduate students, medical students,
or research assistants to conduct certain work, and such individuals may not be fully trained or
experienced in certain areas, or they may elect to discontinue their participation in a particular
research program, creating an inability to complete ongoing research in a timely and efficient
manner. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to control the precise timing and
execution of any experiments that may be conducted.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Additionally, our current or future corporate collaborators will retain the ability to pursue other
research, product development or commercial opportunities that may be directly competitive with our
programs. If these collaborators elect to prioritize or pursue other programs in lieu of ours, we
may not be able to advance product development programs in an efficient or effective manner, if at
all. If a collaborator is pursuing a competitive program and encounters unexpected financial or
capability limitations, they may be motivated to reduce the priority placed on our programs or
delay certain activities related to our programs or be unwilling to properly fund their share of
the development expenses for our programs. Any of these developments could harm our product and
technology development efforts, which could seriously harm our business.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Under the terms of our collaboration agreement with Angiotech, either party may choose, following
the completion of Phase I trials, to opt-out of its obligation to fund further product development
on a product-by-product basis, provided no clinical trials concerning such product candidate are
currently ongoing. If Angiotech should decide to opt-out of funding the development of any of the
product candidates for the covered indications, for any reason, we may be unable to fund the
development on our own and could be forced to halt one or more MultiStem development programs. In
January&nbsp;2011, Angiotech announced its plans to pursue a recapitalization transaction through its
voluntary filing under the Companies&#146; Creditors Arrangement Act in Canada.
In the event that Angiotech elects not to continue with our collaboration, Angiotech would return all rights to us and we
would have an outstanding claim related to Angiotech&#146;s reimbursement of our fourth quarter 2010 collaboration costs and the
costs through January 28, 2011, which was Angiotech&#146;s petition date.
In the event that
Angiotech fails to fund its obligations under the terms of our collaboration agreement, our net
costs for subsequent AMI clinical trials would increase or alternative funding would be required
for such clinical trials.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to the regulatory requirements for our pharmaceutical programs, we will also require
regulatory approvals for each distinct application of our stem cell product. In each case, we will
be required to conduct clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of MultiStem, or various
products that incorporate or use MultiStem. For product candidates that advance to clinical
testing, we cannot be certain that we or a collaborator will successfully complete the clinical
trials necessary to receive regulatory product approvals. This process is lengthy and expensive.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We intend to seek approval for our product candidates through the FDA approval process. To obtain
regulatory approvals, we must, among other requirements, complete clinical trials showing that our
products are safe and effective for a particular indication. Under the approval process, we must
submit clinical and non-clinical data to demonstrate the medication is safe and effective. For
example, we must be able to provide data and information, which may include extended pharmacology,
toxicology, reproductive toxicology, bioavailability and genotoxicity studies to establish
suitability for Phase II or large scale Phase III clinical trials.

particular product candidate or program. The FDA or other regulatory agencies may require extensive
clinical trials or other testing prior to granting approval, which could be costly and time
consuming to conduct. Any of these developments would hinder, and potentially prohibit, our ability

treatment of persistent or chronic conditions, such as obesity, are likely to require extensive
follow-up studies and close monitoring of patients after regulatory approval has been granted, for
any signs of adverse effects that occur over a long period of time. These studies may be expensive
and time consuming to conduct and may reveal side effects or other harmful effects in patients that
use our therapeutic products after they are on the market, which may result in the limitation or
withdrawal of our drugs from the market.
Alternatively, we may not be able to conduct such additional trials, which might force us to
abandon our efforts to develop or commercialize certain product candidates. Even if post-approval
studies are not requested or required, after our products are approved and on the market, there

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. Therefore, to commercialize our
product candidates, if and when such products have been approved and are ready for marketing, we
expect to collaborate with third parties to perform these functions. We will either need to share
the value generated from the sale of any products and/or pay a fee to the contract sales
organization. If we establish any such relationships, we will be dependent upon the capabilities of
our collaborators or contract service providers to effectively market, sell, and distribute our
product. If they are ineffective at selling and distributing our product, or if they choose to
emphasize other products over ours, we may not achieve the level of product sales revenues that we
would like. If conflicts arise, we may not be able to resolve them easily or effectively, and we
may suffer financially as a result. If we cannot rely on the sales, marketing and distribution
capabilities of our collaborators or of contract service providers,
we may be forced to establish our own capabilities. We have no experience in developing, training
or managing a sales force and will incur substantial additional expenses if we decide to market any
of our future products directly. Developing a marketing and sales force is also time consuming and
could delay launch of our future products. In addition, we will compete with many companies that
currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Our marketing and sales
efforts may be unable to compete successfully against these companies.

patentability of compounds and methods for using them for which we seek patent protection. We
cannot predict the breadth of claims that will ultimately be allowed in our patent applications, if
any, including those we have in-licensed or the extent to which we may enforce these claims against
our competitors. We have filed multiple patent applications that seek to protect the composition of
matter and method of use related to our small molecule programs. In addition, we are prosecuting
numerous distinct patent families directed to composition, methods of production, and methods of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, patent law outside the United States is uncertain and in many countries intellectual
property laws are undergoing review and revision. The laws of some countries do not protect
intellectual property rights to the same extent as domestic laws. It may be necessary or useful for
us to participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of our competitors&#146; patents
or to defend the validity of any of our or our licensor&#146;s future patents, which could result in
substantial costs and would divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.
With respect to certain of our inventions, we have decided not to pursue patent protection outside
the United States, both because we do not believe it is cost effective and because of
confidentiality concerns. Accordingly, our international competitors could develop and receive
foreign patent protection for gene sequences and functions for which we are seeking United States
patent protection, enabling them to sell products that we have developed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Technologies licensed to us by others, or in-licensed technologies, are important to our business.
The scope of our rights under our licenses may be subject to dispute by our licensors or third
parties. Our rights to use these technologies and to practice the inventions claimed in the
licensed patents are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not
terminating them. In particular, we depend on certain technologies relating to our MultiStem
technology licensed from the University of Minnesota, and the termination of this license could
result in our loss of some of the rights that enable us to utilize this technology, and our ability
to develop products based on MultiStem could be seriously hampered.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition, we may in the future acquire rights to additional technologies by licensing such
rights from existing licensors or from third parties. Such in-licenses may be costly. Also, we
generally do not control the patent prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of in-licensed
technologies. Accordingly, we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this
intellectual property as we do over our internally developed technologies. Moreover, some of our
academic institution licensors, collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data
and information to which we have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our
technologies and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations, our ability
to protect our proprietary information or obtain patent protection in the future may be impaired,
which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In addition to patents, we will substantially rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing
technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive
position. However, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary
information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our
technology. To protect our trade secrets, we may enter into confidentiality agreements with
employees, consultants and potential collaborators. However, these agreements may not provide
meaningful protection of our trade secrets or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or
disclosure of such information. Likewise, our trade secrets or know-how may become known through
other means or be independently discovered by our competitors. Any of these events could prevent us
from developing or commercializing our product candidates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are aware of other companies and academic institutions that have been performing research in the
areas of adult derived stem cells. In particular, other companies and academic institutions have
announced that they have identified nonembryonic stem cells isolated from bone marrow or other
tissues that have the ability to form a range of cell types, or display the property of
pluripotency. To the extent any of these companies or academic institutions currently have, or
obtain in the future, broad patent claims, such patents could block our ability to use various
aspects of our discovery and development process and might prevent us from developing or
commercializing newly discovered applications of our MultiStem technology, or otherwise conducting
our business. In addition, it is possible that some of the pharmaceutical product candidates we are
developing may not be patentable or may be covered by intellectual property of third parties.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are not currently a party to any litigation, interference, opposition, protest, reexamination or
any other potentially adverse governmental, ex parte or inter-party proceeding with regard to our
patent or trademark positions. However, the life sciences and other technology industries are
characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
Many life sciences and other technology companies have employed intellectual property litigation as
a way to gain a competitive advantage. If we become involved in litigation, interference
proceedings, oppositions, reexamination, protest or other potentially adverse intellectual property
proceedings as a result of alleged infringement by us of the rights of others or as a result of
priority of invention disputes with third parties, we might have to spend significant amounts of
money, time and effort defending our position and we may not be successful. In addition, any claims
relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights or proprietary determinations, even
if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert
management&#146;s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements
that are not advantageous to us. If we do not have the financial resources to support such
litigation or appeals, we may forfeit or lose certain commercial rights. Even if we have the
financial resources to continue such litigation or appeals, we may lose. In the event that we lose,
we may be forced to pay very substantial damages; we may have to obtain costly license rights,
which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all; or we may be prohibited from
selling products that are found to infringe the patent rights of others.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Should any person have filed patent applications or obtained patents that claim inventions also
claimed by us, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the relevant
patent regulatory agency to determine priority of invention and, thus, the right to a patent for
these inventions in the United States. Such a proceeding could result in substantial cost to us
even if the outcome is favorable. Even if successful on priority grounds, an interference action
may result in loss of claims based on patentability grounds raised in the interference action.
Litigation, interference proceedings or other proceedings could divert management&#146;s time and
efforts. Even unsuccessful claims could result in significant legal fees and other expenses,
diversion of management&#146;s time and disruption in our business. Uncertainties resulting from
initiation and continuation of any patent proceeding or related litigation could harm our ability
to compete and could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">An adverse ruling arising out of any intellectual property dispute, including an adverse decision
as to the priority of our inventions, could undercut or invalidate our intellectual property
position. An adverse ruling could also subject us to significant liability for damages, including
possible treble damages, prevent us from using technologies or developing products, or require us
to negotiate licenses to disputed rights from third parties. Although patent and intellectual
property disputes in the technology area are often settled through licensing or similar
arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include license
fees and ongoing royalties. Furthermore, necessary licenses may not be available to us on
satisfactory terms, if at all. Failure to obtain a license in such a case could have a significant
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We face significant competition with respect to our product candidates. With regard to our efforts
to develop MultiStem as a novel stem cell therapy, currently, there are a number of companies that
are actively developing stem cell products, which encompass a range of different cell types,
including embryonic stem cells, adult-derived stem cells, and processed bone marrow derived cells.
Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to
technological advances. Technological developments by others may result in our MultiStem product
platform and technologies, as well as our pharmaceutical formulations, becoming obsolete.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Foreign governments often impose strict price controls on approved products, which may adversely
affect our future profitability in those countries, and the re-importation of drugs to the United
States from foreign countries that impose price controls may adversely affect our future
profitability.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Frequently foreign governments impose strict price controls on newly approved therapeutic products.
If we obtain regulatory approval to sell products in foreign countries, we may be unable to obtain
a price that provides an adequate financial return on our investment. Furthermore, legislation in
the United States may permit re-importation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States,
including re-importation from foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in
the United States due to foreign government-mandated price controls. Such a practice, especially if
it is conducted on a widespread basis, may significantly reduce our potential United States
revenues from any drugs that we are able to develop.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>If we elect not to sell our products in foreign countries that impose government mandated price
controls because we decide it is uneconomical to do so, a foreign government or patent office may
attempt to terminate our intellectual property rights in that country, enabling competitors to make
and sell our products.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In some cases we may choose not to sell a product in a foreign country because it is uneconomical
to do so under a system of government-imposed price controls, or because it could severely limit
our profitability in the United States or other markets. In such cases, a foreign government or
patent office may terminate any intellectual property rights we may obtain with respect to that
product. Such a termination could enable competitors to produce and sell our product in that
market. Furthermore, such products may be exported into the United States through legislation that
authorizes the importation of drugs from outside the United States. In such an event, we may have
to reduce our prices, or we may be unable to compete with low-cost providers of our drugs, and we
could be financially harmed as a result.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We may encounter difficulties managing our growth, which could adversely affect our business.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">At various times we have experienced periods of rapid growth in our employee numbers as a result of
a dramatic increase in activity in technology programs, genomics programs, collaborative research
programs, discovery programs, and scope of operations. At other times, we have had to reduce staff
in order to bring our expenses in line with our financial resources. Our success will also depend
on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to improve our operational
capabilities and our management information and financial control systems, and to expand, train and
manage our work force.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>We may be sued for product liability, which could adversely affect our business.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Because our business strategy involves the development and sale by either us or our collaborators
of commercial products, we may be sued for product liability. We may be held liable if any product
we develop and commercialize, or any product our collaborators commercialize that incorporates any
of our technology, causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing,
manufacturing, marketing, sale or consumer use. In addition, the safety studies we must perform and
the regulatory approvals required to commercialize our pharmaceutical products, will not protect us
from any such liability.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We carry product liability insurance, as well as liability insurance for conducting clinical
trials. Currently, we carry a $5&nbsp;million per event, $5&nbsp;million annual aggregate coverage for both
our products liability policy and our clinical trials protection. We also intend to seek product
liability insurance for any approved products that we may develop or acquire. However, in the event
there are product liability claims against us, our insurance may be insufficient to cover the
expense of defending against such claims, or may be insufficient to pay or settle such claims.
Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain adequate product liability insurance coverage for
commercial sales of any of our approved products. If such insurance is insufficient to protect us,
our results of operations will suffer. If any product liability claim is made against us, our
reputation and future sales will be damaged, even if we have adequate insurance coverage.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>The availability, manner, and amount of reimbursement for our product candidates from government
and private payers are uncertain, and our inability to obtain adequate reimbursement for any
products could severely limit our product sales.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We expect that many of the patients who seek treatment with any of our products that are approved
for marketing will be eligible for Medicare benefits. Other patients may be covered by private
health plans. If we are unable to obtain or retain adequate levels of reimbursement from Medicare
or from private health plans, our ability to sell our
products will be severely limited. The application of existing Medicare regulations and
interpretive coverage and payment determinations to newly approved products is uncertain and those
regulations and interpretive determinations are subject to change. The Medicare Prescription Drug
Improvement and Modernization Act, enacted in December&nbsp;2003, provides for a change in reimbursement
methodology that reduces the Medicare reimbursement rates for many drugs, which may adversely
affect reimbursement for any products we may develop. Medicare regulations and interpretive
determinations also may determine who may be reimbursed for certain services, and may limit the
pool of patients our product candidates are being developed to serve.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Federal, state and foreign governments continue to propose legislation designed to contain or
reduce health care costs. Legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of products like our
potential products may change further or be adopted before any of our potential products are
approved for marketing. Cost control initiatives by governments or third-party payers could
decrease the price that we receive for any one or all of our potential products or increase patient
coinsurance to a level that make our products under development become unaffordable. In addition,
government and private health plans persistently challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of
therapeutic products. Accordingly, these third parties may ultimately not consider any or all of
our products under development to be cost effective, which could result in products not being
covered under their health plans or covered only at a lower price. Any of these initiatives or
developments could prevent us from successfully marketing and selling any of our products that are
approved for commercialization.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Public perception of ethical and social issues surrounding the use of adult-derived stem cell
technology may limit or discourage the use of our technologies, which may reduce the demand for our
therapeutic products and technologies and reduce our revenues.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our success will depend in part upon our ability to develop therapeutic products incorporating or
discovered through our adult-derived stem cell technology. For social, ethical, or other reasons,
governmental authorities in the United States and other countries may call for limits on, or
regulation of the use of, adult-derived stem cell technologies. Although we do not use the more
controversial stem cells derived from embryos or fetuses, claims that adult-derived stem cell
technologies are ineffective, unethical or pose a danger to the environment may influence public
attitudes. The subject of stem cell technologies in general has received negative publicity and
aroused public debate in the United States and some other countries. Ethical and other concerns
about our adult-derived stem cell technology could materially hurt the market acceptance of our
therapeutic products and technologies, resulting in diminished sales and use of any products we are
able to develop using adult-derived stem cells.

Cede &#038; Co., a nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or DTC. Shares of common stock that are
held by financial institutions as nominees for beneficial owners are deposited into participant

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We would have to rely upon dividends and other payments from our wholly-owned subsidiary, ABT
Holding Company, to generate the funds necessary to make dividend payments, if any, on our common
stock. ABT Holding Company, however, is legally distinct from us and has no obligation to pay
amounts to us. The ability of ABT Holding Company to make dividend and other payments to us is
subject to, among other things, the availability of funds and applicable state laws. However, there
are no restrictions such as government regulations or material contractual arrangements that
restrict the ability of ABT Holding Company to make dividend and other payments to us. We did not
pay cash dividends on our common stock during the past two years. We do not anticipate that we
will pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Rather, we anticipate that we
will retain earnings, if any, for use in the development of our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic
product candidates designed to extend and enhance the quality of human life. Through the
application of our proprietary technologies, we have established a pipeline of therapeutic product
development programs in multiple disease areas. Our current product development portfolio includes
MultiStem, a patented and proprietary stem cell product that we are developing as a treatment for
multiple disease indications, and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. In addition, we
are developing novel pharmaceuticals to treat indications such as obesity and related metabolic
conditions such as diabetes.

undergo radiation therapy and then receive a HSC transplant. Such patients are at risk
for serious complications, including GVHD, which is an imbalance of immune system function
caused by transplanted immune cells that attack various tissues and organs in the patient.
In January&nbsp;2011, we announced that we had successfully completed enrollment for the single
ascending dose portion of this clinical trial and expect to announce preliminary results

preclinical development and evaluation of MultiStem in other disease indications in the
cardiovascular, neurological and immune disorder areas. We conduct such work both through our own
internal research efforts and through a broad network of collaborations we have established with
investigators at leading research institutions across the U.S. and in Europe.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are also engaged in the development of novel small molecule therapies to treat obesity and
related metabolic conditions, including diabetes, as well as other conditions. Currently we are
focused on the development of potent, highly selective compounds that act through stimulation of a
specific receptor in the brain that controls appetite &#151; the 5HT2c serotonin receptor. We are
conducting preclinical evaluation of novel compounds that we have developed that exhibit
outstanding selectivity, and intend to select a clinical development candidate for this program in
2011.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2010, we entered into an agreement with RTI to develop and commercialize MAPC
technology-based biologic implants for certain orthopedic applications in the bone graft
substitutes market. The agreement provides for a $5.0&nbsp;million license fee paid in installments, of
which $3.0&nbsp;million is guaranteed and $2.0&nbsp;million is contingent, potential milestone payments and
tiered royalties on worldwide commercial sales of implants using our technologies. We are currently
working with RTI to develop products for these applications.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In
February&nbsp;2011, we completed a registered direct offering
generating net proceeds of $11.8
million through the issuance of 4,366,667 shares of common stock and five-year warrants to purchase
1,310,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $3.55 per share. The securities were
sold in multiples of a fixed combination of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase 0.3
of a share of common stock at an offering price of $3.00 per fixed combination.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have incurred losses since inception of operations in December&nbsp;1995 and had an accumulated
deficit of $205&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2010. Our losses have resulted principally from costs
incurred in research and development, clinical and preclinical product development, acquisition and
licensing costs, and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We have used
the financing proceeds from private and public equity and debt offerings and other sources of
capital to develop our technologies, to discover and develop therapeutic product candidates and to
acquire certain technologies and assets. We have also built drug development capabilities that have
enabled us to advance product candidates into clinical trials. We have established strategic
collaborations that have provided revenues and capabilities to help further advance our product
candidates, and we have also built a substantial portfolio of intellectual property.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Since our inception, our revenues have consisted of contract revenues and milestone payments
from our collaborators, and grant proceeds primarily from federal and state grants. We have derived
no revenue from therapeutic products to date. Research and development expenses consist primarily
of external clinical and preclinical study fees, manufacturing costs, salaries and related
personnel costs, legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution processes,
facility costs, and laboratory supply and reagent costs. We expense research and development costs
as they are incurred. We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and
development to enhance our technologies, advance clinical trials of our product candidates, expand
our regulatory affairs and product development capabilities, conduct preclinical studies of our
product and manufacture our product candidates. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.
We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through at least the next several years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Revenues. </I>Revenues increased to $8.9&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 from $2.2
million for 2009. Contract revenue increased $5.6&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010
compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 primarily as a result of our collaboration with Pfizer
that we entered into in December&nbsp;2009 and our collaboration with RTI that we entered into in
September&nbsp;2010. Contract revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 primarily consist of the
recognition of revenue from these multi-element arrangements. We expect our contract revenues
related to the Pfizer collaboration in 2011 and 2012 to reflect the amortization of the $6.0
million non-refundable up-front license fee, research and development funding, and the performance
of manufacturing services over the estimated performance period, and expect our contract revenues
related to the RTI collaboration to reflect the amortization of the $3.0&nbsp;million license fee over
the next several quarters aligned with the estimated performance period. Grant revenue increased
$1.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009
primarily due a grant received in October&nbsp;2010 from the Internal Revenue Service under section 48D
of the Internal Revenue Code aggregating $733,000 for qualifying therapeutic discovery investments,
as well as additional new grants that began late in 2009 and in 2010. Our grant revenues could
fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of grant-related activities and the award of
new grants.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Research and Development Expenses</I>. Research and development expenses increased to $14.8
million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 from $11.9&nbsp;million in 2009. The increase of
approximately $2.9&nbsp;million related primarily to an increase in clinical and preclinical development
costs of $2.5&nbsp;million, an increase in personnel costs of $517,000, an increase in research supply
costs of $311,000 and an increase in sponsored research costs of $271,000 for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2010 compared to 2009. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease in stock-based
compensation expense of $751,000, which declined as a result of a significant number of options
becoming fully vested mid-2010. The increase in clinical and preclinical development costs for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 related primarily to increased manufacturing and process development
costs, and costs associated with our MultiStem clinical trials. Our clinical costs for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2009 are reflected net of Angiotech&#146;s cost-sharing amount of $628,000
and $847,000, respectively. The increase in personnel costs and
research supplies related to the addition of personnel in support of our preclinical and clinical
programs and regulatory affairs. Sponsored research costs increased primarily due to grant-funded
programs that require collaboration with certain academic research institutions. We expect our
research and development expenses to increase in 2011, primarily due to increased MultiStem
clinical trial and clinical manufacturing expenses.
 Other than external expenses for our clinical and preclinical programs, we do not track our
research expenses by project; rather, we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>General and Administrative Expenses. </I>General and administrative expenses decreased to $5.4&nbsp;million
in 2010 from $5.6&nbsp;million in 2009. The $234,000 decrease was due
primarily to a decrease in stock-based
compensation expense of $591,000, partially offset by an increase in other expenses of $364,000 in
2010 compared to 2009. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense related to a significant number
of options becoming fully vested mid-2010. The increase in other expenses for 2010 was primarily a
result of increased investor and public relations costs and travel costs. We expect our general
and administrative expenses to continue at similar levels in 2011.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Depreciation. </I>Depreciation expense increased to $284,000 in 2010 from $233,000 in 2009. The
increase in depreciation expense was due to depreciation on capital purchases made in 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Other Expense. </I>Included in other expense are impairment losses of $46,000 and $115,000 in 2010 and
2009, respectively, related to an investment in a privately-held company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Interest Income. </I>Interest income decreased to $203,000 in 2010 from $375,000 in 2009. The
change in interest income was due to the decline in cash and investment balances during the period.
We expect our 2011 interest income to continue at similar levels in 2011, taking into
consideration the expected increase in our clinical development costs in 2011 and the investment of
the proceeds from the February&nbsp;2011 equity offering.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Revenues. </I>Revenues decreased to $2.2&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 from $3.1
million for 2008. Contract revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 included $171,000 of
revenues from Pfizer in connection with our collaboration agreement entered into in December&nbsp;2009.
Also included in contract revenues are license fees and milestone payments from our collaboration
with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which decreased in 2009 as a result of a decline in activity and as a
result of a clinical development milestone achieved in September&nbsp;2008. We intend to continue to
prepare and deliver validated drug targets as needed by Bristol-Myers Squibb for use in its drug
discovery efforts, and will remain entitled to receive license fees, milestone payments and
royalties on compounds developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb using our technology. Grant revenue
decreased $145,000 primarily due to the completion of a state grant in 2008 and due to the timing
of expenditures that are reimbursed with grant proceeds.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><I>Research and Development Expenses. </I>Research and development expenses decreased to $11.9
million in 2009 from $16.5&nbsp;million in 2008. The decrease of $4.6&nbsp;million related primarily to a
decrease in clinical and preclinical development costs of $6.0&nbsp;million, a decrease in other
research and development expenses of $280,000 and a decrease in patent legal fee expense
of $130,000 in 2009 compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in
personnel costs of $683,000, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $569,000, an increase in
sponsored research of $485,000, and an increase in research supplies and facilities expenses of
$67,000 in 2009 compared to 2008. Of the $6.0&nbsp;million decrease in clinical and preclinical
development costs, $5.3&nbsp;million related to costs associated with the completion of an ATHX-105
Phase I clinical trial in the first half of 2008 and preparations for a Phase II clinical trial of
ATHX-105 in 2008, which included several preclinical studies and manufacturing costs. ATHX-105
development was suspended early in 2009 and there will be no future costs incurred for this product
candidate. The remaining $700,000 decrease in clinical and preclinical development costs
related primarily to a $235,000 credit from a renegotiated contract with a contract research
organization in June&nbsp;2009, reduced manufacturing costs associated with our MultiStem clinical
trials, and reduced external costs for regulatory consulting and preclinical studies. Our clinical
costs in 2009 and 2008 are reflected net of Angiotech&#146;s cost-sharing reimbursements related to our
MultiStem acute myocardial infarction collaboration in the amount of $847,000 and $943,000,
respectively. Patent legal fee expense for 2009 decreased compared to 2008, but
continued to be significant as a result of further development and maintaining our portfolio of
patent applications. The increase in
personnel costs related to the addition of personnel in support of our clinical programs and
regulatory affairs, a 2009 company-wide performance bonus, salary increases and increased benefit
costs. The increase in stock-based compensation expense related to a change in our estimated forfeiture
rate, increased expense related to options held by certain consultants that are computed using
variable accounting, and the issuance of stock option awards in 2009. Sponsored research costs
increased primarily due to grant-funded programs that require collaboration with certain academic
research institutions. Other than external expenses for our clinical and preclinical programs, we
do not track our research expenses by project; rather, we track such expenses by the type of cost
incurred.

in 2009 from $5.5&nbsp;million in 2008. The $100,000 increase was due
primarily to an increase in stock-based

by a decrease in other expenses of $331,000, a decrease in legal and professional fees of $116,000
and a decrease in facilities expense of $43,000 in 2009 compared to
2008. The increase in stock-based
compensation expense related to a change in our estimated forfeiture rate and the issuance of stock
option awards in 2009. The increase in personnel costs related to a 2009 company-wide performance
bonus, salary increases and increased benefit costs. The decrease in other expenses for 2009 was
primarily a result of reduced temporary help and outsourced accounting services in 2009. The
decrease in legal and professional fees in 2009 was primarily a result of reduced legal fees
incurred in connection with SEC filings and transactional work.

December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had $2.1&nbsp;million in cash and cash equivalents and $13.1&nbsp;million in
available-for-sale securities. We have primarily financed our operations through private equity
and debt financings. We conduct all of our operations through our subsidiary, ABT Holding Company.
Consequently, our ability to fund our operations depends on ABT Holding Company&#146;s financial
condition and its ability to make dividend payments or other cash distributions to us. There are
no restrictions such as government regulations or material contractual arrangements that restrict
the ability of ABT Holding Company to make dividend and other payments to us.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our former lenders retain a right to receive a milestone payment of $2.25&nbsp;million upon the
occurrence of certain events as follows: (1)&nbsp;the entire amount upon (a)&nbsp;the merger with or into
another entity where our stockholders do not hold at least a majority of the voting power of the
surviving entity, (b)&nbsp;the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or (c)&nbsp;our liquidation or
dissolution; or (2)&nbsp;a portion of the amount from proceeds of equity financings not tied to specific
research and development activities that are part of a research or development collaboration, in
which case, the lenders will receive an amount equal to 10% of proceeds above $5.0&nbsp;million in
cumulative gross proceeds until the milestone amount is paid in full. The milestone payment is
payable in cash, except that if the milestone event is (2)&nbsp;above, we may elect to pay 75% of the
milestone in shares of common stock at the per-share offering price. No amounts have been
recorded for the milestone in December&nbsp;31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. In connection with the offering in
February&nbsp;2011, the lenders were entitled to a milestone payment under this obligation in the amount
of $810,000, of which $202,500 was paid in cash in February&nbsp;2011
and $607,500 was paid through the
issuance of our common stock to the former lenders at $2.96 per share. The senior lenders also
received warrants to purchase 149,026 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $5.00 upon
the closing of our equity offering in June&nbsp;2007. The exercise of such warrants could provide us
with cash proceeds. No warrants were exercised at December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In December&nbsp;2009, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to develop and
commercialize MultiStem for the treatment of IBD for the worldwide market. Under the terms of the
agreement, we received a non-refundable up-front cash payment of $6&nbsp;million from Pfizer and will
also receive research funding and support. In addition, we are also eligible to receive milestone
payments of up to $105&nbsp;million upon the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory
and commercial milestones, though there can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones.
Pfizer pays us for manufacturing product for clinical development and commercialization purposes.
Pfizer has responsibility for development, regulatory and commercialization and will pay us
tiered royalties on worldwide commercial sales of MultiStem IBD products. Alternatively, in lieu
of royalties and certain commercialization milestones, we may elect to co-develop with Pfizer and
the parties will share development and commercialization expenses and profits/losses on an agreed
basis beginning at Phase III clinical development.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection with our MultiStem collaboration with Angiotech, upon the successful achievement of
specified clinical development and commercialization milestones, we may also receive up to $63.75
million of aggregate cash payments and $3.75&nbsp;million from an additional equity investment, though
there can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones. Under the terms of the
collaboration, the parties are jointly funding clinical development activity, whereby preclinical
costs are borne solely by us, costs for Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are borne 50% by us
and 50% by Angiotech, costs for the first Phase III clinical trial will be borne 33% by us and 67%
by Angiotech, and costs for any subsequent Phase III clinical trial will be borne 25% by us and 75%
by Angiotech. We have lead responsibility for preclinical and early clinical development and
manufacturing of the MultiStem product, and Angiotech has lead responsibility for later clinical
trials and commercialization. Upon product commercialization, we will receive nearly half of the
net profits from the sale of any jointly developed, approved products. In January&nbsp;2011, Angiotech
announced its plans to pursue a recapitalization transaction through its voluntary filing under the
Companies&#146; Creditors Arrangement Act in Canada.





In the event that Angiotech elects not to continue with our

collaboration, Angiotech would return
all rights to us and we would have an outstanding claim related to Angiotech&#146;s reimbursement of our
fourth quarter 2010 collaboration costs and the costs through January&nbsp;28, 2011, which was
Angiotech&#146;s petition date.



 In the event that Angiotech fails to fund its
obligations under the terms of our collaboration agreement, our net costs for subsequent AMI
clinical trials would increase or alternative funding would be required for such clinical trials.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2010, we entered into an agreement with RTI to develop and commercialize MAPC
technology-based biologic implants for certain orthopedic applications in the bone graft
substitutes market. Under the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to a $5.0&nbsp;million license
fee paid in installments, of which $3.0&nbsp;million is guaranteed and $2.0&nbsp;million is contingent, of
which $2.0&nbsp;million has been received by December&nbsp;31, 2010. We are also eligible to receive an
additional $35.5&nbsp;million in cash payments upon the successful achievement of certain development
and commercial milestones, though there can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones.
In addition, we will receive tiered royalties on worldwide commercial sales of implants using our
technologies.

in 2009. We are preparing and delivering the final validated drug target for use by Bristol-Myers
Squibb in its drug discovery efforts under the collaboration and do not expect any significant
demand for new targets. We will remain entitled to receive license fees for targets that were
delivered to Bristol-Myers Squibb over the course of the collaboration, as well as milestone
payments and royalties on compounds developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb using our technology, though
there can be no assurance that we will achieve any milestones or royalties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our available-for-sale securities typically include U.S. government obligations and corporate debt
securities. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, approximately 85% of our investments were in U.S. government
obligations, including government-backed agencies. We have been investing conservatively due to
economic conditions and have prioritized liquidity and the preservation of principal in lieu of
potentially higher returns. As a result, we have experienced no losses on the principal of our
investments and have held our investments until maturity. Also, although these unfavorable market
and economic conditions have resulted in a decrease to our market capitalization, there has been no
impairment to the value of our assets. Our fixed assets are used for internal research and
development and, therefore, are not impacted by these external factors.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We will require substantial additional funding in order to continue our research and product
development programs, including preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates.
We expect to have available cash to fund our operations through 2011 based on our current business
and operational plans and assuming no new financings or collaborations. Our capital requirements
beyond that will depend on a number of factors, including scientific progress in our research and
development programs, additional personnel costs, progress in preclinical testing and clinical
trials, and the costs in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing patent claims.
Further, these requirements may change at any time due to technological advances or competition
from other companies. We will continue to explore and consider new opportunities for funding our
operations and activities through grants and business partnerships involving our technologies and
product candidates, as well as selling equity securities and possibly borrowings from financial
institutions. We cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available to us or, if available,
that it will be available on acceptable terms. Any shortfall in funding could result in our having
to curtail research and development efforts.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We expect to continue to incur substantial losses through at least the next several years and may
incur losses in subsequent periods. The amount and timing of our future losses are highly
uncertain. Our ability to achieve and thereafter sustain profitability will be dependent upon,
among other things, successfully developing, obtaining regulatory approval or clearances for, and
commercializing our technologies and products resulting from these technologies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net cash used in operating activities was $10.6&nbsp;million, $4.6&nbsp;million and $15.7&nbsp;million in 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively, and represented the use of cash in funding clinical and preclinical
product development activities. We expect that net cash used in operating activities will increase
in 2011 in connection with increased research and development expenses of our MultiStem clinical
trials and our Pfizer and Angiotech collaborations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.5&nbsp;million in 2010, $3.2&nbsp;million in 2009 and
$16.8&nbsp;million in 2008. The fluctuations from period to period are due to the timing of purchases
and maturity dates of investments and the purchase of equipment. Purchases of equipment were
$390,000, $381,000 and $532,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We expect that our capital
equipment expenditures will continue at similar levels in 2011 compared to 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Financing activities neither used nor provided cash in 2010 and 2009, and used cash of $1.8

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We lease office and laboratory space under an operating lease and have options to renew the
lease in annual increments through March&nbsp;2013 at the initial rental rate, and we executed options
to renew through March&nbsp;2012. Also, we lease office and laboratory space for our Belgian subsidiary
that includes options to renew annually through December&nbsp;2014 and the annual rent is subject
to adjustments based on an inflationary index. We executed an option to renew this lease
through January&nbsp;2012.

program that began in 2007. We approved the funding for the final stage of the collaboration that
will continue through August&nbsp;2012.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We filed a resale registration statement with the SEC for 18,508,251 shares of common stock, which
includes all shares of common stock issued in the equity offering in June&nbsp;2007 and shares of common
stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in the offering (as well as the 531,781 shares
of common stock issued to the bridge investors and the 132,945 shares underlying their warrants).
The resale registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on October&nbsp;18, 2007. Under the
registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the offering, subject to certain
exceptions, if the resale registration statement ceases to remain effective, a 1% cash penalty will
be assessed for each 30-day period until the registration statement becomes effective again, capped
at 10% of the aggregate gross proceeds we received from the equity offering. Because the penalty
is based on the number of unregistered shares of common stock held by investors in the offering,
our maximum penalty exposure will decline over time as investors sell their shares of common stock
that were included in the registration statement.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those that are, in management&#146;s view,
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and demanding of
management&#146;s judgment. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation
are based on Athersys&#146; consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we
believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">A discussion of the material implications of uncertainties associated with the methods,
assumptions and estimates underlying our critical accounting polices is as follows:
</DIV>





<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our license and collaboration agreements may contain multiple elements,
including license and technology access fees, research and development funding,
manufacturing revenue, cost-sharing, milestones and royalties. The deliverables
under such an arrangement are evaluated under Accounting Standards
Codification, or ASC, 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements, (which originated
primarily from the guidance in EITF 00-21) to assess whether they have
standalone value and objective and reliable evidence of fair value, and if so,
are accounted for as a single unit. We then recognize revenue for each unit
based on the culmination of the earnings process under ASC 605-S25 (issued as
SAB Topic 13) and our estimated performance period for the single units of
accounting based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement. We
subsequently adjust the estimated performance periods, if appropriate, on a
prospective basis based upon available facts and circumstances. Future changes
in estimates of the performance period may materially impact the timing of
future revenue recognized. Amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue
recognition criteria for contract revenues are recorded as deferred revenue in
the accompanying balance sheets. Reimbursement amounts (other than those
accounted for using collaboration accounting) paid to us are recorded on a
gross basis in the statements of operations as contract revenues.</div>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">
We entered into collaboration agreements with Pfizer and RTI that contain
multiple elements and deliverables. For a description of the collaboration
agreement and the determination of contract revenues, see Note E to our
consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Also included in contract revenue are license fees received from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which are
specifically set forth in the license and collaboration agreement as amounts due to us based on our
completion of certain tasks (e.g., delivery and acceptance of a cell line) and development
milestones (e.g., clinical trial Phases), and as such, are not based on estimates that are
susceptible to change. Such amounts are invoiced and recorded as revenue as tasks are completed
and as milestones are achieved.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Similarly, grant revenue consists of funding under cost reimbursement programs primarily from
federal and state sources for qualified research and development activities performed by us, and
as such, are not based on estimates that are susceptible to change. Such amounts are invoiced
(unless prepaid) and recorded as revenue as tasks are completed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Collaborative Arrangements</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Collaborative arrangements that involve cost or future profit sharing are reviewed to determine the
nature of the arrangement and the nature of the collaborative parties&#146; businesses. The
arrangements are also reviewed to determine if one party has sole or primary responsibility for an
activity, or whether the parties have shared responsibility for the activity. If responsibility
for an activity is shared and there is no principal party, then the related costs of that activity
are recognized by us on a net basis in the statement of operations (e.g., total cost less
reimbursement from collaborator). If we are deemed to be the principal party for an activity, then
the costs and revenues associated with that activity are recognized on a gross basis in the
statement of operations. The accounting may be susceptible to change if the nature of a
collaborator&#146;s business changes. Currently, our only collaboration accounted for on a net basis is
our cost-sharing collaboration with Angiotech.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Clinical Trial Costs</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Clinical trial costs are accrued based on work performed by outside contractors who manage and
perform the trials. We obtain initial estimates of total costs based on enrollment of subjects,
project management estimates and other activities. Actual costs are typically charged to us and
recognized as the tasks are completed by the contractor. Accrued clinical trial costs may be
subject to revisions as clinical trials progress, and any revisions are recorded in the period in
which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known. Since such actual costs are
typically invoiced as incurred or based on contractual amounts for services rendered, the amounts
are generally not susceptible to significant changes in estimates.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We determine the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase and
re-evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investments typically consist
primarily of United States government obligations and corporate debt securities, which are
classified as available-for-sale and are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets (Level 1). Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income.
Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income. The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest earned on
securities classified as available-for-sale is included in interest income. Since the elements
related to accounting for these investments are reflected on monthly statements, the amounts are
not based on estimates that are susceptible to change. None of our financial assets are in markets
that are not active.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We recognize stock-based compensation expense on the straight-line method and use a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of share-based awards. The expected
term of options granted represent the period of time that option grants are expected to be
outstanding. We use the &#147;simplified&#148; method to calculate the expected life of option grants given
our limited history and beginning in 2010, determine volatility by using our historical stock
volatility. Prior to 2010, we determined volatility by using the historical stock volatility of
other companies with similar characteristics since we did not have meaningful historical volatility
of our own stock at that time. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future
events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and if our expectations on forfeitures changes. If
actual forfeitures vary from the estimate, we will recognize the difference in compensation expense
in the period the actual forfeitures occur or when options vest.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of the aforementioned estimates and assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis and may
change as facts and circumstances warrant. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the
estimate of the fair value of our share-based payments and the related amount recognized in our
financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Recently Issued Accounting Standards</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2009, ASC 605-25, <I>Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>, was updated (Accounting
Standards Update, or ASU, No.&nbsp;2009-13) related to revenue recognition for arrangements with
multiple elements. The revised guidance provides for two significant changes to the existing
guidance, the first relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a
multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting, which will likely
result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement leading to less
revenue deferral. The second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is
allocated across the separately identified deliverables. Together, these changes are likely to
result in earlier recognition of revenue for multiple-element arrangements than under previous
guidance. The new guidance also significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple-element
revenue arrangements. The new guidance is effective for the Company for new arrangements entered
into on or after January&nbsp;1, 2011. The future adoption of this new guidance may have the potential
effect of less revenue deferral for new collaborations than we have historically experienced.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In March&nbsp;2010, ASC 605-28, <I>Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition</I>, was amended (ASU No.&nbsp;2010-17)
related to the ratification of the application of the proportional performance model of revenue
recognition when applied to milestones in research and development arrangements. Accordingly, the
consensus states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to recognize a payment that
is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in
which the milestone is achieved. The new guidance is effective for the Company for new arrangements
entered into on or after January&nbsp;1, 2011. This new guidance will not have a material effect on our
financial statements upon adoption, since we have been historically recognizing milestone revenue
consistent with this guidance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our exposure to interest rate risk is related to our investment portfolio and our borrowings,
if any. Fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted
from changes in interest rates. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall
short of expectations. Further, we may suffer losses in investment principal if we are forced to
sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. We invest our
excess cash primarily in debt instruments of the U.S. government and
its agencies and corporate debt securities. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, approximately 85% of our investments were
in U.S. government obligations, including government-backed agencies. We have been investing
conservatively due to the current economic conditions, including the current credit crisis, and
have prioritized liquidity and the preservation of principal in lieu of potentially higher returns.
As a result, we have experienced no losses on the principal of our investments.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We enter into loan arrangements with financial institutions when needed and when available to us.
At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding.

Athersys, Inc.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Athersys, Inc. as of December&nbsp;31,
2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We
were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.
Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Athersys, Inc. at December&nbsp;31, 2010 and
2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

<!-- xbrl,body -->
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic products
in one business segment. Operations consist primarily of research and product development
activities.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and results of operations and those of
our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method when we do
not control the investee, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the
investee&#146;s operations and financial policies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Revenue Recognition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Our license and collaboration agreements may contain multiple elements,
including license and technology access fees, research and development funding,
manufacturing revenue, cost-sharing, milestones and royalties. The deliverables
under such an arrangement are evaluated under Accounting Standards Codification
(&#147;ASC&#148;) 605-25, <I>Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>, (which originated primarily from
the guidance in EITF 00-21) to assess whether they have standalone value and
objective and reliable evidence of fair value, and if so, are accounted for as
a single unit. We then recognize revenue for each unit based on the
culmination of the earnings process under ASC 605-S25 (issued as SAB Topic 13)
and our estimated performance period for the single units of accounting based
on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement. We subsequently adjust
the estimated performance periods, if appropriate, on a prospective basis based
upon available facts and circumstances. Future changes in estimates of the
performance period may materially impact the timing of future revenue
recognized. Amounts received prior to satisfying the revenue recognition
criteria for contract revenues are recorded as deferred revenue in the
accompanying balance sheets. Reimbursement amounts (other than those accounted
for using collaboration accounting) paid to us are recorded on a gross basis in
the statements of operations as contract revenues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Also included in contract revenue are license fees received from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which are
specifically set forth in the license and collaboration agreement as amounts due to us based on our
completion of certain tasks (e.g., delivery and acceptance of a cell line) and development
milestones (e.g., clinical trial phases), and as such, are not based on estimates that are
susceptible to change. Such amounts are invoiced and recorded as revenue as tasks are completed
and as milestones are achieved.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Similarly, grant revenue consists of funding under cost reimbursement programs primarily from
federal and state sources for qualified research and development activities performed by us, and as
such, are not based on estimates that are susceptible to change. Such amounts are invoiced (unless
prepaid) and recorded as revenue as tasks are completed. Included in 2010 grant revenues is a
grant of $733,000 received from the Internal Revenue Service under section 48D of the Internal
Revenue Code for qualifying therapeutic discovery investments that have been incurred.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to
be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds and commercial
paper. The carrying amount of our cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short
maturity of the investments.
</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Research and development expenditures, which consist primarily of costs associated with external
clinical and preclinical study fees, manufacturing costs, salaries and related personnel costs,
legal expenses resulting from intellectual property application processes, and laboratory supply
and reagent costs, including direct and allocated overhead expenses, are charged to expense as
incurred.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Collaborative arrangements that involve cost or future profit sharing are reviewed to determine the
nature of the arrangement and the nature of the collaborative parties&#146; businesses. The
arrangements are also reviewed to determine if one party has sole or primary responsibility for an
activity, or whether the parties have shared responsibility for the activity. If responsibility
for an activity is shared and there is no principal party, then the related costs of that activity
are recognized by us on a net basis in the statement of operations (e.g., total cost less
reimbursement
from collaborator). If we are deemed to be the principal party for an activity, then the costs and
revenues associated with that activity are recognized on a gross basis in the statement of
operations. The accounting may be susceptible to change if the nature of a collaborator&#146;s business
changes. Currently, our only collaboration accounted for on a net basis is our cost-sharing
collaboration with Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Angiotech&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Clinical Trial Costs</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Clinical trial costs are accrued based on work performed by outside contractors, who manage and
perform the trials. We obtain initial estimates of total costs based on enrollment of subjects,
project management estimates and other activities. Actual costs are typically charged to us and
recognized as the tasks are completed by the contractor. Accrued clinical trial costs may be
subject to revisions as clinical trials progress, and any revisions are recorded in the period in
which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known.
</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We may be required to make royalty payments to certain parties based on product sales under license
agreements. We did not pay any royalties during the three-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2010.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><B>Investments in Available-for-Sale Securities</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We determine the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase and
re-evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investments typically consist of
U.S. government obligations and corporate debt securities, which are classified as
available-for-sale and are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
(Level 1). Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and
losses, net of applicable tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity. Such amortization or accretion is included in interest income. Realized
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income. The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest earned on securities
classified as available-for-sale is included in interest income. None of our financial assets are
in markets that are not active.

are depreciated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (three to seven years).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset or related group of assets may not be recoverable. If the
expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an
impairment loss is recognized at that time. Measurement of impairment may be based upon appraisal,
market value of similar assets or discounted cash flows.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In connection primarily with a milestone that was achieved in 2006, we and an affiliate own
preferred stock in a privately-held company with an aggregate value of approximately $300,000. We

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">We recognize stock-based compensation expense on the straight-line method and use a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model to estimate the grant-date fair value of share-based awards. The expected
term of options granted represent the period of time that option grants are expected to be
outstanding. We use the &#147;simplified&#148; method to calculate the expected life of option grants given
our limited history and beginning in 2010, determine volatility by using our historical stock
volatility. Prior to 2010, we determined volatility by using the historical stock volatility of
other companies with similar characteristics since we did not have meaningful historical volatility
of our own stock at that time. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future
events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If actual forfeitures vary from the
estimate, we recognize the difference in compensation expense in the period the actual forfeitures
occur or when options vest.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">All of the aforementioned estimates and assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis and may
change as facts and circumstances warrant. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the
estimate of the fair value of our share-based payments and the related amount recognized in our
financial statements

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2009, ASC 605-25, <I>Multiple-Element Arrangements</I>, was updated (Accounting Standards
Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) No.&nbsp;2009-13) related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple elements.
The revised guidance provides for two significant changes to the existing guidance, the first
relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element
arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting, which will likely result in the
requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement leading to less revenue deferral.
The second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across
the separately identified deliverables. Together, these changes are likely to result in earlier
recognition of revenue for multiple-element arrangements than under previous guidance. The new
guidance also significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple-element revenue
arrangements. The new guidance is effective for the Company for new arrangements entered into on or
after January&nbsp;1, 2011. The future adoption of this new guidance may have the potential effect of
less revenue deferral for new collaborations than we have historically experienced.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">In March&nbsp;2010, ASC 605-28, <I>Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition</I>, was amended (ASU No.&nbsp;2010-17)
related to the ratification of the application of the proportional performance model of revenue
recognition when applied to milestones in research and development arrangements. Accordingly, the
consensus states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to recognize a payment that
is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in
which the milestone is achieved. The new guidance is effective for the Company for new arrangements
entered into on or after January&nbsp;1, 2011. This new guidance will not have a material effect on our
financial statements upon adoption, since we have been historically recognizing milestone revenue
consistent with this guidance.
