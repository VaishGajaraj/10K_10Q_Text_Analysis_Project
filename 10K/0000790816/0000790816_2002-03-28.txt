                                     ------

Item 1. Business

General

Brandywine Realty Trust (collectively with its subsidiaries, the "Company") is a
self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") active
in acquiring, developing, redeveloping, leasing and managing office and
industrial properties. As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned 223 office
properties, 46 industrial facilities and one mixed-use property (the
"Properties") containing an aggregate of approximately 17.3 million net rentable
square feet and managed an additional 43 properties containing 3.3 million net
rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2001, the Company also owned
approximately 443 acres of undeveloped land and held options to purchase
approximately 61 additional acres. The properties, owned and managed by the
Company, are located in the office and industrial markets surrounding
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; New Jersey and Long Island, New York; and Richmond,
Virginia.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company also owned economic interests in thirteen
real estate ventures (the "Real Estate Ventures") with an aggregate investment
of $19.1 million (net of returns). Nine of the Real Estate Ventures own nine
office buildings that contain an aggregate of approximately 1.0 million net
rentable square feet; one Real Estate Venture is developing one office building
that will contain, upon completion, an aggregate of approximately 345,000 net
rentable square feet; one Real Estate Venture is developing a hotel property
that will contain, upon completion, approximately 137 rooms; and two Real Estate
Ventures hold approximately nine acres of land for future development.

Business Objectives

The Company's business objectives are to:

   o  maximize cash flow through leasing strategies designed to capture
      potential rental growth as rental rates increase and as below-market
      leases are renewed;

   o  ensure a high tenant retention rate through aggressive tenant service
      programs responsive to the varying needs of the Company's diverse tenant
      base;

   o  increase economic diversification while maximizing economies of scale;

   o  develop high-quality office and industrial properties on the Company's
      existing inventory of land, as warranted by market conditions;

   o  capitalize on management's redevelopment expertise to selectively acquire,
      redevelop and reposition underperforming properties in desirable
      locations;

   o  acquire high-quality office and industrial properties and portfolios of
      such properties at attractive yields in selected submarkets within the
      Mid-Atlantic region that management expects will experience economic
      growth and that provide barriers to entry; and

   o  enhance the Company's investment strategy through the pursuit of joint
      venture opportunities with high-quality partners having attractive real
      estate holdings or significant financial resources.

The Company expects to continue to concentrate its real estate activities in
submarkets within the Mid-Atlantic region where it believes that: (i) barriers
to entry (such as zoning restrictions, utility availability, infrastructure
limitations, development moratoriums and limited developable land) will create
supply constraints on office and industrial space; (ii) current market rents and
absorption statistics justify limited new construction activity; (iii) it can
maximize market penetration by accumulating a critical mass of properties and
thereby enhance operating efficiencies; and (iv) there is potential for economic
growth.

Organization

The Company was organized and commenced its operations in 1986 as a Maryland
real estate investment trust. The Company owns its assets and conducts its
operations through Brandywine Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), and subsidiaries of the Operating
Partnership. As of December 31, 2001, the Company's ownership interest in the
Operating Partnership entitled it to approximately 94.3% of the Operating
Partnership's distributions after distributions by the Operating Partnership to
holders of its preferred units. The structure of the Company as an "UPREIT" is
designed, in part, to permit persons contributing properties (or interests in
properties) to the Company to defer some or all of the tax liability they might
otherwise incur in a sale of properties. The Company conducts its third-party
real estate management services through Brandywine Realty Services Corporation
(the "Management Company"), a subsidiary 95% of which is owned by the Operating
Partnership. See "Management Activities."

The Company's executive offices are located at 14 Campus Boulevard, Suite 100,
Newtown Square, Pennsylvania 19073 and its telephone number is (610) 325-5600.

Credit Facility

The Company and the Operating Partnership maintain an unsecured credit facility
(the "Credit Facility") with a bank group led by Bank of America, N.A.
comprising eighteen banks. A majority of the Company's direct and indirect
subsidiaries are parties to the Credit Facility as guarantors. The Credit
Facility provides up to $500 million in credit availability for working capital
advances and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2001, there was unused
availability of $92.3 million under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is
currently scheduled to mature in June 2004, but may be extended at the Company's
election for a period of one year upon payment of a fee equal to .25% of the
amount of the Credit Facility at the time of extension.

Advances under the Credit Facility currently bear interest at the London
Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") (1.88% at December 31, 2001) plus 1.50%. The
spread over LIBOR varies, based on the Company's leverage, from a low of 1.25%
to a high of 1.75%. The Company has the option to elect an interest rate equal
to the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus .75% or the Bank of America prime
rate plus .25%. The Company generally elects the interest rate based on LIBOR
for all or most of the Credit Facility. An alternative rate and pricing
structure is set forth in the Credit Facility if the Company or the Operating
Partnership obtains at least two investment grade debt ratings.

The Credit Facility contains provisions limiting: the incurrence of additional
debt; the granting of liens; the consummation of mergers and consolidations; the
disposition of certain assets and interests in subsidiaries; the making of
certain loans, advances and investments; and the payment of dividends. The
restriction on dividends permits the Company to pay dividends in the amount
required for it to retain its qualification as a REIT under the Code, and
otherwise limits dividends to 90% of the Company's funds from operations, as
defined in the Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility also contains financial covenants that require the Company
to maintain a debt service coverage ratio, an interest coverage ratio, a fixed
charge coverage ratio, an unsecured debt ratio and an unencumbered cash flow
ratio above certain specified minimum levels; to maintain net worth above an
amount determined on a specified formula; and to maintain a leverage ratio and a
secured debt ratio below certain maximum levels. One additional financial
covenant limits the percentage of the Company's total assets (on a consolidated
basis) that are held by subsidiaries not party to the Credit Facility.

Additional Debt

Mortgage Indebtedness. The following table sets forth information regarding the
Company's mortgage indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2001:

(a)  For loans that bear interest at a variable rate, the rates in effect at
     December 31, 2001 have been assumed to remain constant.

(b)  "Annual Debt Service" is calculated by annualizing the regularly scheduled
     principal and interest amortization.

(c)  "Annual Debt Service" for construction loans that require payment of
     interest only is calculated by annualizing the interest payment based on
     the outstanding debt balances and rates in effect at December 31, 2001.

Guaranties. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had guaranteed repayment of
approximately $2.6 million of loans on behalf of the Real Estate Ventures. The
Company selectively provides completion guaranties on behalf of Real Estate
Ventures as part of their development activities. As of December 31, 2001, the
Company was obligated on a completion guaranty in favor of a lender to one of
the Real Estate Ventures relating to construction of a development project
expected to be completed during 2002. The Company also provides customary
environmental indemnities in connection with construction and permanent
financing both for its own account and on behalf of its Real Estate Ventures.

Management Activities

The Company conducts its third-party real estate management services business
through the Management Company. As of December 31, 2001, the Management Company
was managing properties containing an aggregate of approximately 20.6 million
net rentable square feet, of which approximately 17.3 million net rentable
square feet related to Properties owned by the Company or subject to purchase
options held by the Company, and approximately 3.3 million net rentable square
feet related to properties owned by unaffiliated third parties.

Geographic Segments

The Company currently manages its portfolio within three segments: (1)
Pennsylvania, (2) New Jersey/New York and (3) Virginia. (See Note 10 to the
Financial Statements.) The Company does not have any foreign operations and its
business is not seasonal.



                                       -6-

Competition

The leasing of real estate is highly competitive. The Properties compete for
tenants with similar properties located in its markets primarily on the basis of
location, total occupancy costs (including base rent and operating expenses),
services provided, and the design and condition of the improvements. The Company
also faces competition when attempting to acquire real estate, including
competition from domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REIT's, life
insurance companies, pension funds, partnerships and individual investors.

Employees

As of December 31, 2001, the Company employed 247 persons.

Regulations

Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to the Properties and
changes in these laws and regulations or their interpretation by agencies and
the courts occur frequently. See "Risk Factors - Environmental problems at the
Properties are possible and may be costly."

Risk Factors

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a "safe harbor"
for forward-looking statements. Certain information included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K and other materials filed by the Company with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (as well as information included in oral statements or
other written statements made or to be made by the Company) contain statements
that are forward-looking, such as statements relating to business development
and real estate development activities, acquisitions, dispositions, future
capital expenditures, financing sources and availability, and the effects of
regulation (including environmental regulation) and competition. Although the
Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking
statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that
its expectations will be achieved. As forward-looking statements, these
statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from the expected results and, accordingly,
such results may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements
made by, or on behalf of, the Company. These risks, uncertainties and other
factors include uncertainties affecting real estate businesses generally (such
as entry into new leases, renewals of leases and dependence on tenants' business
operations), risks relating to the Company's ability to maintain and increase
property occupancy and rental rates, risks relating to construction and
development activities, acquisitions, dispositions, possible environmental
liabilities, risks relating to leverage and debt service (including availability
of financing on terms acceptable to the Company and sensitivity of the Company's
operations and financing arrangements to fluctuations in interest rates),
dependence on the primary markets in which the Company's Properties are located,
the existence of complex regulations relating to the Company's status as a REIT
and the adverse consequences of the Company's failure to qualify as a REIT, and
the potential adverse impact of market interest rates on the market price for
the Company's securities. The Company assumes no obligation to update or
supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent
events. The Company refers to itself as "we" or "our" in the following risk
factors.

Our operations are concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic region, and our operational
and financial performance depend on the economies in the markets in which we
have a presence; changes in such markets may adversely affect our financial
condition.

Our Properties are located in suburban markets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New
York, Virginia and Delaware. Like other real estate markets, these markets have
experienced economic downturns in the past, and they are currently experiencing
such a downturn similar to the broader economic slowdown in the U.S. Such
slowdowns can lead companies to lay off employees, which might cause them to

                                       -7-
<PAGE>


require less office space. They can also result in companies experiencing
difficulty with their cash flow, which might cause them to delay or miss making
their lease payments. Declines in the economies of any of these real estate
markets could adversely affect our operations or cash flow and ability to make
distributions to shareholders.

Our financial performance will be particularly sensitive to the economic
conditions in these markets. Our revenues and the value of our Properties may be
adversely affected by a number of factors, including the economic climate in
these markets (which may be adversely impacted by reductions in the employee
workforce, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors) and real
estate conditions in these markets (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for
office and industrial properties, including oversupply from space available for
sublease). Slower economic conditions might also cause tenants to make their
lease payments late. Furthermore, the sluggish climate might affect the timing
of lease commitments by new tenants or of lease renewals by existing tenants as
such parties delay or defer their leasing decisions to get the most current
information possible about trends in their businesses or industries. These
factors, when and if they occur in the areas in which our Properties are
located, would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions
to shareholders.

Financially distressed tenants may limit our ability to realize the value of our
investments.

Following a tenant's lease default, we may experience delays in enforcing our
rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our
investment and recovering lease and other payments owed to us. In addition, a
tenant may seek bankruptcy law protection, which could relieve the tenant from
its obligation to make lease payments.

We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.

If tenants fail to renew their leases upon expiration, we may be unable to relet
the subject space. Even if the tenants do renew their leases or we can relet the
space, the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of required
renovations) may be less favorable than current lease terms. Certain leases
grant the tenants an early termination right upon payment of a termination
penalty. While we have estimated our expenditures for new and renewal leases for
2002 and 2003, we cannot be assured as to the accuracy of such estimates.

New development and acquisitions may not produce results in accordance with our
expectations and may require development and renovation costs exceeding our
estimates.

Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our
expectations. Our actual renovation and improvement costs in bringing an
acquired property up to market standards may exceed our estimates.

In addition, we are active in developing and redeveloping office properties.
Risks associated with these activities include:

     o    the unavailability of favorable financing, including permanent
          financing to repay construction financing;

     o    construction costs exceeding original estimates;

     o    construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service
          and construction costs;

     o    complications in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other
          governmental permits; and

     o    insufficient occupancy levels and rental rates at a newly completed
          property causing the property to be unprofitable.

                                      -8-

Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss
insurance on all of our Properties. We believe the policy specifications and
insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate. There are,
however, types of losses, such as lease and other contract claims, that
generally are not insured.

As a consequence of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we may be unable
to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts. In
addition, insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types
of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold, or, if offered,
these types of insurance may be prohibitively expensive. Should an uninsured
loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion
of the capital we have invested in a Property, as well as the anticipated future
revenue from the Property. In such an event, we might nevertheless remain
obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the
Property. We cannot be assured that material losses in excess of insurance
proceeds will not occur in the future. If any of our Properties were to
experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay
revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the Property. Such
events could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to
shareholders.

We face significant competition from other real estate developers.

We compete with real estate developers, operators and institutions for tenants
and acquisition and development opportunities. Some of these competitors have
significantly greater financial resources than we do. Such competition may
reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us, interfere
with our ability to attract and retain tenants and may increase vacancies, which
increases supply and lowers market rental rates, reduces our bargaining leverage
and adversely affects our ability to improve our operating leverage. We cannot
be assured that this competition will not adversely affect our cash flow and
ability to make distributions to shareholders.

Because real estate is illiquid, we may not be able to sell Properties when
appropriate.

Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to
vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") limits our ability to
sell properties held for fewer than four years. Purchase options and rights of
first refusal held by certain tenants may also limit our ability to sell certain
properties. Any of these factors could adversely affect our cash flow and
ability to make distributions to shareholders as well as the ability of someone
to purchase us, even if a purchase were in our shareholders' best interests.

We have agreed not to sell certain of our Properties.

We have agreed with the former owners of 74 of our Properties aggregating
approximately 4.3 million net rentable square feet not to sell these Properties
for varying periods of time in transactions that would trigger taxable income to
the former owners, subject to certain exceptions. Some of these agreements are
with affiliates of current trustees of our company. In addition, we may enter
into similar agreements with sellers of Properties bought by us in the future.
These agreements generally provide that we may dispose of the applicable
Properties in transactions that qualify as tax-free exchanges under Section 1031
of the Code or in other tax deferred transactions. Therefore, without suffering
adverse financial consequences, we may be precluded from selling certain
Properties other than in transactions that would qualify as tax-free exchanges
for federal income tax purposes.

Our operating costs might rise, which might reduce our profitability and have an
adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to
shareholders.

We might face higher operating expenses as a result of rising costs generally
and following the terrorist attacks in the U.S. on September 11, 2001 in
particular. For example, it might cost more in the future than in the past for
building security, property/casualty and liability insurance, and property
maintenance.

                                      -9-
<PAGE>


Following the September 11 attacks, we have increased the level of security at
our Properties. We might not be able to pass along the increased costs
associated with such increased building security to our tenants, which could
reduce our profitability and cash flow. Our existing insurance policies expire
in June 2002. As a result of the terrorist attacks, the cost of premiums for
comparable coverage might be significantly higher when it is time to renew our
coverage, which could increase our operating expenses and reduce our
profitability and our cash flow. Because of rising costs in general, we might
experience increases in our property maintenance costs, such as for cleaning,
electricity, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning. In general, under
our leases with tenants, we pass on a portion of these costs to them. We cannot
be assured, however, that tenants will actually bear the full burden of these
higher costs, or that such increased costs will not lead them, or other
prospective tenants, to seek office space elsewhere. If operating expenses
increase, the availability of other comparable office space in our specific
geographic markets might limit our ability to increase rents, which could reduce
our profitability (if operating expenses increase without a corresponding
increase in revenues) and limit our ability to make distributions to
shareholders.

Our ability to make distributions is subject to various risks.

We have been paying quarterly distributions to our shareholders. Our ability to
make distributions in the future will depend upon:

     o    the operational and financial performance of our Properties;

     o    capital expenditures with respect to existing and newly acquired
          Properties;

     o    the amount of, and the interest rates on, our debt; and

     o    the absence of significant expenditures relating to environmental and
          other regulatory matters.

Certain of these matters are beyond our control and any significant difference
between our expectations and actual results could have a material adverse effect
on our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to shareholders.

Changes in the law may adversely affect our cash flow.

Because increases in income and service taxes are generally not passed through
to tenants under leases, such increases may adversely affect our cash flow and
ability to make expected distributions to shareholders. The Properties are also
subject to various regulatory requirements, such as those relating to fire and
safety. Our failure to comply with these requirements could result in the
imposition of fines and damage awards. Also, the costs to comply with any new or
different regulations could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to
make distributions. While we believe that the Properties are currently in
material compliance with all such requirements, we cannot be assured that these
requirements will not change or that newly imposed requirements will not require
significant unanticipated expenditures.

Our indebtedness subjects us to additional risks.

Debt Financing and Existing Debt Maturities. Like other real estate companies,
we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, such as the
insufficiency of cash flow to meet required debt service payment obligations and
the inability to refinance existing indebtedness. If our debt cannot be paid,
refinanced or extended at maturity, in addition to our failure to repay our
debt, we may not be able to make distributions to shareholders at expected
levels or at all. Furthermore, an increase in our interest expense could
adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to
shareholders. If we do not meet our debt service obligations, any Properties
securing such indebtedness could be foreclosed on, which would have a material
adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to make distributions and, depending
on the number of Properties foreclosed on, could threaten our continued
viability.

                                      -10-
<PAGE>


Risk of Rising Interest Rates and Variable Rate Debt. Increases in interest
rates on variable rate indebtedness would increase our interest expense, which
could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to
shareholders.

No Limitation on Debt. Our organizational documents do not contain any
limitation on our ability to incur additional debt. Accordingly, we could
increase our outstanding debt without restriction. The increased debt service
could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions and could
increase the risk of default on our indebtedness.

Environmental problems at the Properties are possible and may be costly.

Federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations may require a current
or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up
hazardous or toxic substances or releases at such property. The owner or
operator may be forced to pay for property damage and for investigation and
clean-up costs incurred by others in connection with environmental
contamination. Such laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability
without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence
of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for
the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held
responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties
may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from
environmental contamination emanating from that site. These costs may be
substantial and the presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner's
ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as
collateral.

Independent environmental consultants have conducted a standard Phase I or
similar general environmental site assessment ("ESA") of each of our Properties
to identify potential sources of environmental contamination and assess
environmental regulatory compliance. For a number of the Properties, the Phase I
ESA either referenced a prior Phase II ESA obtained on such Property or prompted
us to have a Phase II ESA of such Property conducted. A Phase II ESA generally
involves invasive procedures, such as soil sampling and testing or the
installation and monitoring of groundwater wells. While the ESAs conducted have
identified environmental contamination on a few of the Properties, they have not
revealed any environmental contamination, liability or compliance concern that
we believe would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow or ability to
make distributions to shareholders.

It is possible that the existing ESAs relating to the Properties do not reveal
all environmental contaminations, liabilities or compliance concerns which
currently exist, and it is also possible that the cost of remediating identified
contamination may exceed current estimates. In addition, future properties which
we acquire may be subject to environmental conditions.

By holding Properties through the Operating Partnership and various joint
ventures, we are exposed to additional risks.

We own the Properties and interests in Real Estate Ventures through the
Operating Partnership. In the future, we expect to continue to participate with
other entities in property ownership through joint ventures or partnerships.
Partnership or joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present
in direct investments. Such risks include:

     o    the potential bankruptcy of our partners or co-venturers;

     o    a conflict between our business goals and those of our partners or
          co-venturers; and

     o    actions taken by our partners or co-venturers contrary to our
          instructions or objectives.

There is no limitation under our organizational documents as to the amount of
funds which we may invest in partnerships or joint ventures.

                                      -11-

Our status as a REIT is dependent on compliance with federal income tax
requirements.

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences to our
shareholders. We believe that since 1986, we have qualified for taxation as a
REIT for federal income tax purposes. We plan to continue to meet the
requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements are highly
technical and complex. The determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis
of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within our
control. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income
must come from certain sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. We are
also required to distribute to shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable
income (excluding net capital gains). The fact that we hold our assets through
the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the
application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake
could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might change
the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings that make
it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT. We do
not believe, however, that any pending or proposed tax law changes would
jeopardize our REIT status.

To maintain REIT status, a REIT may not own more than 10% of the stock of any
corporation, except for a qualified REIT subsidiary (which must be wholly-owned
by the REIT), taxable REIT subsidiary or another REIT.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax at
regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain
statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years
following the year we first failed to qualify. If we failed to qualify as a
REIT, we would be required to pay significant income taxes and would, therefore,
have less money available for investments or for distributions to shareholders.
This would likely have a material adverse effect on the value of our securities.
In addition, we would no longer be required to make any distributions to
shareholders.

In order to make the distributions required to maintain our REIT status, we may
need to borrow funds. To obtain the favorable tax treatment associated with REIT
qualification, we generally will be required to distribute to shareholders at
least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains). In
addition, we will be subject to tax on our undistributed net taxable income and
net capital gain and a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by
which certain distributions paid by us with respect to any calendar year are
less than the sum of 85% of ordinary income plus 95% of capital gain net income
for the calendar year, plus certain undistributed amounts from prior years.

We intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the distribution
provisions of the Code and to avoid income and other taxes. Our income will
consist primarily of our share of the income of the Operating Partnership and
our cash flow will consist primarily of our share of distributions from the
Operating Partnership. Differences in timing between the receipt of income and
the payment of expenses in arriving at taxable income (of the Company or the
Operating Partnership) and the effect of required debt amortization payments
could require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis or to liquidate funds on
adverse terms to meet the REIT qualification distribution requirements.

Failure of the Operating Partnership (or a subsidiary partnership) to be treated
as a partnership would have serious adverse consequences to our shareholders. If
the IRS were to successfully challenge the tax status of the Operating
Partnership or any of its subsidiary partnerships for federal income tax
purposes, the Operating Partnership or the affected subsidiary partnership would
be taxable as a corporation. In such event, we would cease to qualify as a REIT
and the imposition of a corporate tax on the Operating Partnership or a
subsidiary partnership would reduce the amount of cash available for
distribution from such partnership to us and our shareholders.

We do pay some taxes. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we are required to pay
certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and Properties. In
addition, the Management Company is subject to federal, state and local income
tax at regular corporate rates on its net taxable income derived from its
management, leasing and related service business. If we have net income from a
prohibited transaction, such income will be subject to a 100% tax.

                                      -12-
<PAGE>


We own a subsidiary REIT. One of our subsidiaries, Atlantic American Properties
Trust ("AAPT"), that indirectly holds 24 of the Properties, elected to be taxed
as a REIT for the year ended December 31, 1997. So long as we seek to maintain
AAPT's REIT status, AAPT will be subject to all the requirements and risks
associated with maintaining REIT status summarized above, including the
limitation on the ownership of more than 10% of the securities of any
corporation (other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, taxable REIT subsidiary or
another REIT).

We are dependent upon our key personnel.

We are dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers, particularly Gerard
H. Sweeney. The loss of Mr. Sweeney's services could have an adverse affect on
our operations and would entitle the banks under our Credit Facility to
accelerate the amounts due thereunder. Although we have an employment agreement
with Mr. Sweeney for a term extending to December 31, 2003, this agreement does
not restrict his ability to become employed by a competitor following the
termination of his employment with us. We do not have keyman life insurance
coverage for Mr. Sweeney.

Certain limitations exist with respect to a third party's ability to acquire us
or effectuate a change in control.

Limitations imposed to protect our REIT status. In order to protect us against
loss of our REIT status, our Declaration of Trust limits any shareholder from
owning more than 9.8% in value of our outstanding shares, subject to certain
exceptions. The ownership limit may have the effect of precluding acquisition of
control of the Company. If anyone acquires shares in excess of the ownership
limit, we may:

     o    consider the transfer to be null and void;

     o    not reflect the transaction on our books;

     o    institute legal action to stop the transaction;

     o    not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares;

     o    not recognize any voting rights for those shares; and

     o    consider the shares held in trust for the benefit of a person to whom
          such shares may be transferred.

Limitation due to our ability to issue preferred shares. Our Declaration of
Trust authorizes the Board of Trustees to issue preferred shares. The Board of
Trustees may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued
which could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking
control of us, even if a change in control were in our shareholders' best
interests.

Limitations imposed by the Business Combination Law. The Maryland General
Corporation Law, as applicable to Maryland real estate investment trusts,
establishes special restrictions against "business combinations" between a
Maryland real estate investment trust and "interested shareholders" or their
affiliates unless an exemption is applicable. An interested shareholder includes
a person who beneficially owns, and an affiliate or associate of the trust who,
at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the
beneficial owner of, ten percent or more of the voting power of our
then-outstanding voting shares. Among other things, the law prohibits (for a
period of five years) a merger and certain other transactions between the trust
and an interested shareholder unless the Board of Trustees approved the
transaction before the party became an interested shareholder. The five-year
period runs from the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became
an interested shareholder. Thereafter, any such business combination must be
recommended by the Board of Trustees and approved by two super-majority
shareholder votes unless, among other conditions, the trust's common
shareholders receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is
received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested
shareholder for its shares or unless the Board of Trustees approved the
transaction before the party in question became an interested shareholder. The
business combination statute could have the effect of discouraging offers to
acquire us and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers,

                                      -13-

<PAGE>


even if our acquisition would be in our shareholders' best interests. We have
exempted any business combination involving Safeguard Scientifics, Inc., the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System and a voting
trust established for its benefit, Morgan Stanley Asset Management Inc. and two
funds managed by it, Lazard Freres Real Estate Investors, L.L.C., Five Arrows
Realty Securities III L.L.C., Gerard H. Sweeney (the Company's President and
Chief Executive Officer) and any of their respective affiliates or associates.

Many factors can have an adverse effect on the market value of our securities.

Like any publicly traded company, a number of factors might adversely affect the
price of our securities, many of which are beyond our control. These factors
include:

     o    Increases in market interest rates, relative to the dividend yield on
          our shares. If market interest rates go up, prospective purchasers of
          our securities may require a higher yield. Higher market interest
          rates would not, however, result in more funds for us to distribute
          and, to the contrary, would likely increase our borrowing costs and
          potentially decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher
          market interest rates could cause the market price of our common
          shares to go down.

     o    Anticipated benefit of an investment in our securities as compared to
          investment in securities of companies in other industries.

     o    Perception by market professionals of REITs generally and REITs
          comparable to us in particular.

     o    Perception by market participants of our potential for payment of cash
          distributions and for growth.

     o    Level of institutional investor interest in our securities.

     o    Relatively low trading volumes in securities of REITs.

     o    Our results of operations and financial condition.

The issuance of Preferred Shares may adversely affect the rights of holders of
Common Shares.

Because the Board of Trustees has the power to establish the preferences and
rights of each class or series of Preferred Shares, it may afford the holders in
any series or class of preferred shares preferences, distributions, powers and
rights, voting or otherwise, senior to the rights of holders of Common Shares.

(a)  Calculated by dividing net rentable square feet included in leases signed
     on or before December 31, 2001 at the property by the aggregate net
     rentable square feet of the Property.

(b)  "Total Base Rent" for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 represents
     base rents received during such period, excluding tenant reimbursements,
     calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
     (GAAP) determined on a straight-line basis. Tenant reimbursements generally
     include payment of real estate taxes, operating expenses and common area
     maintenance and utility charges.

(c)  "Average Annualized Rental Rate" is calculated as follows: (i) for office
     leases written on a triple net basis, the sum of the annualized contracted
     base rental rates payable for all space leased as of December 31, 2001
     (without giving effect to free rent or scheduled rent increases that would
     be taken into account under GAAP) plus the 2001 budgeted operating expenses
     excluding tenant electricity; and (ii) for office leases written on a full
     service basis, the annualized contracted base rent payable for all space
     leased as of December 31, 2001. In both cases the annualized rental rate is
     divided by the total square footage leased as of December 31, 2001 without
     giving effect to free rent or scheduled rent increases that would be taken
     into account under GAAP.

(d)  "Total Base Rent" reflected for these Properties is presented on a
     consolidated basis.

(e)  These Properties are under redevelopment and are excluded from the
     percentages for Weighted Average Percentage Leased and Average Annualized
     Rental Rate information.

(f)  This Property is subject to a ground lease.

The following table shows certain information regarding rental rates and lease
expirations for the Properties at December 31, 2001, assuming none of the
tenants exercises renewal options or termination rights, if any, at or prior to
scheduled expirations:

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved from time to time in litigation on various matters,
which include disputes with tenants and disputes arising out of agreements to
purchase or sell properties. Given the nature of the Company's business
activities, these lawsuits are considered routine to the conduct of its
business. The result of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted, because of
the very nature of litigation, the litigation process and its adversarial
nature, and the jury system.

Reference is made to the litigation disclosed in Part II, Item 1 of the
Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000. On July 9, 1999, the
Superior Court of New Jersey, Camden County, dismissed the complaint against the
Company with prejudice. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for
reconsideration, which motion the Superior Court denied. Plaintiffs then
appealed to the Appellate Division, which is the intermediate appellate level
court in New Jersey. In December 2000, the Appellate Division affirmed in part
and reversed in part the Chancery Division's earlier dismissal of the entire
action. The Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal of the fraud and other
non-contractual counts in the Complaint, but reversed the contract and
reformation counts and remanded these to the lower court for further
proceedings. The Company sought review of this decision by the Supreme Court of
New Jersey, but in March 2001, that Court declined to consider the appeal. The
case has therefore returned to the Chancery Division, where it is now in the
written discovery stage.

In November 1999, a third-party complaint was filed in the Superior Court of New
Jersey, Burlington County, by BRI OP Limited Partnership ("BRI OP") against the
Company and several other persons and entities, including several former
affiliates of the Company, relative to Greentree Shopping Center located in
Marlton, New Jersey ("Subject Property"). The Subject Property was owned and
managed by a subsidiary of the Company between 1986 and 1988. BRI OP, also a
former owner of the Subject Property, has been sued by the present owner and
manager ("Owner") of the Subject Property, seeking indemnification and
contribution for costs related to the remediation of environmental contamination
allegedly caused by a dry cleaning business, which was a tenant of the Subject
Property. BRI OP, in turn, brought a third-party action against the Company and
others seeking indemnification for environmental remediation and clean up costs
for which it may be held liable. During the course of the proceeding, the Owner
petitioned the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP") to
issue a directive to clean up the Subject Property to certain parties, including
the Company, BRI OP and the dry cleaner, who were allegedly responsible for the
environmental contamination under the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control
Act ("Spill Act"). NJDEP issued such a directive to those parties and the Owner
in May 2001 (the "Directive") which requires all of the parties to the Directive
to remediate the Subject Property. Failure to comply with a Spill Act directive
would subject a noncomplying party to treble damages (i.e., triple the cost of
the cleanup if performed by NJDEP or others ) and, potentially, penalties under
the Spill Act.

Following issuance of the Directive, the parties to whom the Directive was
issued commenced settlement negotiations. The negotiations resulted in an
agreement in principle between the Company, BRI OP and the Owner, which the
parties are in the process of reducing to writing. Under the settlement, the
Owner would perform and obtain NJDEP approval of the cleanup and release and
indemnify (with limited exceptions) the Company and BRI OP from and against
liability for matters relating to the contamination. The Company believes that
the agreement reached with the Owner, upon finalization and implementation, will
also satisfy its obligation to participate in the remediation pursuant to the
Directive; however, the Company has not yet confirmed this with the NJDEP
(although it intends to do so upon finalization of the settlement). The Company
believes that, regardless of whether the Superior Court action is settled or the
Company is relieved of further responsibility under the Directive, based on its
assessment of the estimated cost of any required remediation, the availability
of other parties that are potentially responsible for all or a portion of such
cost, and defenses that may be available to the Company, that this matter will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements appearing elsewhere herein. The results of operations, liquidity and
capital resources and cash flows of the Company include the historical results
of operations of the Properties held by the Company during the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains
forward-looking statements for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as such may involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance
or achievements of the Company to be materially different from future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in
such forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, there can
be no assurance that these expectations will be realized. See Item 1. Business -
Risk Factors.

OVERVIEW

The Company currently manages its portfolio within three geographic segments:
(1) Pennsylvania, (2) New Jersey/New York and (3) Virginia. The Company believes
it has established an effective platform in these office and industrial markets
that provides a foundation for achieving its goals of maximizing market
penetration and optimizing operating economies of scale.

During 2001, the Company sold three office and eight industrial properties,
containing 440,000 net rentable square feet, and four parcels of land,
containing 15.8 acres, for $31.3 million. The Company also acquired two office
properties, containing 146,000 net rentable square feet, and three parcels of
land, containing 30.0 acres, for $31.5 million. In addition to these sales and
acquisitions, the Company consumated an exchange of properties with Prentiss
Properties Acquisition Partners, L.P. ("Prentiss") during the second quarter of
2001. The Company acquired from Prentiss 30 properties (29 office and one
industrial) containing 1.6 million net rentable square feet and 6.9 acres of
land for total consideration of $215.2 million. The Company conveyed to Prentiss
four office properties located in Northern Virginia that contain an aggregate of
657,000 net rentable square feet, assumed $79.7 million of mortgage debt secured
by certain of the Prentiss properties, issued a $7.8 million promissory note,
paid $15.9 million at closing and agreed to make additional payments totaling
$7.0 million (including $5.4 million of payments discounted at 7.5%) over a
three year period subsequent to closing. The Company also contributed to
Prentiss its interest in a real estate venture that owns two additional office
properties that contain an aggregate of 452,000 net rentable square feet and
received a combination of preferred and common units of limited partnership
interest in Prentiss having a value, as of closing, of $10.7 million. In
addition, as part of the Prentiss transaction, in June 2001, the Company
purchased a 103,000 square foot building under construction and six acres of
related developable land for $9.9 million.

The Company receives income primarily from rental revenue (including tenant
reimbursements) from the Properties and, to a lesser extent, from the management
of certain properties owned by third parties and from investments in the Real
Estate Ventures. The Company expects that revenue growth in the next two years
will result primarily from rent increases in its current portfolio and the
development or redevelopment of office properties. As of December 31, 2001, the
Company had five buildings in development or redevelopment aggregating 580,000
square feet.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations discusses the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on
historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. On an on-going basis, management
evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to bad debts,
capitalization of costs, contingencies and litigation. Actual results may differ
from those estimates.

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more
significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of it financial
statements:

Revenue Recognition
-------------------
Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term
regardless of when payments are due. Certain lease agreements contain provisions
that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and
certain common area maintenance costs.

Real Estate Investments
-----------------------
Real estate investments are carried at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the useful lives of buildings and capital improvements
(25 to 40 years) and over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset
for tenant improvements. Direct construction costs related to the development of
certain Properties and land holdings are capitalized as incurred. The Company
expenses routine repair and maintenance expenditures.


                                      -32-
<PAGE>


Real Estate Ventures
--------------------
The Company accounts for its non-controlling interests in Real Estate Ventures
using the equity method. These investments, initially recorded at cost, are
subsequently adjusted for the Company's net equity in the venture's income or
loss and cash contributions and distributions.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
------------------------------
Management reviews investments in real estate and real estate ventures for
impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such
assets may not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss will be based
on the fair value of the asset; determined using customary valuation techniques,
such as the present value of expected future cash flows.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
-------------------------------
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents an
estimate of losses that may be incurred from the inability of tenants to make
required payments. The allowance is an estimate based on two calculations that
are combined to determine the total amount reserved. First, the Company
evaluates specific accounts where it has been determined that a tenant may have
an inability to meet its financial obligations. In these situations, the Company
uses its judgment, based on the facts and circumstances, and records a specific
reserve for that tenant against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the
amount that the Company expects to collect. These reserves are reevaluated and
adjusted as additional information becomes available. Second, a reserve is
established for all tenants based on a range of percentages applied to aging
categories. These percentages are based on historical collection and write-off
experience. If the financial condition of the Company's tenants were to
deteriorate, additional allowances may be required.

Marketable Securities
---------------------
The Company accounts for its investments in equity securities according to the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS 115"),
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, which requires
securities classified as "available-for-sale" to be stated at fair value.
Adjustments to fair value of available-for-sale securities are recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income in beneficiaries' equity. The Company
records an investment impairment charge when an investment has experienced a
decline in value that management believes to be other than temporary.

Deferred Costs
--------------
The Company incurs direct costs related to the financing and leasing of the
Properties. Management is required to use professional judgment in determining
whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed.
Capitalized financing fees are amortized over the related loan term and
capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the related lease term.

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
------------------------------------------------------------
The Company measures every derivative instrument (including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts) at fair value and records them in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability. For derivatives designated as
fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument
and the hedged item are recorded in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash
flow hedges, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the
derivative are reported in other comprehensive income. Changes in fair value of
derivative instruments and ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in
earnings in the current period.

                                      -33-
<PAGE>


The Company formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an on-going
basis, whether each derivative is highly-effective in offsetting changes in fair
values of cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative
is not highly-effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a
highly-effective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting
prospectively.

The Company manages its ratio of fixed-to-floating rate debt with the objective
of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To manage this mix
in a cost-effective manner, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest
rate swap agreements, in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of
fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts. As
of December 31, 2001, the maximum length of time which the Company is hedging
its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions
is through June 2004. There was no gain or loss reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income into earnings during 2001 as a result of the
discontinuance of a cash flow hedge due to the probability of the original
forecasted transaction not occurring.

Legal Contingencies
-------------------
The Company is involved from time to time in litigation on various matters,
including disputes with tenants and disputes arising out of agreements to
purchase or sell properties. Given the nature of the Company's business
activities, these lawsuits are considered to be routine to the conduct of its
business. The result of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted, because of
the very nature of litigation, the litigation process and its adversarial
nature, and the jury system.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In 2000, the Operating Partnership held a 95% economic interest in Brandywine
Realty Services Corporation (the "Management Company") through its ownership of
100% of the Management Company's non-voting preferred stock and 5% of its voting
common stock. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company converted its non-voting
equity interest in the Management Company to a voting interest. Accordingly, the
Company owns 95% of the equity of and has voting control over the Management
Company. Therefore, the 2001 financial results of the Management Company have
been consolidated. For purposes of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the 2000 and 1999 results of
operations presented below have been restated to reflect this presentation.

The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 include
the respective operations of the Properties. Of the 270 Properties owned by the
Company as of December 31, 2001, a total of 224 Properties containing an
aggregate of 14.8 million net rentable square feet ("Same Store Properties")
were owned for the entire twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.
The following table set forth revenue and expense information as to these Same

Property NOI                     $ 157,133  $ 154,716   $  2,417       1.6%

Revenue increased to $310.8 million for 2001 as compared to $291.5 million for
2000, primarily due to increased rental rates and additional properties in 2001,
offset by decreased occupancy. The straight-line rent adjustment increased
revenues by $6.2 million in 2001 and $6.4 million in 2000. Average occupancy
decreased to 94.5% in 2001 as compared to 95.0% for 2000. Revenue for Same Store
Properties increased to $254.6 million in 2001 from $247.3 million in 2000. This
increase was the result of increased rental rates offset by a slight decrease in
occupancy in 2001 as compared to 2000. Average occupancy for the Same Store
Properties decreased to 95.1% in 2001 from 95.3% in 2000. Other income
represents lease termination fees, leasing commissions, third-party management
fees and interest income. Other income decreased to $10.8 million in 2001 from
$11.6 million in 2000 primarily due to additional interest income earned in 2000
on deposits made to acquire properties.

<PAGE>

Property operating expenses increased to $80.5 million in 2001 as compared to
$71.4 million in 2000, primarily due to increased utilities expense, increased
provision for doubtful accounts and additional properties in 2001. Property
operating expenses included a provision for doubtful accounts of $2.9 million in
2001 and $332,000 in 2000 to provide for increased credit risk related to
certain tenants. Property operating expenses for the Same Store Properties
increased to $73.5 million in 2001 as compared to $69.4 million in 2000 as a
result of higher utility expenses, increased repairs and maintenance costs and
increased property management charges.

Real estate taxes increased to $27.8 million in 2001 as compared to $26.2
million in 2000, primarily due to increased real estate tax assessments in 2001
and additional properties in 2001. Real estate taxes for the Same Store
Properties increased to $23.9 million in 2001 as compared to $23.2 million in
2000 as a result of higher tax rates and property assessments.

Interest expense increased to $66.4 million in 2001 as compared to $64.8 million
in 2000, primarily due to increased average borrowings resulting from the
Prentiss transaction in 2001, partially offset by decreased interest rates.
Average outstanding debt balances for 2001 were $949.5 million as compared to
$871.3 million for 2000. The Company's weighted-average interest rate after
giving effect to hedging activities on unsecured credit facilities decreased to
6.48% in 2001 from 7.84% in 2000 and on mortgage notes payable decreased to
7.39% in 2001 from 7.92% in 2000.

Depreciation increased to $73.0 million in 2001 as compared to $64.6 million in
2000 primarily due to additional properties in 2001. Amortization, related to
deferred leasing costs, increased to $5.2 million in 2001 as compared to $3.0
million in 2000, primarily due to increased leasing activity and additional
properties in 2001.

Administrative expenses increased to $15.2 million in 2001 as compared to $14.2
million in 2000, primarily due to amortization of deferred compensation costs
related to additional restricted Common Shares awarded in 2001.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $6.6 million
non-recurring charge related to the change in employment status of the Company's
Chairman to a non-executive, non-managerial status and the write-down of the
Company's $2.5 million investment in a telecommunications company that was
deemed to be other than temporary. The $4.1 million charge related to the
Company's Chairman reflects an accrual on account of payment obligations of the
Company under its employment agreement with the Chairman, accelerated vesting of
his restricted shares and restructuring of his executive stock loan.

Equity in income of Real Estate Ventures was $2.8 million in 2001 and 2000. The
income attributable to two ventures sold in 2001 was offset by four ventures
commencing operations in 2001.

During 2001, the Company sold three office properties, eight industrial
properties and four land parcels for $31.3 million, realizing a net gain of $4.5
million. During 2000, the Company sold seven office properties and two land
parcels for $101.1 million, realizing a net gain of $11.6 million.

Minority interest represents the equity in income attributable to the portion of
the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company. Minority interest decreased
to $8.6 million in 2001 as compared to $9.6 million in 2000, primarily due to
the $6.6 million non-recurring charge in 2001.

</TABLE>

Revenue increased to $291.5 million for 2000 as compared to $286.8 million for
1999, primarily due to increased rental rates and occupancy, partially offset by
property dispositions in 2000. The straight-line rent adjustment increased
revenues by $6.4 million in 2000 and $8.1 million in 1999. Average occupancy
increased to 95.0% in 2000 as compared to 93.6% for 1999.

Property operating expenses increased to $71.4 million in 2000 as compared to
$71.3 million in 1999, primarily due to the start-up of e-Tenants.com in 2000.
e-Tenants is a web-based service owned by the Company that provides tenants with
comprehensive business-to-business, business-to-consumer and on-line work order
placement capabilities.

Real estate taxes increased to $26.2 million in 2000 as compared to $25.5
million in 1999, primarily due to increased real estate tax assessments in 2000,
partially offset by property dispositions in 2000.

Interest expense decreased to $64.8 million in 2000 as compared to $69.8 million
in 1999, primarily due to decreased average borrowings resulting from property
dispositions in 2000, partially offset by increased interest rates. Average
outstanding debt balances for 2000 were $871.3 million as compared to $927.3
million for 1999. The Company's weighted-average interest rate on unsecured
credit facilities increased to 7.84% in 2000 from 6.95% in 1999 and on mortgage
notes payable increased to 7.92% in 2000 from 7.1% in 1999.

Depreciation decreased to $64.6 million in 2000 as compared to $67.1 million in
1999 primarily due to property dispositions in 2000. Amortization, related to
deferred leasing costs, increased to $3.0 million in 2000 as compared to $2.8
million in 1999, primarily due to increased leasing activity.

Administrative expenses increased to $14.2 million in 2000 as compared to $11.7
million in 1999, primarily due to amortization of deferred compensation costs
related to additional restricted Common Shares awarded in 2000 and a
compensation accrual for loans made to executives to purchase Common Shares
which will be forgiven over a three year period.

Equity in income of Real Estate Ventures increased to $2.8 million in 2000 as
compared to $1.0 million in 1999, primarily due to an increase in the number of
ventures commencing operations.

During 2000, the Company sold seven office properties and two land parcels for
$101.1 million, realizing a net gain of $11.6 million. During 1999, the Company
sold seven office properties and 20 industrial facilities, realizing a net gain
of $3.1 million.

Minority interest represents the equity in income attributable to the portion of
the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company. Minority interest increased
to $9.6 million in 2000 as compared to $8.0 million in 1999, primarily due to
the allocation of the net gain from sales of property in 2000.

Capitalization

At December 31, 2001, the Company maintained a $500.0 million Credit Facility.
(See Item 1. Business-Credit Facility)

As of December 31, 2001, the Company had approximately $1.0 billion of debt
outstanding, consisting of $394.3 million of borrowings under the Credit
Facility and $614.8 million of mortgage notes payable. The mortgage notes
payable consists of $526.2 million of fixed rate loans and $88.6 million of
variable rate loans. Additionally, the Company has entered into interest rate
swap and cap agreements to fix the interest rate on $278.0 million of the Credit
Facility and variable rate loans. The mortgage loans mature between February
2003 and July 2027. As of December 31, 2001, the Company also had $13.4 million
of letters-of-credit outstanding under the Credit Facility and $92.3 million of
unused availability under the Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31,
2001, the weighted-average interest rate under the Company's Credit Facility was

The Company intends to refinance its mortgage notes payable as they become due
repay them if they relate to properties being sold. The Company expects to
renegotiate its Credit Facility or extend its term for an additional year.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company's debt-to-market capitalization ratio was
50.4%. As a general policy, the Company intends, but is not obligated, to adhere
to a policy of maintaining a long-term average debt-to-market capitalization
ratio of no more than 50%.

The Company's Board of Trustees approved a share repurchase program authorizing
the Company to repurchase up to 4,000,000 of its outstanding Common Shares.
During 2001, the Company repurchased 302,437 Common Shares (net of 71,276 Common
Shares purchased and re-issued under the employee loan share program) for an
aggregate of $5.9 million (an average price of $19.54 per share). The Company
may purchase an additional 1.3 million Common Shares under this program. No time
limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program.

Short- and Long-Term Liquidity

The Company believes that cash flow from operations and current financing
alternatives are adequate to fund its short-term liquidity requirements for
2002. Cash flow from operations is generated primarily from rental revenues,
operating expense reimbursements from tenants, and provision of management
services to third parties. The Company intends to use these funds to meet its
principal short-term liquidity needs, which are to fund operating expenses, debt
service requirements, recurring capital expenditures, tenant allowances, leasing
commissions and the minimum distributions required to maintain the Company's
REIT qualifications under the Internal Revenue Code.

On December 12, 2001, the Board of Trustees declared a quarterly dividend
distribution of $0.44 per share, paid on January 15, 2002 to shareholders of
record as of December 31, 2001. Distributions declared in 2001 totaled $1.70 per
share as compared to $1.62 per share in 2000, representing an increase of
approximately 4.9%.

The Company expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as for
property acquisitions, development, investments in real estate ventures,
scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other significant
capital improvements, through borrowings under its Credit Facility, long-term
secured and unsecured indebtedness, the issuance of equity securities and the
disposition of certain properties.

Funds from Operations

Management considers Funds from Operations ("FFO") as one measure of REIT
performance. FFO is calculated as net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation
expense attributable to real property, amortization expense attributable to
capitalized leasing costs, gains(losses) on sales of land interests, and
extraordinary items and comparable adjustments for real estate ventures
accounted for using the equity method. Management believes that FFO is a useful
disclosure in the real estate industry; however, the Company's disclosure may
not be comparable to other REITs'. FFO should not be considered an alternative
to net income as an indication of the Company's operating performance or to
operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

Inflation

A majority of the Company's leases provide for escalations of real estate taxes
and operating expenses either on a triple net basis or over a base amount. In
addition, many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or
indexed escalations (based on the CPI or other measure). The Company believes
that inflationary increases in expenses will be significantly offset by expense
reimbursement and contractual rent increases.

Interest Rate Risk and Sensitivity Analysis

The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Company's
financial instruments to selected changes in market rates. The range of changes
chosen reflects the Company's view of changes which are reasonably possible over
a one-year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash
flows based on the market rates chosen.

The Company's financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate
debt. As of December 31, 2001, the Company's consolidated debt consisted of
$526.2 million in fixed rate mortgages and $88.6 million in variable rate
mortgage notes, and $394.3 million borrowed under its Credit Facility. All
financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the
net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net
financial position. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the
fixed and variable rate portions of the Company's debt portfolio. A change in
interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net
financial instrument position, but has no impact on interest incurred or cash
flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio
impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the net
financial instrument position.

The Company has entered into interest rate swap and rate cap agreements designed
to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on its variable rate debt. At
December 31, 2001, the Company had three interest rate swap agreements for
notional principal amounts aggregating $175 million. The swap agreements
effectively fix the interest rate on $100 million of Credit Facility borrowings
at 6.383%, $50 million at 6.080% and $25 million at 5.215% until September 2002.
In October 2001, the Company entered into three additional interest rate swap
agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on $100 million of Credit
Facility borrowings at 4.230% and on $75 million at 4.215% from September 2002
to June 2004. The interest rate cap agreements effectively fix the interest rate
on two variable rate mortgages. One rate cap fixes the interest rate on a
mortgage with a notional value of $75 million at 6.25% until maturity in April
2002. The second interest rate cap fixes the interest rate on a mortgage with a
notional value of $28 million at 8.7% until July 2004. The impact of the cap
agreements is recorded as a component of interest expense.


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

The sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the Company's debt
portfolio assumes an instantaneous 1% move in interest rates from their actual
levels at December 31, 2001 with all other variables held constant. As of
December 31, 2001, a 1% increase in actual interest rates would result in a
decrease in beneficiaries' equity of $27.3 million and a 1% decrease in actual
interest rates would result in an increase in beneficiaries' equity of $30.3
million.

Based on the Company's variable rate debt as of December 31, 2001, a 1% increase
in interest rates would result in an additional $2.1 million in interest expense
per year and a 1% decrease would reduce interest expense by $2.1 million per
year.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders of Brandywine Realty Trust:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Brandywine Realty Trust (a
Maryland real estate investment trust) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, beneficiaries'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2001. These financial statements and the schedules referred to below are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Brandywine Realty Trust and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The schedules listed in the
index to financial statements and schedules in Item 14 are presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
are not a required part of the basic financial statements. These schedules have
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
financial statements and in our opinion, fairly state in all material respects
the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

                             BRANDYWINE REALTY TRUST
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                DECEMBER 31, 2001



 1.  ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
     -------------------------------------

Brandywine Realty Trust, a Maryland Real Estate Investment Trust (collectively
with its subsidiaries, the "Company"), is a self-administered and self-managed
real estate investment trust (a "REIT") active in acquiring, developing,
redeveloping, leasing and managing office and industrial properties. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company's portfolio included 223 office properties, 46
industrial facilities and one mixed-use property (collectively, the
"Properties") that contained an aggregate of 17.3 million net rentable square
feet. The Properties are located in the office and industrial markets
surrounding Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; New Jersey and Long Island, New York;
and Richmond, Virginia. As of December 31, 2001, the Company also held economic
interests in thirteen real estate ventures (the "Real Estate Ventures") formed
with third parties to develop commercial properties.

The Company's interest in its assets is held through Brandywine Operating
Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership").
The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of
December 31, 2001, was entitled to approximately 94.3% of the Operating
Partnership's distributions after distributions to holders of Series B Preferred
Units (as defined in Note 3 below). The Operating Partnership owns a 95%
interest in Brandywine Realty Services Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation
(the "Management Company"), a taxable REIT subsidiary that, as of December 31,
2001, was performing management and leasing services for properties containing
an aggregate of approximately 20.6 million net rentable square feet, of which
17.3 million net rentable square feet related to properties owned by the Company
and approximately 3.3 million net rentable square feet related to properties
owned by unaffiliated third parties. The remaining 5% of the Management Company
is owned by a partnership comprised of two executives of the Company.

 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
     ------------------------------------------

Principles of Consolidation
---------------------------
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
the Operating Partnership. The portion of the Operating Partnership not owned by
the Company is presented as minority interest. Intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts reported in prior years have
been reclassified for comparative purposes.

Management Company
------------------
The Management Company, a taxable REIT subsidiary, provides management, leasing,
construction, development, redevelopment and other real estate related services
for the Company's properties and for third parties. Prior to December 31, 2000,
the Company owned 100% of the Management Company's non-voting preferred stock,
5% of its voting stock and accounted for its investment using the equity method.
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company converted its non-voting interest in the
Management Company to a voting interest. As a result, the Company owns 95% of
the Management Company's equity, has voting control and, therefore, consolidated
the Management Company in 2001.

Use of Estimates
----------------
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Real Estate Investments
-----------------------
Real estate investments are carried at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method based on the following useful lives: buildings and
improvements (5 to 40 years) and tenant improvements over the shorter of the
lease term or the life of the asset. Direct construction costs totaling $2.7
million in 2001, $1.8 million in 2000 and $882,000 in 1999 and interest totaling
$5.2 million in 2001, $8.2 million in 2000 and $2.1 million in 1999 were
capitalized related to the development of certain Properties and land holdings.
The Company expenses routine repair and maintenance expenditures.

                                     F - 6
<PAGE>

Real estate investments will be reviewed for impairment if facts and
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be
recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss will be based on the fair value
of the asset; generally, determined using valuation techniques, such as the
present value of expected future cash flows. No impairment adjustments have been
made as a result of this review process during 2001, 2000 and 1999.

Cash Equivalents
----------------
Cash equivalents are highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less. The Company maintains cash equivalents in financial institutions
in excess of insured limits.

Accounts Receivable
-------------------
The Company provides and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that
includes a provision for specifically identified accounts, as well as a
percentage of the unpaid receivable balance. Accounts receivable and accrued
rent receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $2.5
million and $2.0 million in 2001 and $1.3 million and $1.1 million in 2000. As
of December 31, 2001 and 2000, no tenant represents more than 10% of accounts
receivable.

Other Assets
------------
As of December 31, 2001, other assets included a direct financing lease of $16.0
million, prepaid real estate taxes of $5.5 million, deposits on properties to be
purchased in 2002 totaling $4.0 million, furniture, fixtures and equipment of
$2.7 million and $3.6 million of other assets. As of December 31, 2000, other
assets included deposits on properties to be purchased of $23.2 million, prepaid
real estate taxes of $4.5 million, furniture, fixtures and equipment of $.8
million and $4.3 million of other assets.

Marketable Securities
---------------------
The Company accounts for its investments in equity securities according to the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS 115"),
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, which requires
securities classified as "available-for-sale" to be stated at fair value.
Adjustments to fair value of available-for-sale securities are recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income in beneficiaries' equity.

Deferred Costs
--------------
Direct costs related to the financing and leasing of the Properties are
capitalized. Internal direct leasing costs deferred totaled $3.1 million in 2001
and $2.5 million in 2000. Capitalized financing fees are amortized over the
related loan term and capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the related
lease term. Accumulated amortization related to these costs was $11.8 million in
2001 and $13.1 million in 2000.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
-----------------------------------
Carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable,
other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and borrowings under the
Credit Facility approximate fair value due to the nature of these instruments.
Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the fair value disclosures.

Revenue Recognition
-------------------
Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term
regardless of when payments are due. The straight-line rent adjustment increased
revenue by approximately $6.2 million in 2001, $6.4 million in 2000 and $8.1
million in 1999. Certain lease agreements contain provisions that require
tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and certain common
area maintenance costs.

No tenant represented 10% or more of the Company's rental revenue in 2001, 2000
or 1999.

Income Taxes
------------
The Company elects to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections
856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code. In management's opinion, the requirements
to maintain this election are being met. Accordingly, no provision for Federal
income taxes has been reflected in the financial statements.


                                      F - 7
<PAGE>


Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of distributions to
shareholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes
due to differences in cost basis, the estimated useful lives used to compute
depreciation, and the allocation of net income and loss for financial versus tax
reporting purposes.

The Company is subject to a 4% Federal excise tax, if sufficient taxable income
is not distributed within prescribed time limits. The excise tax equals 4% of
the annual amount, if any, by which the sum of (a) 85% of the Company's ordinary
income and (b) 95% of the Company's net capital gain exceeds cash distributions
and certain taxes paid by the Company. No excise tax was incurred in 2001, 2000,
or 1999.

The Management Company is subject to Federal and state income taxes. The
operating results of the Management Company include a provision for income taxes
of $115,000 in 2000 and $57,000 in 1999. There was no provision required for
income taxes in 2001.

Earnings Per Share
------------------
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income applicable to Common
Shares by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of common share equivalents
outstanding during the period.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans
------------------------------
The Company follows Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, in accounting for stock-based compensation plans and
discloses the fair value of options granted and pro forma earnings as permitted
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.

Comprehensive Income
--------------------
Comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2001 includes unrealized
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and the effective portions of
changes in the fair value of derivatives. Net income as reported by the Company
reflects total comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2000 and
1999.

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
------------------------------------------------------------
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and its corresponding amendments
under SFAS No. 138. SFAS 133 requires the Company to measure every derivative
instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts) at fair value and record them in the balance sheet as either an asset
or liability. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, the changes in
fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in
earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portions
of changes in the fair value of the derivative are reported in other
comprehensive income. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments and
ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period.
For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2001, the Company was not party
to any derivative contract designated as a fair value hedge.

Upon adoption of this new standard as of January 1, 2001, the Company recorded a
charge of $1.3 million to comprehensive income for the cumulative effect of an
accounting change to recognize at fair value all derivatives that are designed
as cash flow hedging instruments. The Company recorded additional charges of
$3.4 million in other comprehensive income to recognize the change in value
during 2001. Over time, the unrealized gains/losses and the transition
adjustment held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified
into earnings as the underlying hedged items affect earnings, such as when the
forecasted interest payments occurs. It is expected that $5.0 million of net
losses will be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months.

                                     F - 8
<PAGE>


The Company formally assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an on-going
basis, whether each derivative is highly-effective in offsetting changes in fair
values of cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative
is not highly-effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a
highly-effective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting
prospectively.

The Company manages its ratio of fixed-to-floating rate debt with the objective
of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate. To manage this mix
in a cost-effective manner, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest
rate swap agreements, in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of
fixed and/or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts. As
of December 31, 2001, the maximum length of time which the Company is hedging
its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions
is through June 2004. There was no gain or loss reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income into earnings during 2001 as a result of the
discontinuance of a cash flow hedge due to the probability of the original
forecasted transaction not occurring.


New Pronouncements
------------------

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations (effective July 1, 2001), SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets (effective for the Company on January 1, 2002) and SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001). SFAS No. 141 prohibits
pooling-of-interests accounting for acquisitions. SFAS No. 142 specifies that
goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be amortized, but instead be
subject to periodic impairment testing. Neither of these statements will have a
material impact on the Company's financial statements. SFAS No. 144 establishes
a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets,
including discontinued operations. While SFAS No. 144 will not impact net
income, it will impact how operations related to properties that have been sold
or properties that are intended to be sold are classified in the Company's
balance sheet and statement of operations. The results of operations for such
properties are to be presented as discontined in the statement of operations for
all periods presented and properties intended to be sold are to be designated as
"held for Sale" on the balance sheet.


 3.  MINORITY INTEREST
     -----------------

Income allocated to the Minority Interest is based on the percentage ownership
of the Operating Partnership held by third parties throughout the year. Minority
interest is comprised of Class A Units of limited partnership interest ("Class A
Units") and Series B Preferred Units of limited partnership interest ("Series B
Preferred Units"). The Operating Partnership issued these interests to persons
that contributed assets to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership
is obligated to redeem, at the request of a holder, each Class A Unit for cash
or one Common Share, at the option of the Company. Each Series B Preferred Unit
has a stated value of $50.00 and is convertible, at the option of the holder,
into Class A Units at a conversion price of $28.00. The conversion price
declines to $26.50, if the average trading price of the Common Shares during the
60-day period ending December 31, 2003 is $23.00 or less. The Series B Preferred
Units bear a preferred distribution of 7.25% per annum, subject to an increase
in the event quarterly distributions paid to holders of Common Shares exceed
$0.51 per share. The Company declared distributions of $7.1 million in 2001 and
2000 and $6.1 million in 1999 to the holders of Series B Preferred Units and
$3.7 million in 2001, $3.5 million in 2000 and $3.4 million in 1999 to holders
of Class A Units. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, there were
2,151,658 and 2,156,150 Class A Units and 1,950,000 Series B Preferred Units
held by third party investors.

 4.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS

In addition to the sales and acquisitions above, the Company consumated an
exchange of properties with Prentiss Properties Acquisition Partners, L.P.

acres of developable land for total consideration of $215.2 million. The Company
conveyed to Prentiss four office properties located in Northern Virginia that
contain an aggregate of 657,000 net rentable square feet, assumed $79.7 million
of mortgage debt secured by certain of the Prentiss properties, issued a $7.8
million promissory note, paid $15.9 million at closing and agreed to make
additional payments totaling $7.0 million (including $5.4 million of payments
discounted at 7.5%) over a three year period subsequent to closing. The Company
also contributed to Prentiss its interest in a real estate venture that owns two
additional office properties that contain an aggregate of 452,000 net rentable
square feet and received a combination of preferred and common units of limited
partnership interest in Prentiss having a value of $10.7 million, as of the

 5.  MANAGEMENT COMPANY
     ------------------

Prior to December 31, 2000, the Company owned 100% of the Management Company's
non-voting preferred stock, 5% of its voting stock and accounted for its
investment using the equity method. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company
converted its non-voting interest in the Management Company to a voting
interest. As a result, the Company owns 95% of the Management Company's equity,
has voting control and, therefore, consolidated the Management Company in 2001.

                                     F - 10

$11.9 million in 2000 and $11.3 million in 1999. The Management Company also
receives reimbursement of certain costs attributable to the operations of the
Properties. These costs, included in property operating expenses, amounted to
$9.2 million in 2000 and $7.3 million in 1999. Summarized unaudited financial
information for the Management Company as of and for the years ended December
31, 2000 and 1999 is as follows:

 6.  INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED REAL ESTATE VENTURES
     -------------------------------------------------

As of December 31, 2001, the Company had invested approximately $19.1 million in
thirteen Real Estate Ventures (net of returns of investment received by the
Company). The Company, through subsidiaries, formed these ventures with
unaffiliated third parties to develop office properties or to acquire land in
anticipation of possible development of office properties. Nine of the Real
Estate Ventures own nine office buildings that contain an aggregate of
approximately 1.0 million net rentable square feet; one Real Estate Venture is
developing one office buildings that will contain, upon completion, an aggregate
of approximately 345,000 net rentable square feet; one Real Estate Venture is
developing a hotel property that will contain, upon completion, approximately
137 rooms; and two Real Estate Ventures hold approximately nine acres of land
for future development.

The Company accounts for its non-controlling interests in Real Estate Ventures
using the equity method. Non-controlling ownership interests generally range
from 6% to 65%, subject to specified priority allocations in certain real estate
ventures. These investments, initially recorded at cost, are subsequently
adjusted for the Company's net equity in the ventures' income or loss and cash
contributions and distributions. The following is a summary of the financial
position of the unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company had
investment interests as of December 31, 2001 and 2000:

                                           ==========

As of December 31, 2001, the Company had guaranteed repayment of approximately
$2.6 million of loans for the Real Estate Venture debt. The Company selectively
provides completion guaranties on behalf of Real Estate Ventures as part of
their development activities. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had provided
a completion guaranty relating to the construction of one development project
which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2002.

 7.  INDEBTEDNESS
     ------------

The Company utilizes credit facility borrowings for general business purposes,
including the acquisition of properties and the repayment of debt. In June 2001,
the Company amended its unsecured credit facility (the "Credit Facility") to
increase its borrowing capacity from $450 million to $500 million and to extend
the maturity to June 2004. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR (LIBOR
was 1.88% at December 31, 2001) plus 1.5%, with the spread over LIBOR subject to
reductions from .10% to .25% or increases of .25% based on the Company's
leverage. The Credit Facility matures in June 2004, subject to the Company's
right upon payment of a fee to extend the maturity to June 2005. As of December
31, 2001, the Company had $394.3 million of borrowings and $13.4 million of
letters-of-credit outstanding and $92.3 million of unused availability under the
Credit Facility. The weighted-average interest rate on the Company's unsecured
credit facilities was 6.48% in 2001, 7.84% in 2000, and 6.95% in 1999.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $614.8 million of mortgage notes
payable secured by 106 of the Properties and certain land holdings. Fixed rate
mortgages, totaling $526.2 million, require payments of principal and/or
interest (or imputed interest) at rates ranging from 6.80% to 9.25% and mature
or matured at various dates from July 2003 through July 2027. Variable rate
mortgages, totaling $88.6 million, require payments of principal and/or interest
at rates ranging from LIBOR plus .76% to 1.75% or 75% of prime (the prime rate
was 4.75% at December 31, 2001) and mature at various dates from February 2003
through July 2027. The weighted-average interest rate on the Company's mortgages
was 7.39% in 2001, 7.92% in 2000, and 7.10% in 1999.

The Company has entered into interest rate swap and rate cap agreements designed
to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on certain variable rate debt. At
December 31, 2001, the Company had three interest rate swap agreements for
notional principal amounts aggregating $175 million. The swap agreements
effectively fix the interest rate on $100 million of Credit Facility borrowings
at 6.383%, $50 million at 6.080% and $25 million at 5.215% until September 2002.
In October 2001, the Company entered into three additional interest rate swap
agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on $100 million of Credit
Facility borrowings at 4.230% and on $75 million at 4.215% from September 2002
to June 2004. The interest rate cap agreements effectively fix the interest rate
on two variable rate mortgages. One rate cap fixes the interest rate on a
mortgage with a notional value of $75 million at 6.25% until maturity in April
2002. The second interest rate cap fixes the interest rate on a mortgage with a
notional value of $28 million at 8.7% until July 2004. The impact of these
agreements is recorded as a component of interest expense. As of December 31,
2001, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements, based on quotes from
an independent third party, was $4.6 million, which represents the estimated
amount that the Company would pay if the contracts were terminated.

Aggregate principal payments on mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2001 are
due as follows (in thousands):

                  2002                    $    8,874

The Credit Facility requires the maintenance as of certain ratios related to
minimum net worth, debt-to-total capitalization and fixed charge coverage and
various non-financial covenants. As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in
compliance with all debt covenants. The Company paid interest totaling $74.2
million in 2001, $67.7 million in 2000, and $67.3 million in 1999. As of
December 31, 2001, the carrying value of the Company's debt was below fair
market value by approximately $93.4 million, as determined by using year-end
interest rates and market conditions. During 2001, the Company wrote-off $1.1
million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of
the Credit Facility and a mortgage note payable which were accounted for as
extraordinary items.

8.  PREFERRED SHARES AND BENEFICIARIES' EQUITY
    ------------------------------------------

In 1998, the Company issued $37.5 million of convertible preferred securities
with a 7.25% coupon rate (the Series A Preferred Shares). The Series A Preferred
Shares, with a stated value of $50.00, are convertible into Common Shares, at
the option of the holder, at a conversion price of $28.00. The conversion price
declines to $26.50, if the trading price of the Common Shares during the 60-day
period ending December 31, 2003 is $23.00 or less. The Series A Preferred Shares
distribution is subject to an increase, if quarterly distributions paid to
Common Share holders exceeds $0.51 per share. The Series A Preferred Shares are
perpetual and may be redeemed, at the Company's option, at par beginning in
January 2004 or earlier, if the market price of the Common Shares exceeds
specified levels.

In 1999, the Company issued $105.0 million of convertible preferred securities
(the Series B Preferred Shares) with an 8.75% coupon rate for net proceeds of
$94.8 million. The Company is accreting the discount as a charge to cumulative
earnings through the redemption date in 2007. The Series B Preferred Shares,
convertible into Common Shares at a conversion price of $24.00 per share, are
entitled to quarterly dividends equal to the greater of $0.525 per share or the
quarterly dividend on the number of Common Shares into which a Series B
Preferred Share is convertible. The Series B Preferred Shares are perpetual and
may be redeemed, at the Company's option, at par, beginning in April 2007. In
addition, the Company may require the conversion of the Series B Preferred
Shares into Common Shares starting in April 2004, if certain conditions are met,
including that the Common Shares are then trading in excess of 130% of the
conversion price. Upon certain changes in control of the Company, the holder may
require the Company to redeem its Series B Preferred Shares. However, the
Company has the ability and intent to cause the Series B Preferred Shares to be
converted into Common Shares rather than redeemed in such circumstances. In
addition, as part of the transaction, the Company issued the holder seven-year
warrants exercisable for 500,000 Common Shares at an exercise price of $24.00
per share.

The Company's Board of Trustees approved a share repurchase program authorizing
the Company to repurchase its outstanding Common Shares. During the third
quarter of 2001, the Board of Trustees increased the number of shares authorized
to be repurchased from three million shares to four million shares. Through
December 31, 2001, the Company has repurchased 2.7 million of its Common Shares
at an average price of $16.83 per share. The Company repurchased 302,437 Common
Shares for $5.9 million (average price of $19.54 per share) in 2001; 957,729
Common Shares for $15.3 million (average price of $15.95 per share) in 2000 and
1,344,295 Common Shares for $22.2 million in 1999 (average price of $16.69 per
share). Under the share repurchase program, the Company has authority to
repurchase an additional 1.3 million shares. No time limit has been placed on
the duration of the share repurchase program.

At December 31, 2001, 450,747 restricted Common Shares were held by certain
employees of the Company. The restricted shares, valued at $15.6 million at
issuance, are amortized over their respective vesting periods of four to eight
years. The Company recorded compensation expense of $2.8 million in 2001, $2.0
million in 2000 and $1.8 million in 1999 related to these shares.

9.  SHARE PURCHASE OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
    -----------------------------------

The Company maintains a plan that authorizes the issuance of incentive stock
options and non-qualified stock options to key employees to purchase five
million Common Shares of the Company. The terms and conditions of option awards
are determined by the Board of Trustees. Incentive stock options may not be
granted at exercise prices less than fair value of the stock at the time of
grant. Options granted by the Company generally vest over two to five years. All
options awarded by the Company to date are non-qualified stock options. Options
were granted at exercise prices ranging from 125% to 165% of fair market value
on the grant date in 1999 and 100% to 115% of fair market value on the grant
date in 1998. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has 1.7 million shares
available for future issuance under the plan.

Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the estimated weighted-average
fair value of stock options granted was $1.21 in 1999. Assumptions made in
determining estimates of fair value include: risk-free interest rates of 5.6% in
1999, a volatility factor of .280 in 1999, a dividend yield of 8.9% in 1999, and
a weighted-average life expectancy of 10 years in 1999.

13. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
    --------------------------

In 1998, the Board authorized the Company to make loans totaling up to $5.0
million to enable employees of the Company to purchase Common Shares at fair
market value. The loans have five-year terms, are full recourse, and are secured
by the Common Shares purchased. Interest, payable quarterly, accrues on the
loans at the lower of the interest rate borne on borrowings under the Company's
Credit Facility or a rate based on the dividend payments on the Common Shares.
As of December 31, 2001, the interest rate was 3.40% per annum. The loans are
payable at the earlier of the stated maturity date or 90 days following the
employee's termination. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had funded loans of
$4.7 million to employees secured by an aggregate of 260,494 Common Shares.

The Company owns 384,615 shares of US Realtel, Inc. ("USR") Common Stock and
holds warrants exercisable for 600,000 additional shares. The warrants have an
exercise price of $8.00 per share and expire on December 31, 2004. In December
2001, the Company wrote-off its investment of $2.5 million in USR as the loss in
value was deemed to be other than temporary. An officer of the Company holds a
position on USR's Board of Directors.

In February 2000, the Company loaned an aggregate of $2.5 million to two
executive officers to enable them to purchase Common Shares of the Company. One
loan has a four-year term and bears interest at the lower of the Company's cost
of funds or a rate based on the dividend payable on the Common Shares, but not
to exceed 10% annum. This loan is subject to forgiveness over a three-year
period, with the amount of forgiveness tied to the Company's total shareholder
return compared to the total shareholder return of peer group companies. This
loan is also subject to forgiveness in the event of a change of control of the
Company. The executive may repay the loan at maturity by surrendering Common
Shares valued at the executive's initial per share purchase price of $15.625.
This loan is reflected as a reduction in beneficiaries equity. The other loan
was restructured, effective December 31, 2001, in connection with the
executive's transition to a non-executive, non-managerial status to provide for
its forgiveness in equal installments in April 2002 and April 2003. Principal
and interest totaling $.9 million was forgiven related to these loans in 2001.

14. OPERATING LEASES
    ----------------

The Company leases properties to tenants under operating leases with various
expiration dates extending to 2020. As of December 31, 2001, leases covering
approximately 2.6 million square feet or 16.3% of the net rentable square
footage were scheduled to expire during 2002. Minimum future rentals on
noncancelable leases at December 31, 2001 are as follows (in thousands):

                 Year                         Minimum Rent

                 2004                            182,774
                 2005                            140,128

                 2007 and thereafter             335,217
                                              ----------
                                              $1,229,633
                                              ==========

Total minimum future rentals presented above do not include amounts to be
received as tenant reimbursements for increases in certain operating costs.

15. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
    ---------------------

The Company sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan for its employees. Each
employee may contribute up to 18% of annual compensation. At its discretion, the
Company can make matching contributions equal to a percentage of the employee's
elective contribution and profit sharing contributions. Employees vest in
employer contributions over a five year service period. The Company
contributions were $669,000 in 2001, $690,000 in 2000 and $331,000 in 1999.

</TABLE>


(A)  During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $6.6 million
     non-recurring charge related to the conversion of the Company's Chairman to
     a non-executive, non-managerial status and the write-down of the Company's
     $2.5 million investment in a telecommunications company that was deemed to
     be other than temporary. The $4.1 million charge related to the Company's
     Chairman reflects an accrual on account of payment obligations of the
     Company under its employment agreement with the Chairman, accelerated
     vesting of his restricted shares and restructuring of his executive stock
     loan.

(B)  The Company wrote-off $1.1 million of unamortized deferred financing costs
     related to the refinancing of the Credit Facility and a mortgage note
     payable which were accounted for as extraordinary items during the 2nd
     quarter of 2001.

(C)  The Company recorded gains on sales of properties of $9.5 million during
     the 3rd quarter of 2000.

The summation of quarterly earnings per share amounts do not necessarily equal
year to date amounts.

17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
    -----------------------------

Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from time to time in litigation on various matters,
including disputes with tenants and disputes arising out of agreements to
purchase or sell properties. Given the nature of the Company's business
activities, these lawsuits are considered routine to the conduct of its
business. The result of any particular lawsuit cannot be predicted, because of
the very nature of litigation, the litigation process and its adversarial
nature, and the jury system.

The Company is a defendant in a case in which the plaintiffs allege that the
Company breached its obligation to purchase a portfolio of properties for
approximately $83.0 million. In July 1999, the Superior Court of New Jersey,
Camden County, dismissed the complaint against the Company with prejudice. The
plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration, which motion the
Superior Court denied. Plaintiffs then appealed to the Appellate Division, which
is the intermediate appellate level court in New Jersey. In December 2000, the
Appellate Division affirmed in part and reversed in part the Chancery Division's
earlier dismissal of the entire action. The Appellate Division affirmed the
dismissal of the fraud and other non-contractual counts in the Complaint, but
reversed the contract and reformation counts and remanded these to the lower
court for further proceedings. The Company sought review of this decision by the
Supreme Court of New Jersey, but in March 2001, that Court declined to consider
the appeal. The case has therefore returned to the Chancery Division, where it
is now in the written discovery stage. In management's opinion, this proceeding
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

                                     F - 19
<PAGE>

In November 1999, a third-party complaint was filed in the Superior Court of New
Jersey, Burlington County, by BRI OP Limited Partnership ("BRI OP") against the
Company and several other persons and entities, including several former
affiliates of the Company, relative to Greentree Shopping Center located in
Marlton, New Jersey ("Subject Property"). The Subject Property was owned and
managed by a subsidiary of the Company between 1986 and 1988. BRI OP, also a
former owner of the Subject Property, has been sued by the present owner and
manager ("Owner") of the Subject Property, seeking indemnification and
contribution for costs related to the remediation of environmental contamination
allegedly caused by a dry cleaning business, which was a tenant of the Subject
Property. BRI OP, in turn, brought a third-party action against the Company and
others seeking indemnification for environmental remediation and clean up costs
for which it may be held liable. During the course of the proceeding, the Owner
petitioned the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP") to
issue a directive to clean up the Subject Property to certain parties, including
the Company, BRI OP and the dry cleaner, who were allegedly responsible for the
environmental contamination under the New Jersey Spill Compensation and Control
Act ("Spill Act"). NJDEP issued such a directive to those parties and the Owner
in May 2001 (the "Directive") which requires the all of the parties to the
Directive to remediate the Subject Property. Failure to comply with a Spill Act
directive would subject a noncomplying party to treble damages (i.e., triple the
cost of the cleanup if performed by NJDEP or others ) and, potentially,
penalties under the Spill Act.

Following issuance of the Directive, the parties to whom the Directive was
issued commenced settlement negotiations. The negotiations resulted in an
agreement in principle between the Company, BRI OP and the Owner, which the
parties are in the process of reducing to writing. Under the settlement, the
Owner would perform and obtain NJDEP approval of the cleanup and release and
indemnify (with limited exceptions) the Company and BRI OP from and against
liability for matters relating to the contamination. The Company believes that
the agreement reached with the Owner, upon finalization and implementation, will
also satisfy its obligation to participate in the remediation pursuant to the
Directive; however, the Company has not yet confirmed this with the NJDEP
(although it intends to do so upon finalization of the settlement). The Company
believes that, regardless of whether the Superior Court action is settled or the
Company is relieved of further responsibility under the Directive, based on its
assessment of the estimated cost of any required remediation, the availability
of other parties that are potentially responsible for all or a portion of such
cost, and defenses that may be available to the Company, that this matter will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or
results of operations.

Letters-of-Credit and Other Commitments
In connection with certain mortgages, the Company is required to maintain
leasing and capital reserve accounts with the mortgage lenders through
letters-of-credit which totaled $13.4 million at December 31, 2001. The Company
is also required to maintain escrow accounts for taxes, insurance and tenant
security deposits that amounted to $16.3 million at December 31, 2001. The
related tenant rents are deposited into the loan servicer's depository accounts,
which are used to fund debt service, operating expenses, capital expenditures
and the escrow and reserve accounts, as necessary. Any excess cash is included
in cash and cash equivalents.

The Company also provides customary environmental indemnities in connection with
construction and permanent financings on behalf of Real Estate Ventures.

As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned 443 acres of land for future
development and held options to purchase 61 additional acres.


18. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

During 2002, the Company sold 17 properties, containing 803,000 net rentable
square feet, for $41.7 million realizing a gain of $4.0 million. In addition,
the Company purchased four properties, containing 360,000 net rentable square
feet, for $67.2 million.
