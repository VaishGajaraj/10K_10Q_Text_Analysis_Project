registrant&#146;s most recently completed second fiscal quarter), the aggregate
market value of the shares of the Registrant&#146;s common stock held by
non-affiliates (based upon the closing price of such shares as quoted on the
Electronic Bulletin Board maintained by the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc.) was approximately $6.17 million. Shares of the Registrant&#146;s
common stock held by each executive officer and director and each by each person

for other purposes. There were a total of 21,434,942 shares of the registrant&#146;s

<P align=justify>This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the following
&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,&#148; contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements include, among others, those
concerning our expected financial performance and strategic and operational
plans, as well as all assumptions, expectations, predictions, intentions or
beliefs about future events. You are cautioned that any such forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and that a number of risks
and uncertainties could cause actual results of the Company to differ materially
from those anticipated, expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
The words &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;targets,&#148; &#147;optimistic,&#148;
&#147;intend,&#148; &#147;aim,&#148; &#147;will&#148; or similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical
fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. Risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
anticipated include risks related to, among others: our potential inability to
raise additional capital that is necessary to fund our operations and our
expansion, including our intended acquisitions; the possibility that third
parties hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing our products;
the emergence of additional competing technologies; changes in domestic and
foreign laws, regulations and taxes; changes in economic conditions;
uncertainties related to China&#146;s legal system and economic, political and social
events in China; a general economic downturn; a downturn in the securities
markets; Securities and Exchange Commission regulations which affect trading in
the securities of &#147;penny stocks.&#148; Additional disclosures regarding factors that
could cause our results and performance to differ from results or performance
anticipated by this Report are discussed in Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; </P>
<P align=justify>Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various
disclosures made by us in this Report and our other filings with the SEC. These
reports attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and
prospects. The forward-looking statements made in this Report speak only as of
the date hereof and we disclaim any obligation to provide updates, revisions or
amendments to any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in our
expectations or future events. </P>

<P align=justify style="margin-left: 10%; margin-top: -25.5pt"><B>BUSINESS. </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Overview of Our Business</B> </P>
<P align=justify>We are a biopharmaceutical company and through our indirect
majority-owned Chinese subsidiary, Shandong Taibang, we are principally engaged
in the research, development, production and manufacturing of plasma-based
pharmaceutical products in China. Shandong Taibang operates from our
manufacturing facility located in Taian City, Shandong Province. The
plasma-based biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China is highly
restricted by both the provincial and central governments. <B></B>Accordingly,
the manufacturing process of our products is strictly monitored from the initial
collection of plasma from human donors to finished products. Our principal
products include our approved human albumin and immunoglobulin products. </P>
<P align=justify>We are approved to sell human albumin 20%/10ml, 20%/25ml and
20%/50ml. Human albumin is our top-selling product. Sales of these human albumin
products represented approximately 57.8% and 63.5% of our total revenues,
respectively, for the each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Human
albumin is principally used to increase blood volume while immunoglobulin is
used for certain disease preventions and cures. Shandong Taibang&#146;s approved
human albumin and immunoglobulin products use human plasma as the basic raw
material. Albumin has been used for almost 50 years to treat critically ill
patients by replacing lost fluid and maintaining adequate blood volume and
pressure. All of our products are prescription medicines administered in the
form of injections. </P>
<P align=justify>We sell our products to customers in the PRC. Our sales have
historically been made on the basis of short-term arrangements and our largest
customers have changed over the years. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2007, our top 5 customers accounted for approximately 16.2% and 14.9%,
respectively, of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2007, our largest customer accounted for approximately 6.4% and 5.3%, of our
revenue, respectively. As we continue to diversify our geographic presence,
customer base and product mix, we expect that our largest customers will
continue to change from year to year. </P>
<P align=justify>We have product liability insurance covering all of our
products. However, since our establishment in 2002, there has not been any
product liability claims nor has any legal action been filed against the Company
brought by patients related to the use of our products. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Our Corporate History and Structure</B> </P>
<P align=justify>China Biologic Products, Inc. was originally incorporated on
December 20, 1989 under the laws of the State of Texas as Shepherd Food
Equipment, Inc. On November 20, 2000, Shepherd Food Equipment, Inc. changed its
corporate name to Shepherd Food Equipment, Inc. Acquisition Corp., or Shepherd.
Shepherd is the survivor of a May 28, 2003, merger between Shepherd and GRC
Holdings, Inc. or GRC. In the merger, the company adopted the Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws of GRC and changed its corporate name to GRC Holdings,
Inc. On January 10, 2007, a Plan of Conversion became effective pursuant to
which GRC was converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to
China Biologic Products, Inc. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our Acquisition of Logic Express</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>On July 19, 2006, we completed a reverse acquisition with Logic
Express, whereby we issued to the shareholders of Logic Express 18,484,715
shares of our common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of Logic Express and its majority-owned Chinese
operating subsidiary, Shandong Taibang. As a result of the reverse acquisition,
Logic Express became our 100% owned subsidiary and the former shareholders of
Logic Express became our controlling stockholders with 96.1% of our common
stock. Shandong Taibang became our 82.76% -owned indirect subsidiary and is the
operating company for all of our commercial operations. Shandong Taibang is a
sino-foreign joint venture company established on October 23, 2002 with a
registered capital of RMB80 million (then approximately $10.3 million). </P>

<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_6></A>
<P align=justify>The reverse acquisition is considered to be a recapitalization
(issuance of stock by Logic Express for our net monetary assets) in substance,
rather than a business combination. Logic Express is treated as the continuing
reporting entity that acquired the Company. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Acquisition of Plasma Stations</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>In December 2006, our subsidiary, Shandong Taibang, entered
into asset transfer agreements with the Shandong Provincial government to
acquire all the assets of five plasma stations in Shandong Province for
approximately $2,607,356. The value of the assets was determined by qualified
valuation experts registered in the PRC. We obtained the permit to operate the
stations in January 2007. In January 2007, Shandong Taibang entered into letters
of intent to acquire certain assets of two plasma stations in Guangxi Province,
for approximately $761,781. They obtained their operating permits in February
and April 2007, respectively. The consideration paid for these acquisitions was
determined based on independent valuations performed by qualified valuation
experts based in the PRC. </P>
<P align=justify>We acquired the assets of these plasma stations through
separate Shandong Taibang subsidiaries, specially formed for this purpose. The
subsidiaries holding six of our new plasma stations are the Xia Jin Plasma
Company, the Qi He Plasma Company, the He Ze Plasma Company, the Huan Jiang
Plasma Company, the Yang Gu Plasma Company, and the Zhang Qiu Plasma Company.
The seventh plasma station is held in the Fang Cheng Plasma Company, which is
80% owned by Shandong Taibang and 20% owned by Lin Feng, an unrelated third
party. </P>
<P align=justify>In January 2007, Shandong Taibang also signed a letter of
intent to acquire certain assets from a third plasma station in Guangxi
Province. However, there can be no assurance that the acquisition of these
assets can be completed or continue on the same terms that we have initially
agreed to in the letter of intent as the permit for this station is in dispute.
Please refer to &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; for more information regarding this dispute.
<B></B></P>
<P align=justify>In June 2008, we received approval from the Guangxi Province
Bureau of Health to set up a new plasma collection station in Pu Bei County,
Guangxi Province. The new plasma collection station will be located in the
Centralized Industry Zone of Pu Bei County and when it becomes operational, it
will replace CBP's existing Fang Cheng Plasma Collection Station, or Fang Cheng.
We decided to relocate Fang Cheng to a more strategic location to increase
collection volumes. <B></B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Establishment of Shandong Medical</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>In September 2006, Shandong Taibang applied to establish a
wholly owned subsidiary, Shandong Missile Medical Co., Ltd., or Shandong
Medical, with registered capital of $384,600, fully paid on March 1, 2007. On
February 7, 2007, Shandong Medical obtained a distribution license for
biological products, except for vaccine, from the Shandong Food and Drug
Administration, for a license period of 5 years from the date of obtaining the
license. The registration of Shandong Medical was ultimately approved by
Shandong Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on July
4, 2007 and Shandong Medical was formally registered on July 19, 2007. The scope
of business is wholesale of biological products, except vaccines, with a license
period of 25 years from the date of registration. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Proposed Acquisition of Equity Interest in
Dalin</I></B><B> </B></P>
<P align=justify>On September 26, 2008, we agreed to acquire a 90% controlling
interest in Chongqing Dalin Biologic Technologies Co., Ltd., or Dalin, for a
purchase price of RMB 194,400,000 (approximately $28.4 million). Dalin owns 54%
of the equity interest in Qianfeng Biological Products Co., Ltd., or Qianfeng,
one of the largest plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies in China, located in
Guiyang, Guizhou Province. The Company has completed the legal and financial due
diligence and expects the transaction to close within a few months, subject to
the formal transfer of title to the Company. In January 2009, Logic Express
appointed three out of the four Board of Directors members to the Chongqing
Dalin to take control of Dalin.&nbsp; On January 16, 2009, the shareholders of
Qianfeng Biological Products (&#147;Qianfeng&#148;), which Chongqing Dalin owns 54% equity
interest, elected four Board of Directors appointed by Chongqing Dalin as part
of its seven board members.&nbsp; On January 17, 2009, the Board of Directors of
Qianfeng elected a new management team consists of all Logic Express and
Chongqing Dalin&#146;s appointees, including CEO, Executive Senior Vice President,
CFO and Directors of sales.&nbsp; As a result, the Company took over the control
of Qianfeng starting January 16, 2009.</P>
<P align=justify>As part of its due diligence investigation into Dalin and
Qianfeng, the Company discovered that the indirect interest in Qianfeng that
would be acquired under Equity Transfer Agreement will be diluted. The local AIC
records show Dalin as a 54% shareholder of Qianfeng. However, Qianfeng issued
equity to certain investors pursuant to a capital increase agreement, dated May
2007. Qianfeng received the consideration for the equity, but the increase in
registered capital and issuance of the equity interest has not yet been
registered with AIC. A shareholder of Qianfeng brought a lawsuit claiming that
such shareholder&#146;s right of first refusal with respect to the new equity
issuance was violated. When the capital increase is registered with AIC, Dalin
will own about 43.3% in Qianfeng. The lawsuit brought by the Qianfeng
shareholder was decided against such shareholder, who subsequently appealed.
Therefore, Dalin&#146;s interests in Qianfeng could be diluted to as low as 41.3% as
the result of the issuance of additional equity to the shareholder, if his
appeal prevails. Even if the indirect equity interest that the Company acquires
through the proposed acquisition is diluted down to 41.3%, the Company would be
able to retain control over Qianfeng as a result of the four board membership to
the Qianfeng&#146;s board. The Company does not expect this dispute to impact its
ability to complete the acquisition.</P>

<P align=justify>Qianfeng is one of the largest plasma-based biopharmaceutical
companies in China and is the only manufacturer currently operating in Guizhou
Province. With a population of 39 million, Guizhou Province has historically
produced the highest volumes of plasma collection in China, because a higher
proportion of its population has been willing to engage in the collection
process. Guizhou Province has a total of 19 plasma collection stations in
operation, collecting approximately 1,200 tons of plasma supply every year.
Qianfeng owns 7 of these plasma collection stations, of which 6 are currently in
operation and collecting approximately 250 tons of plasma supply per year, with
an annual capacity of 40 tons. We intend to employ more advanced collection
techniques at these stations to improve yields and generate additional plasma
supply. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that Qianfeng currently controls approximately 9.5%
of the market for plasma-based biopharmaceutical products in China. Qianfeng is
in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, standards, and has been
approved by the PRC&#146;s State Food and Drug Administration or the SFDA to produce
six types of plasma-based products including Human Albumin, Human
Immunoglobulin, Human Intravenous Immunoglobulin, Human Hepatitis B
Immunoglobulin, Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin and Human Rabies Immune Globulin.

<P align=justify><B><I>Proposed Acquisition of Equity Interest in
Huitian</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>On October 10, 2008, our indirect majority owned subsidiary,
Shandong Taibang entered into an agreement to acquire 35% of the equity interest
in Xi&#146;an Huitian Blood Products Co., Ltd., or Huitian, a biopharmaceutical
company based in Xi&#146;an, Shaanxi Province, from Mr. Fan Qingchun, a PRC citizen,
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6,502,902 (RMB 44,327,890)
including interest of $48,102 (RMB 327,890). As of March 17, 2009, the Company
has completed the financial and legal due diligence investigations on Huitian
and the parties have successfully completed its registration with the
Administration of Industry and Commerce in Xi&#146;An, Shannxi Province to transfer
the 35% equity title from Mr. Fan Qingchun, the holder, to Shandong Taibang in
accordance with the equity transfer agreement.
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The final installment payment of
approximately $3,373,119 (RMB 22,993,315), which includes the accrued interest
of approximately $145,719 (RMB 993,315), was due March 31, 2009. While the
Company is able and willing to make the final payment, the local tax authority
where Huitian is located prohibited the Company from making the final payment
due to the dispute over the Mr. Fan&#146;s personal income tax rate and the
withholding tax receiving jurisdiction. The Company is awaiting the final
decision from the local tax authority and expects the payment can be made during
April, 2009. </P>
</font>
<P align=justify>Huitian is a manufacturer of plasma-based biopharmaceutical
products in Shaanxi Province and is one of only 32 such manufacturers in China
who are government approved. Shaanxi Province, which has a population of 37
million, has had a historically high collection volume with approximately ten
plasma collection stations in operation, collecting approximately 300 tons of
plasma supply each year. Only four of the collection stations in Shaanxi
Province are government approved and three of these are owned by Huitian.
Huitian produces about 80 tons of plasma-based products per year and has 200
tons of annual production capacity. Huitian believes that it currently controls
approximately 1.2% of the market for plasma-based biopharmaceutical products in
China, a factor which we believe provides strong long-term growth potential.
</P>
<P align=justify>Huitian is in compliance with GMP standards and it is also
approved by the SFDA for the production of Human Albumin, Human Immunoglobulin,
Human Immunoglobulin for Intravenous Injection, and Human Hepatitis B
Immunoglobulin products. </P>

<P align=justify><B>Our Industry </B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Human Albumin and Immunoglobulin Products</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Our principal products are our approved human albumin and
immunoglobulin products, with human plasma as the main ingredient. About 55% of
human blood is composed of a liquid known as plasma. The remaining 45% of human
blood is made of three major types of cells: red blood cells, white blood cells,
and platelets. </P>
<P align=justify>Plasma carries a large number of important proteins, including
albumin, gamma globulin, and clotting factors. Albumin is the main protein in
blood. It helps regulate the water content of tissues and blood. Gamma globulin
is composed of tens of thousands of unique antibody molecules. Antibodies
neutralize or help destroy infectious organisms. Each antibody is designed to
target one specific invading organism. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>The Plasma Product Industry in China</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Plasma-based biopharmaceutical products are manufactured from
healthy human plasma. The collection of plasma for the production of such
products is influenced by factors such as government regulations, geographical
locations of collection stations, sanitary conditions of collection stations,
living standards of the donors, and cultural and religious beliefs. The
collection of human plasma in China is regulated, and until recently, only
licensed Plasmapheresis stations owned and operated by the government could
collect human plasma. Each collection station was only allowed to supply plasma
to the one manufacturer that had signed the &#147;Quality Responsibility&#148; statement
with them. However, in March 2006, the Ministry of Health promulgated certain
&#147;Measures on Reforming Plasma Collection Stations,&#148; or the Blood Collection
Measures, whereby the ownership and management of PRC plasma stations are
required to be transferred to plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies while the
regulatory supervision and administrative control remain with the PRC
government. Plasma stations that did not complete their reform by December 31,
2006 risked revocation of their license to collect plasma. China currently has a
severe shortage of plasma because the reform of the industry has led to the
closure of many stations that did not meet the government&#146;s new industry
standards. </P>
<P align=justify>The supply of plasma has been on the decline since 2003 from
the historical high of annual supply of approximately 7,000 tons resulting from
the PRC government&#146;s mandate to reform the country&#146;s collection practices. We
estimate that the current annual supply of plasma in China amounts to
approximately 4,000 tons, as compared to 30,000 tons in the global market, with
the six largest manufacturers of plasma products accounting for approximately
50% of the annual plasma collection. Recent regulatory changes have improved the
quality of blood and plasma by increasing cleanliness standards at blood
collection stations and instituting measures which limit illegal selling of
blood. As the operation of the plasma stations become more regulated and the
donor population expands, we believe that the overall quality of raw materials,
such as human albumin will continue to increase, leading to a safer, more
reliable finished product.<B> </B></P>
<P align=justify>Management estimates that in 2006, sales of plasma products in
China amounted to $1 billion, and that sale of albumin amounted to about $593
million, or approximately 59% of the market for plasma products. The Plasma
derivatives market is expect to grow at 15% per year through 2011.</P>
<P align=justify>In accordance with &#147;Regulations on controlling blood products&#148;
promulgated in 1996, the retail price of certain plasma products including human
albumin, IVIG and intramuscular IG are regulated by the State Pricing Bureau and
the PRC Ministry of Health. </P>
<P align=justify>In addition to the low usage ratio between China and other more
developed countries, there is also a significant difference in the make up and
range of the plasma-based pharmaceutical products. Based on our analysis, in
most developed countries like the United States, clotting factor products
accounts for the majority of the plasma-based biopharmaceutical products, while
in China, human albumin products accounts for the vast majority of such
products. Specifically, total clotting factor products and human albumin
products, account for approximately 40% and 25%, respectively, of total the
United States&#146; annual plasma-derived products, and account for approximately 8%
and 62%, respectively, of China. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Plasma Collection in China</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Substantially all plasma donations for commercialized
plasma-based biopharmaceutical products are done through plasmapheresis donation
stations. Plasmapheresis donation means donors give only selected blood
components &#151; platelets, plasma, red cells, infection-fighting white cells called
granulocytes, or a combination of these, depending on donors blood type and the
needs of the community. Plasmapheresis stations in China are commonly used to
collect plasma. In China, current regulations only allow an individual donor to
donate blood in 14-day intervals, with a maximum quantity of 580ml (or about 600
gram) per donation. </P>
<P align=justify>The following are the regulatory requirements to establish a
plasmapheresis station in China: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt">meet the overall plan in terms of the total number, distribution, and

  <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt">have the equipment and quality control technicians to ensure the quality
  of the plasma collected. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>As a result of the overhaul by the four ministries of the State
Council in May 2004, we estimate that the number of collection stations
(including plasma stations) that meet the standards imposed by the PRC has been
reduced from approximately 156 to approximately 120. Plasma stations are
customarily owned and managed by the PRC health authorities. In March 2006, the
Ministry of Health promulgated the Blood Collection Measures whereby the
ownership and management of the plasma stations must be transferred to
plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies while the regulatory supervision and
administrative control remain with the government. For those plasma stations
which do not complete their reform by December 31, 2006, their license to
collect plasma will be revoked. </P>
<P align=justify>Under normal circumstances, each station can only supply plasma
to the one manufacturer that has signed the &#147;Quality Responsibility&#148; statement
with them. In addition, the manufacturer is prohibited from sourcing plasma
outside its approved list of plasma station suppliers. In the event of a supply
shortage, the manufacturer can apply to the provincial health authorities to
source plasma from other stations within the province. Moreover, if the
manufacturer wishes to source plasma from stations outside of the province, it
must first file for approval by the local provincial health authorities. The
filing must be accompanied by a report on the status of the station. The station
must also file with the local provincial health authorities on the transfer of
excess plasma. The filing must be accompanied by a report on the status of the
manufacturer. Upon approval of both provincial health authorities to the
transfer, they must separately file for approval with the State Ministry of
Health. The transfer is only legal after approval by the Ministry of Health. We
believe that although there are such practices in the market, outside sourcing
is not prevalent because (i) the manufacturer has to identify the station that
has excess supply; (ii) the station must be willing to supply to such
manufacturer, and (iii) the local provincial health authorities and the Ministry
of Health have to approve such an arrangement. </P>

  the plasma stations in Shandong Province to acquire certain of their assets
  and we acquired those plasma stations in December 2006. Furthermore, in
  January 2007, we entered into three letters of intent to acquire certain

  revoked by the regulators, making them potential targets for acquisition.
  Also, if we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may acquire
  additional companies, products or technologies in the biologic related sectors

<P align=justify><SUP>1.</SUP> &#147; %&#148; represents the degree of dosage
concentration for the product and each product has its own dosage requirement.
For example, Human Albumin 20%/10ml means 2g of Human Albumin is contained in
each 10ml packaging and Human Immunoglobulin 10%/3ml means 300mg of Human
Immunoglobulin is contained in each 3ml packaging. Under PRC law, each variation
in the packaging, dosage and concentration of medical products requires
registration and approval by the SFDA. During this process the altered product
is not commercially available for sale. For example, among our Human Albumin
products only Human Albumin 20%/10ml, 20%/25ml and 20%/50ml products are
currently approved and are commercially available. </P>
<P align=justify><SUP>2.</SUP> &#147;IU&#148; means International Units, or IU. IU is a
unit used to measure the activity of many vitamins, hormones, enzymes, and
drugs. An IU is the amount of a substance that has a certain biological effect.
For each substance there is an international agreement on the biological effect
that is expected for 1 IU. In the case of Immunoglobulin, it means the number of
effective units of antibodies in each package. When exposed to an antigen, the
body views it as foreign material, and takes steps to neutralize the antigen.
Typically, the body accomplishes this by making antibodies, which are intended
to defend the body from invasion by potentially dangerous substances. These
antibodies can be beneficial, as is the case when the body learns to fight a
virus, or they can be harmful, in the instance of allergies. In a situation when
the body cannot effectively react with these antigens, injection of our product
will provide sufficient antibodies to neutralize the antigens. </P>
<P align=justify><SUP>3.</SUP> &#147;Tetanus Antitoxin&#148; is a cheaper injection
treatment for tetanus. However it is not widely used because most people are
allergic to it. </P>
<P align=justify>Human albumin is principally used to increase blood volume
while immunoglobulin is used for certain disease preventions and cures. Albumin
is also used to treat critically ill patients by replacing lost fluid and
maintaining adequate blood volume and pressure. Our approved human albumin and
immunoglobulin products use human plasma as the basic raw material. All of our
approved products are prescription medicines administered in the form of
injections. </P>
<P align=justify>Under PRC law, each variation in the packaging, dosage and
concentration of medical products requires registration and approval by the
SFDA. During this process the altered product is not commercially available for
sale. For example, among our human albumin products only Human Albumin 20%/10ml,
20%/25ml and 20%/50ml products are currently approved and are commercially
available. Accordingly, all references, in this annual report, to our
manufacture and sale of human albumin relate to our approved human albumin
products. </P>
<P align=justify>We have product liability insurance covering all of our
products in the amount of approximately $2,934,000 (RMB 20,000,000). However,
since our establishment in 2002, there has not been any product liability claims
nor has any legal action been filed against us by patients related to the use of
our products. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Raw Materials </B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Plasma </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Plasma is the principal raw material for our biopharmaceutical
products. The cost of raw materials included in our cost of sales for 2008 and
2007, were $14.0 million and $9.2 million, respectively. We completed the
acquisitions of six plasma stations in Shandong Province by the end of
2007.There are currently six plasma stations in the Shandong Province, five of
which we have recently acquired. In April 2007, we acquired certain assets of
two more plasma stations and signed letter of intent with one plasma station in
the Guangxi Province, two of which already have the necessary permit to operate. When our
production requirements exceed the plasma supply from the stations that we own
or that we will acquire in the future, we will procure the supply deficiency
from the blood centers operated by the regulators of Shandong and other
Provinces.<B> </B> </P>
<P align=center>10 </P>
<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center width="100%" color=black
noShade SIZE=5>
<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_14></A>
<P align=justify>We currently maintain sufficient plasma supply for
approximately 90 days of production. In March 2007, the PRC Food and Drug
Administration implemented new measures on biopharmaceutical industry effective
as of July 1, 2008, requiring plasma raw material to be kept for at least 3
months before being put into production. As such, in due course we will extend
our plasma supply for approximately 4 months. We have not experienced any
interruptions to our production due to shortage of plasma. <B></B></P>
<P align=justify>As discussed above under the caption &#147;Our Industry,&#148; up until
the end of 2006, all the stations were owned by the PRC government. In March
2006, the Ministry of Health promulgated the Blood Collection Measures, whereby
the ownership and management of the plasma stations must be transferred to
plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies while the regulatory supervision and
administrative control remain with the government. In June 2006, we entered into
letters of intent with five plasma stations in Shandong. We acquired certain
assets of these five plasma stations during December 2006 and received the
permit to operate them in January 2007. The acquisition was for the assets and
the associated liabilities with consideration determined based on the valuation
by a qualified appraiser in China with reference to the attributable net asset
value of the purchased interest. The aggregate consideration for these five
plasma acquisitions amounted to RMB19.3 million (approximately $2.5 million);
RMB17.2 million (approximately $2.2 million) of which was paid prior to December
2007. <B></B></P>
<P align=justify>In January 2007, we entered into letters of intent with three
plasma stations in Guangxi Province, two of which we have since acquired for an
aggregate consideration of RMB5.6 million (approximately $0.8 million). However,
there is a legal dispute between the owner of the third plasma station and a
third party and there can be no assurance that its acquisition can be completed on
the terms in the original letter of intent. For details regarding this dispute,
please see our disclosure regarding the Bobai County Collection Station case
under the &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; heading. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that the acquisitions and contemplated acquisitions
of plasma stations will result in several benefits to the Company. We will have
a controlled source of plasma and will be able to oversee the quality and
quantity produced. We will also be able to have increased control over the cost
of plasma. Finally, we believe that we will enjoy benefits of economies of scale
with respect to the administration and management expenses of our several plasma
stations. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Other Raw Materials and Packaging Materials </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Other raw materials used in the production of our
biopharmaceutical products include: reagents, consumables and packaging
materials. The principal packaging materials we use include glass bottles for
our injection products, external packaging and printed instructions for our
biopharmaceutical products. We acquire our raw materials and packaging materials
from our approved suppliers in China and overseas. We select our suppliers based
on quality, consistency, price and delivery of the raw materials which they
supply. </P>
<P align=justify>We have not experienced any shortage of supply on these raw
materials and packaging materials and there has not been any significant problem
with the quality of materials supplied by these suppliers. </P>

<P align=justify>Prior to our acquisition of the assets of Qi He, Xiajin and
Zhang Qiu, we had entered into material supply agreements with them for the
purchase of raw materials. We have replaced these material supply agreements
with plasma processing agreements, dated January 2, 2007, between Shandong
Taibang and each of Qi He, Xia Jin and Zhang Qiu, pursuant to which we formally
appointed each of these stations as our agent to purchase, collect, examine and
deepfreeze plasma on behalf of Shandong Taibang, subject to rules and
specifications that meet the State Province Food and Drug Administration&#146;s
requirements for quality, packaging and storage. Pursuant to the plasma
processing agreements, the stations must only collect plasma from healthy donors
within their respective districts and in accordance with a time table set by
Shandong Taibang. The plasma must: be negative HbsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV and
reaction of serum to RPR; contain an ALT &#8804;25 units (ALT), plasma protein &#8805;55g/l;
contain no virus pollution or visible erythrolysis, lipemia, macroscopic red
blood cell or any other irregular finding. In addition, the plasma must be
packaged in 25 separate 600g bags, boxed with a packing list and labeled to be
consistent with computer records and must be stored at -20&#176;C as soon as possible
after collection to ensure that it will congeal within 6 hours. Shandong Taibang
is fully responsible for the overall technical guidance and quality supervision.
Shandong Taibang pays each of the stations a rate of RMB15 (approximately $2.0)
per bag of plasma collected, with the payment for each batch due within 10 days
after the delivery of the following batch of plasma. Each of the plasma
processing agreements with Qi He, Xia Jin and Zhang Qiu, will all expire on
December 31, 2011. </P>

<P align=justify><B>Sales, Marketing and Distribution </B></P>
<P align=justify>Because all of our products are prescription drugs, we can only
sell to hospitals and inoculation centers directly or through approved
distributors. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, direct sales to
distributors represented approximately 65.6% and 58.3%, respectively, of our
revenues. </P>
<P align=justify>Our five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for
approximately 16.2% and 14.9% of our total revenues for the years ended December
31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our largest customer accounted for
approximately 6.2% and 5.3% of our total revenues for the years ended December
31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. </P>
<P align=justify>As part of our effort to ensure the quality of our
distributors, we conduct due diligence to verify whether potential distributors
have obtained necessary permits and licenses and facilities (such as cold
storage) for the distribution of our biopharmaceutical products. We also assess
the distributors&#146; financial condition before appointing them as distributors. We
normally enter into annual supply contracts with our hospital customers and
regional distributors. Certain of our regional distributors are appointed on an
exclusive basis within a specified area. The supply contracts normally set out
the quantity and price of products. For distributors, they also contain
guidelines for the sale and distribution of our products, including restrictions
on the geographical area to which the products could be sold. We provide our
distributors with training in relation to our products and on sales techniques.
We have implemented a coding system for our products for easy tracking.
Depending on the relationship and the creditability of the distributors, we
generally grant a credit period of no longer than 30 days to distributors with
some exceptions. For hospitals and clinics, we generally grant a credit period
of no longer than 90 days. We have bad debt credit of $0.1 million for 2008 and
bad debt expense of $0.2 million for 2007. The $0.1 million bad debt credit for
2008 is due to recovery of bad debt previously reserved. </P>
<P align=justify>Our current key market is in Shandong province, representing
approximately 48.1% and 42.0% of our total revenues for the years ended December
31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our strategy is to focus our market marketing
efforts in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan and the northeastern part of China. </P>
<P align=justify>Our marketing and after-sales services department currently
employs approximately 56 employees. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that due to the unique nature of our products, the
key emphasis on our marketing efforts centers on product safety, brand
recognition, timely availability and pricing. As all of our products are
prescription medicines, we are not allowed to advertise our products in the mass
media. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, total sales and marketing
expenses amounted to approximately $2.2 million and $4.4 million, respectively,
representing approximately 4.7% and 13.7%, respectively, of our revenues. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Our Research and Development Efforts </B></P>
<P align=justify>Shandong Taibang&#146;s predecessor, the Shandong Institute, was
established in 1971. The Shandong Institute is the research arm established by
and directly administrated by the Shandong Provincial health department. It was
the only entity approved for the research, development and production of
biological and plasma-based biopharmaceutical products in Shandong Province, the
second largest province in China. Since 1998, it promoted GMP management in the
production process of blood products and became one of the first blood products

<P align=justify>* Under PRC law, each variation in the packaging, dosage and
concentration of medical products requires registration and approval by the
SFDA. During this process the altered product is not commercially available for
sale. For example, among our Human Albumin products only Human Albumin 20%/10ml,
20%/25ml and 20%/50ml products are currently approved and are commercially
available. Our Human Albumin 12.5g/vial product is at Stage 9 of the drug
approval process, i.e. we are awaiting the SFDA&#146;s approval. Accordingly, all
references, in this annual report, to our manufacture and sale of Human Albumin
relates to our approved Human Albumin products. </P>
<P align=justify>** These stages refer to the stages in the regulatory approval
process for our products disclosed under the heading &#147;Regulation&#148; in this annual
report. </P>
<P align=justify>For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, total
research and development expenses amounted to approximately $1.2 million and
$0.6 million, respectively, representing approximately 2.5% and 1.9%,
respectively, of our revenues. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Our Competition</B> </P>
<P align=justify>We are subject to intense competition. There are both local and
overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale
of potential substitute or similar biopharmaceutical products as our products in
the PRC. These competitors may have more capital, better research and
development resources, manufacturing and marketing capability and experience
than us. In our industry, we compete based upon product quality, product cost,
ability to produce a diverse range of products and logistical capabilities. Our
profitability may be adversely affected if (i) competition intensifies; (ii)
competitors drastically reduce prices; or (iii) competitors develop new products
or product substitutes having comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic
effects which are more effective and /or less costly than those produced by us.
</P>
<P align=justify>Other approved biopharmaceutical manufacturers in the PRC are
entitled to produce many of the products produced by us. There are currently
about 32 approved manufacturers of plasma-based pharmaceutical products in
China. Many of these manufacturers are essentially producing the same type of
products that we produce: human albumin and various types of immunoglobulin.
However, due to recent Ministry of Health regulations, we believe that it is
difficult for new manufacturers to enter into the industry. We believe that our
major competitors in the albumin and immunoglobulin market in China are Hua Lan
Biological Engineering, Shanghai Institute of Biological Products, Shanghai RAAS
Blood Products Co. Ltd., Chengdu Ronsheng Pharmaceuticals, and Sichuan Yuanda
Shuyang Pharmaceutical Co. </P>
<P align=justify>In addition, competition from imported products and China&#146;s
admission as a member of the WTO creates increased competition. The PRC became a
member of the WTO in December 2001. Competition in the biopharmaceutical
industry in the PRC will intensify generally in two respects. With lower import
tariffs, we anticipate that imported biopharmaceutical products manufactured
overseas may become increasingly competitive with domestically produced products
in terms of pricing. We also believe that well-established foreign
biopharmaceutical manufacturers may set up production facilities in the PRC and
compete with domestic manufacturers directly. With the expected increased supply
of competitively priced biopharmaceutical products in the PRC, we may face with
increased competition from foreign biopharmaceutical products, including the
types of products manufactured by US manufacturers and other manufacturers. </P>
<P align=justify>According to a 2006 Hua Yuan Medicine Net survey of the profit
ranking of companies in the Chinese biological products industry, we are ranked
the 20<SUP>th</SUP> in 2006 and 25<SUP>th</SUP> in 2005, and in the plasma
products area, we were ranked 5<SUP>th</SUP> in 2006. We believe that we have
maintained the same ranking in 2008 based on our analysis data regarding the
approval for sales of plasma-derived products published by China National
Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products throughout
of the year. Our past financial performance is attributable to our market
position in the industry. Furthermore, while each of the plasma products related
companies have their own product composition which include 3 main categories
namely human albumin, human immunoglobulin and lyophilized human factor, we are
currently developing lyophilized human factor products which we expect to launch
in 2009. We will continue to meet challenges and secure our market position by
enhancing our existing products, introducing new products to meet customer
demand, delivering quality products to our customers in a timely manner and
maintaining our established industry reputation.<B> </B></P>

<P align=justify><B>Regulation </B></P>
<P align=justify>Due to the nature of our products, we are supervised by various
levels of the PRC Ministry of Health and/or Food and Drug Administration. Such
supervision includes the safety standards regulating our source supplies (mainly
plasma), our manufacturing process through the issuance of our GMP Certification
and the inspection of our finished products. </P>
<P align=justify>In addition, there are regulations regarding the retail price,
rather than regulations of wholesale prices, of our products. According to the
&#147;Regulations on controlling blood products&#148; promulgated by the State Council in
1996, the price (retail) setting standard and regulatory functions reside with
regional offices of the Pricing Bureau and the Ministry of Health. Presently,
there are retail pricing guidelines for hospitals which sell our human albumin
and immunoglobulin products to patients as prescribed by the relevant regulators
in each region. The retail pricing guidelines are established based on, amongst
other things, the regional living standards and the cost of production of the
manufacturers. </P>
<P align=justify>The hospitals cannot sell the products to patients at prices
exceeding the highest retail price prescribed by the relevant regulators. There
is no pricing guideline on the ex-factory price to the hospital and the
distributors. The highest retail price guideline is revised occasionally. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Our Employees </B></P>
<P align=justify>As of December 31, 2008, we employed approximately 753
full-time employees, including the recently established plasma companies and
Shandong Medical, of which approximately 131 were seconded to us by the Shandong
Institute. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship
with our employees and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or
any difficulties in recruiting staff for our operations. </P>
<P align=justify>As required by applicable Chinese law, we have entered into
employment contracts with most of our officers, managers and employees. We are
working towards entering into employment contracts with those employees who do
not currently have employment contracts with us. </P>
<P align=justify>The PRC enacted a new Labor Contract Law, which became
effective on January 1, 2008. We have updated our employment contracts and
employee handbook and are in compliance with the new law. We will work with the
employees and the labor union to insure that our employees obtain the full
benefit of the law. We do not anticipate that changes in the law will materially
impact our balance sheet and cash flows. </P>
<P align=justify>Our employees in China participate in a state pension plan
organized by Chinese municipal and provincial governments. We are required to
contribute to the plan at the rates ranging of the average monthly salary of
20%. The compensation expenses related to this plan were $220,493 and $171,802
for the fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other major contributions
include medical insurance (7%), unemployment insurance (2%) and housing provision fund (8%) for employees seconded from the
Shandong Institute. In addition, we are required by Chinese law to cover
employees in China with various types of social insurance. We have purchased
social insurances for all of our employees. </P>

<P align=justify style="margin-left: 10%; margin-top: -25.5pt"><B>RISK FACTORS. </B></P>
<P align=justify><B>RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS </B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We face risks related to general domestic and global
economic conditions and to the current credit crisis.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We currently generate sufficient operating cash flows, which
combined with access to the credit markets, provide us with significant
discretionary funding capacity. However, the current uncertainty arising out of
domestic and global economic conditions, including the recent disruption in
credit markets, poses a risk to the economies in which we operate and may impact
our ability to manage normal relationships with our customers, suppliers and
creditors. In addition, the demand for our products is largely affected by the
general economic conditions in China as our products are still not affordable to
many patients. As China&#146;s economy grows, we expect more Chinese people will
become consumers of medical treatments and procedures, including procedures
requiring human plasma. However, we expect that the current global economic
slowdown will result in slower economic growth in China and a depressed economic
environment which in turn may make our products less affordable to more patients
and result in an overall decreased demand for our products. Such reductions and
disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.
</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>In order to grow at the pace expected by management, we
will require additional capital to support our long-term business plan. If we
are unable to obtain additional capital in future years, we may be unable to
proceed with our long-term business plan and we may be forced to curtail or
cease our operations or further business expansion. </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We will require additional working capital to support our
long-term business plan, which includes identifying suitable targets for
horizontal or vertical mergers or acquisitions, so as to enhance the overall
productivity and benefit from economies of scale. Our working capital
requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities, if any,
will vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the volume of business
during the period and payment terms with our customers. We may not be able to
obtain adequate levels of additional financing, whether through equity
financing, debt financing or other sources, especially in light of the current
global financial crisis and the market downturn. To raise funds, we may need to
issue new equities or bonds which could result in additional dilution to our
shareholders and in. Additional financings could result in significant dilution
to our earnings per share or the issuance of securities with rights superior to
our current outstanding securities or contain covenants that would restrict our
operations and strategy. In addition, we may grant registration rights to
investors purchasing our equity or debt securities in the future. If we are
unable to raise additional financing, we may be unable to implement our
long-term business plan, develop or enhance our products and services, take
advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures on a
timely basis, if at all. In addition, a lack of additional financing could force
us to substantially curtail or cease operations. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>If the PRC government bans or limits plasma-based
biopharmaceutical products, our operations, revenues and profitability would be
adversely affected. </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The principal raw materials of our existing and planned
biopharmaceutical products is human source plasma, which, due to its unique
nature, is subject to various quality and safety control issues which include,
but are not limited to, contaminations and blood-born diseases. In addition,
limitations of current technology pose biological hazards inherent in plasma
that have yet to be discovered which could result in a wide spread epidemic due
to blood infusion. The primary law that regulates plasma products in China is
the PRC Pharmaceutical Law, the Implementation Rules on the PRC Pharmaceutical
Law and the Regulations on the Administration of Blood Products. These rules and
regulations require entities producing blood products to strictly comply with
certain hygienic standards and specifications promulgated by the government. In
the event that human plasma is discovered to be noncompliant with the
government&#146;s hygienic standards and specifications, the health department may revoke the registration and/or the approval of the blood
product, or otherwise limit the use of such blood product. If the PRC government
bans or limits plasma-based biopharmaceutical products, our operations, revenues
and profitability would be adversely affected. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>If the plasma from Shandong Province are found to be
contaminated, or the supply from these plasma stations becomes restricted, our
operation, revenues and profitability would be adversely affected.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We currently source plasma mainly from human donations to our
plasma stations in Shandong and Guangxi Provinces. If any of our human donors is
infected with certain diseases, then the plasma from such donor may be infected.
If such contaminated plasma is not appropriately screened out, our entire plasma
source may become contaminated. If the plasma from these collection stations are
found to be contaminated or the supply from these plasma stations becomes
restricted, our operation, revenues and profitability would be adversely
affected. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>If we are unable to adequately monitor our plasma
stations in Shandong Province and Guangxi Province our plasma supply may be
tainted and we will be subject to sanctions by the government which would have a
material adverse effect on our business.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>As part of the industry reform initiative by the Chinese
government, in 2006 we acquired the assets of five of the six then existing
plasma stations in Shandong Province through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Xia
Jin Plasma Company, the Qi He Plasma Company, the He Ze Plasma Company, the
Zhang Qiu Plasma Company and the Yang Gu Plasma Company. We received permits to
operate these subsidiaries in January 2007. In April 2007, we acquired the
assets of two additional plasma stations, one through our newly formed
subsidiary, the Huan Jiang Plasma Company, and the other through our majority
owned subsidiary, the Fang Cheng Plasma Company, which is 80% owned by Shandong
Taibang and 20% owned by Lin Feng, an unrelated third party. We obtained
necessary permits and commenced their operation in July and August 2007,
respectively. While we establish plasma processing procedures through processing
agreements with our plasma stations and monitor our blood plasma intake
procedures through frequent unscheduled inspections of our stations, there
remains a risk that our blood supply may become tainted during the collection
process. Our blood supply may become tainted if we accept blood from donors
whose blood shows any irregular findings including HIV, Hepatitis C and liver
disease. We pre-screen all donors in order to ensure that this criteria is met.
If our blood supply becomes tainted, the consequences for our business could be
severe. We could be subject to civil liability from suits brought by consumers
and to criminal liability and loss of our registration if we are found by the
government to have been criminally negligent. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our operations, sales, profit and cash flow will be
adversely affected if our albumin products fail inspection or are delayed by
regulators.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Each batch of our albumin products requires inspection by
Chinese government regulators before we can ship it to our customers. The PRC
State Food and Drug Authority, or the SFDA, has a quality standard which
considers, among other things, the appearance, packing capacity, thermal
stability, pH value, protein content and percentage of purity of the product. In
order to pass inspection, our plasma must test negative for any blood
irregularities, including Hepatitis C, HIV and liver disease. The plasma must be
packaged in 25 separate 600g bags and boxed with a packing list and labeled to
be consistent with computer records. The plasma must then be stored at -20&#176;C as
soon as possible after collection to ensure that it will congeal within 6 hours.
Government regulators usually take one month to inspect a batch of albumin
products. The process begins when the regulator randomly selects samples of our
albumin products and delivers them to the National Institute for the Control of
Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, or the NICBPB, in Beijing for testing,
and the process ends when the products are given final approval by the NICBPB.
In the event that the regulators delay the approval of our products, change the
requirements in such a way that we are unable to comply with those requirements,
or require our other products to be inspected by regulators before we can ship
them to our customers, our operations, sales, profit and cash flow will be
adversely affected. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>We rely on a Secondment Agreement with the Shandong
Institute, which is expected to terminate before the end of 2008 upon the
privatization of the Shandong Institute, for over 39% of our Shandong Taibang
employees. If the Secondment Agreement is breached or terminated, it
could have an adverse effect on our operations and on our financial
results.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>The Shandong Province Institute of Biological Products, or the
Shandong Institute, has provided us with approximately 131 of our employees out
of a total of approximately &#150; 753 employees, pursuant to a secondment agreement,
or Secondment Agreement, dated October 28, 2002, between Shandong Taibang and
the Shandong Institute. Pursuant to the Secondment Agreement, we are responsible
for the salaries of these employees, as well as for their social benefits such
as insurance. Our Secondment Agreement with the Shandong Institute will expire
on the sooner to occur of October 2032 or upon the privatization of the Shandong
Institute, which was originally expected to occur before the end of 2008.
However, the completion of privatization of Shandong Institute has been further
delayed indefinitely due to slower action taken by the Shandong Ministry of
Health in implementing the privatization plan. Upon expiration or termination of
the Secondment Agreement, we plan to hire the seconded employees directly.
However, we cannot be sure that all of the employees will accept our employment
offers at that time. Guang Li Pang, Shandong Taibang&#146;s Deputy Chief Executive
Officer, Yun Hua Gao and Dian Cong Liu, our Senior Technical Advisors are
employed through the Secondment Agreement. Although none of our seconded
employees have indicated that they do not plan to continue working for our
Company after the privatization, if the Secondment Agreement is terminated or
expires and we are unable to hire replacement employees on time, our operations,
as well as our financial results, may suffer. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>If the distributors who we rely on do not purchase our
products, our business and results of operations will be adversely
affected.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We sell all of our products in China through our network of
about 397 distributors located in about 27 provinces and municipal cities
throughout China. While we have established working relationships with many of
our distributors and strictly regulate their sales and marketing activities by
annual distribution agreements, there are no restrictions in these distribution
agreements preventing our distributors from also supplying products produced by
our competitors. Our own marketing and sales staff work to develop and maintain
relationships with our distributors, but there can be no assurance that we will
be able to maintain such relationships. For the years ended December 31, 2008
and 2007, direct sales to distributors represented approximately 65.6% and
58.3%, respectively, of our total revenues. If a number of our distributors
cease to purchase our products and we are unable to find suitable replacement,
our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our inability to successfully research and develop
new</I></B> <B><I>biological pharmaceutical products could have an adverse
effect on our future growth.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that the successful development of biological
pharmaceutical products can be affected by many factors. Products that appear to
be promising in the early phases of research and development may fail to be
commercialized for various reasons, including the failure to obtain the
necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, the research and development cycles
for new medicine for which we must obtain a Certificate of New Medicine from the
PRC Ministry of Health, is a relatively lengthy process. In our experience, the
process of conducting research and various tests on new products before
obtaining a Certificate of New Medicine and subsequent procedures may take
approximately three to five years. There is no assurance that our future
research and development projects will be successful or that they will be
completed within the anticipated time frame or budget. Also, there is no
guarantee that we will receive the necessary approvals from relevant authorities
for the production of our newly developed products. Even if such products could
be successfully commercialized, there is no assurance that they will be accepted
by the market as anticipated. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our financial position and operations may be materially
and adversely affected, if our product liability insurance does not sufficiently
cover our liabilities.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Under current PRC laws, manufacturers and vendors of defective
products in the PRC may incur liability for loss and injury caused by such
products. Pursuant to the General Principles of the Civil Law of the PRC or the
PRC Civil Law, which became effective in 1987, a defective product which causes
property damage or physical injury to any person may subject the manufacturer or
vendor of such product to civil liability. </P>

<P align=justify>In 1993, the PRC promulgated the Product Quality Law of the PRC
or the Product Quality Law, which was revised in 2000. The Product Quality Law
was enacted to protect the rights and interests of end-users and consumers and
to strengthen the supervision and control of the quality of products. Under the
Product Quality Law, manufacturers who produce defective products may be subject
to fines and required to cease production, and in severe cases, be subject to
criminal liability and may have their business licenses revoked. </P>
<P align=justify>In 1993, the Law of the PRC on the Protection of the Rights and
Interests of Consumers or the Consumers&#146; Rights Law was promulgated to further
protect the legal rights and interests of consumers in connection with the
purchase or use of goods and services. All businesses, including our business,
must observe and comply with the Consumers&#146; Rights Law. </P>
<P align=justify>We maintain product liability insurance for sales in the PRC
for all of our products in the amount of approximately $2.9 million (RMB20
million). Although no one has filed any claims in relation to the use of our
pharmaceutical products, our financial position and operations may be materially

<P align=justify>Due to our limited operating history and recent additions to
our management team, certain of our senior management and employees have worked
together at our company for only a relatively short period of time.
Specifically, Chao Ming Zhao became our Chief Executive Officer in June 2008
after serving as our Chief Financial Officer since November 2006 and Y. Tristan
Kuo became our Chief Financial Officer in June 2008 and had served as our Vice
President-Finance since September 2007. Siu Ling Chan and Lin Ling Li became our
directors in July 2006. In addition, while Mr. Zhao, Ms. Chen and Ms. Lin were
employed in various capacities by Logic Express and Shandong Taibang, Mr. Kuo is
a newcomer to our Company. As a result of these circumstances, it may be
difficult for you to evaluate the effectiveness of our senior management and
other key employees and their ability to address future challenges to our
business. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Future acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our
ability to manage our business.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Selective acquisitions form part of our strategy to further
expand our business. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may
acquire additional companies, products or technologies. Future acquisitions and
the subsequent integration of new companies into ours would require significant
attention from our management. Our company has little experience with
integrating newly acquired businesses. Potential problems encountered by each
organization during mergers and acquisitions would be unique, posing additional
risks to the company. The diversion of our management&#146;s attention and any
difficulties encountered in any integration process could have an adverse effect
on our ability to manage our business. Future acquisitions would expose us to
potential risks, including risks associated with the assimilation of new
operations, technologies and personnel, unforeseen or hidden liabilities, the
diversion of resources from our existing businesses and technologies, the
inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of
acquisitions, and potential loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees,
customers and suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>We may lose our competitive advantage and our operations
may suffer if we fail to prevent the loss or misappropriation of, or disputes
over, our intellectual property.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>None of our products are currently covered by patents, except
for the trademark &#147;Lu Yue&#148; that has been licensed to us by the Shandong
Institute for our use as in the labeling of human-use medicine, biopreparate and
blood products, pursuant to a trademark license agreement, dated February 27,
2007. We plan to apply for patents for our manufacturing processes. The patent
application will be subject to approval from the relevant PRC authorities. We
may not be able to successfully obtain the approval of the PRC authorities for
our patent applications. Furthermore, third parties may assert claims to our
proprietary procedures, technologies and systems. These proprietary procedures,
technologies and systems are important to our business as they allow us to
maintain our competitive edge over our competitors. </P>
<P align=justify>While we are not aware of any infringement on our intellectual
property and we have not been notified by any third party that we are infringing
on their intellectual property, our ability to compete successfully and to
achieve future revenue growth will depend, in significant part, on our ability
to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the
intellectual property rights of others. The legal regime in China for the
protection of intellectual property rights is still at its early stage of
development. Intellectual property protection became a national effort in China
in 1979 when China adopted its first statute on the protection of trademarks.
Since then, China has adopted its Patent Law, Trademark Law and Copyright Law
and promulgated related regulations such as Regulation on Computer Software
Protection, Regulation on the Protection of Layout Designs of Integrated
Circuits and Regulation on Internet Domain Names. China has also acceded to
various international treaties and conventions in this area, such as the Paris
Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, Patent Cooperation Treaty,
Madrid Agreement and its Protocol Concerning the International Registration of
Marks. In addition, when China became a party to the World Trade Organization in
2001, China amended many of its laws and regulations to comply with the
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Despite many
laws and regulations promulgated and other efforts made by China over the years
with a view to tightening up its regulation and protection of intellectual
property rights, private parties may not enjoy intellectual property rights in
China to the same extent as they would in many Western countries, including the
United States, and enforcement of such laws and regulations in China have not
achieved the levels reached in those countries. Both the administrative agencies
and the court system in China are not well-equipped to deal with violations or
handle the nuances and complexities between compliant technological innovation
and non-compliant infringement. </P>
<P align=justify>We rely on confidentiality agreements with our management and
employees to protect our confidential proprietary information. However, the
protection of our intellectual properties may be compromised as a result of:
</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt">departure of any of our management members or employees in possession of
  our confidential proprietary information;

  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt">refusal by relevant regulatory authorities to approve our patent or
  trademark applications. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>Any of these events or occurrences may have a material adverse
effect on our operations and the measures that we have put into place to protect
our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient. Litigation to enforce
our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and may not
be successful. If we are not able to successfully defend our intellectual
property rights, we might lose rights to technology that we need to conduct and
develop our business. This may seriously harm our business, operating results
and financial condition, and enable our competitors to use our intellectual
property to compete against us. </P>
<P align=justify>Furthermore, if third parties claim that our products infringe
their patents or other intellectual property rights, we may be required to
devote substantial resources to defend against such claims. If we are
unsuccessful in defending against such infringement claims, we may be required to pay
damages, modify our products or suspend the production and sale of such
products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to modify our products on
commercially reasonable terms. </P>

<P align=justify>Mr. Zu Ying Du was one of the original equity holders in our

among the original equity holders, Mr. Du was obligated to make a capital
contribution of RMB20 million (or approximately $2.6 million) for a 25% interest
in Shandong Taibang. Mr. Du made this contribution using funds borrowed from the
Beijing Chen Da Technology Investment Company, or Beijing Chen Da. Mr. Du failed
to repay Beijing Chen Da for his loan of the capital contribution amount. Mr. Du
disputes that the money was due and owing. A Beijing court found that Beijing
Chen Da had given money to Mr. Du but found that the loan agreement failed to
comply with Chinese law. A notice was issued on July 5, 2004 by the Shenzhen
Public Security Bureau Economic Crime Investigation Unit requesting a stay of
the Beijing action pending their investigation into money laundering relating to
the 20 million RMB loan to Zu Ying Du. </P>
<P align=justify>Subsequently, Beijing Chen Da entered into an equity transfer
agreement with Mr. Du, pursuant to which Mr. Du&#146;s 25% equity interest in
Shandong Taibang was transferred to Beijing Chen Da as repayment of the RMB20
million debt. This agreement was signed by Mr. Du&#146;s brother who held a power of
attorney from Mr. Du. Mr. Du disputes the legitimacy of this transfer and has
argued that his brother, Du Hai Shan, exceeded the scope of the power of
attorney. Mr. Du sued his brother in the court of Jianli County, Hubei province,
relating to the propriety of the brother&#146;s actions under the power of attorney.
Initially the county court found in its judgment that the act had exceeded the
scope of the power of attorney. Subsequently the Intermediate Court of Jingzhou

patent technology. It was obligated to obtain new drug certificate and
production license of its patent technology from the government within a
stipulated period in order to be recognized as a valid capital contribution, or
in the alternative, make a cash payment. The patent technology was valued as
RMB26.4 million (or approximately $3.4 million). However, Missile Engineering
failed to obtain the new drug certificate and production license within the
stipulated period. Mr. Du also disputes whether the period for obtaining the
certificate and license had expired. Pursuant to a stockholders resolution on
September 26, 2004, Missile Engineering agreed to sell its 41% interest in
Shandong Taibang to Up-Wing and Up-Wing agreed to take up the obligation of

approval by the Shandong Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC. In March 2006, Up-Wing sold its equity
interests in Shandong Taibang to Logic Express, our subsidiary. </P>
<P align=justify>In 2006, Missile Engineering applied for arbitration before the
China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, or CIETAC, to
challenge the effectiveness of the transfer to Up-Wing Investments Limited, of
the equity interests in Shandong Taibang formerly owned by Missile Engineering.
The equity transfer had been approved by the Shandong Provincial Department of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC. Missile
Engineering later voluntarily withdrew this application and instead applied for
administrative reconsideration of the equity transfer, but this application was
rejected by the Ministry of Commerce in 2007. Missile Engineering applied with
the District Court of Lixia District, Jinan City, Shandong province requesting
revocation of Shandong COFTEC&#146;s approval of the equity transfer to Up-wing by
Missile Engineering. Missile Engineering later voluntarily withdrew the action.
In April 2007, Logic Express initiated an arbitration proceeding before the
Shandong Tai&#146;an Arbitration Committee, to establish that Logic Express is the
lawful shareholder of Shandong Taibang. The parties to that proceeding were
Logic Express Ltd. and Shandong Taibang Biological Products Co., Ltd. The
Arbitration Committee&#146;s decision on September 6, 2007 confirmed that Logic
Express had legitimate ownership as a result of the transfer of Shandong
Taibang. Up-Wing started an action in the Intermediate Court of Tai&#146;an City,
Shandong province requesting the court to establish that Up-Wing is the lawful
shareholder of Shandong Taibang. The Intermediate Court of Tai&#146;an City, Shandong

<P align=justify><B><I>We face risks related to general domestic and global
economic conditions and to the current credit crisis.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We currently generate sufficient operating cash flows, which
combined with access to the credit markets, provide us with significant
discretionary funding capacity. However, the current uncertainty arising out of
domestic and global economic conditions, including the recent disruption in
credit markets, poses a risk to the economies in which we operate that has
impacted accounts receivable collectivity from our customers, and may impact
our ability to pay suppliers and creditors. If the current situation
deteriorates significantly, we could see a tightened cash flow position and
an abnormal amount of bad debt expenses related to the general economic slow-down,
or supplier or customer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets. Such
reductions and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business
operations. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our cash flow could be negatively affected as a result of
our extension of relatively long payment terms to customers that we believe are
credit worthy.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>As is customary in our industry, we extend relatively long
payment terms (up to six months) to customers that we believe are credit worthy.
The dollar amount of our accounts receivable and the amount of our allowance for
doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1,581,139 and
$1,268,052, respectively. The bad debt (credit) expenses for the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007 were ($56,462) and $221,813, respectively. Although
we attempt to establish appropriate reserves for our receivables, those reserves
may not prove to be adequate in view of actual levels of bad debts. The failure
of our customers to pay us timely would negatively affect our working capital,
which could in turn adversely affect our cash flow. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our limited operating history may not serve as an
adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations.</I></B>
</P>
<P align=justify>We have a limited operating history. Shandong Taibang as began
its operation in October 2002. With the rapid growth of the industry, it has
experienced a high growth rate since 2002. Furthermore, we did not acquire a
controlling interest in Shandong Taibang until September 2005. As such, our
historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating
our business, financial performance and prospects. We may not be able to achieve
a similar growth rate in future periods. Accordingly, you should not rely on our
results of operations for any prior periods as an indication of our future
performance. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We face risks associated with debt financing (including
exposure to variation in interest rates).</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Our total outstanding indebtedness, entirely comprising of
long-term bank loan, as of December 31, 2008 was $5.9 million. The interest rate
on this long-term bank loan is fixed at 7.02% per annum. Our obligations under
our existing loans have been mainly met through the cash flow from our
operations and our financing activities. We are subject to risks normally
associated with debt financing, including the risk of significant increase in
interest rates and the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet
required payment of principal and interest. In the past, cash flow from
operations had been sufficient to meet payment obligations and/or we have been
able to roll over our borrowings. There is however no assurance that we will be
able to do so in the future. We may also underestimate our capital requirements
and other expenditures or overestimate our future cash flows. In such event,
additional capital, debt or other forms of financing may be required for our
working capital. If any of the aforesaid events occur and we are unable for any
reason to raise additional capital, debt or other financing to meet our working
capital requirements, our business, operating results, liquidity and financial
position will be adversely affected. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We will incur capital expenditures in the future in
connection with our growth plans and therefore may require additional
financing.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>To grow our sales volume, we need to increase our raw material
supplies and strengthen our commitment to our research and development efforts
to accelerate new product development. We plan to solve our raw materials shortage through either the building of new plasma collection
stations or through scaling up our existing collection stations, both of which
will require substantial capital expenditures. We anticipate that our capital
expenditure for the next 12 months will be approximately $2.5 million. Such
expenditures are likely to be incurred in advance of any increase in sales. Our
revenue may not increase after these capital expenditures are incurred. This
will depend on, among other factors, on our ability to maintain or achieve high
capacity utilization rates. Any failure to increase our revenue after incurring
capital expenditure to expand production capacity will reduce our profitability. </P>

<P align=justify>All pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution enterprises
in the PRC are required to obtain from various PRC governmental authorities
certain permits and licenses, including, in the case of manufacturing
enterprises, a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit and, in the case of
distribution enterprises, a Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit. </P>
<P align=justify>We have obtained permits and licenses and the GMP certificates,
required for the manufacture of our pharmaceutical products. These permits and
licenses held by us are subject to periodic renewal and/or reassessment by the
relevant PRC Government authorities and the standards of compliance required in
relation thereto may from time to time be subject to changes. We intend to apply
for the renewal of such permits and licenses when required by applicable laws
and regulations. Any changes in compliance standards, or any new laws or
regulations that may prohibit or render it more restrictive for us to conduct
our business or increase our compliance costs may adversely affect our
operations or profitability. Any failure by us to obtain such renewals may have
a material adverse effect on the operation of our business. In addition, we may
not be able to carry on business without such permits and business licenses
being renewed. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We may encounter increased competition from both local
and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises as a result of a relaxation of the PRC
regulatory approval process for plasma-based biopharmaceutical products or due
to an ease in international trade restrictions. A change in our competitive
environment could adversely affect our profitability and prospects.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Our continued ability to compete depends on the development of
the plasma-based biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China. The
plasma-based biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China is highly
regulated by both provincial and central governments. Prior to engaging in the
collection and production of plasma products, companies such as ours are
required to obtain collection permits from the central health department and
production permits and certificates for each new product formulation from the
various provincial food and drug authorities. We have the advantage of being
already approved by the state to collect plasma from human donors and
manufacture and sell plasma-based biopharmaceutical products in Shandong
Province, and our research and development department has become familiar with
the provincial product approval process. However, although we believe that the
regulatory requirements pose a competitive barrier to entry into the
biopharmaceutical industry, over time there may be new entrants. If the
government relaxes these restrictions and allow more competitors to enter into
the market, these competitors may have more capital, better research and
development resources, manufacturing and marketing capability and experience
than us. Our profitability may be adversely affected if (i) competition
intensifies; (ii) competitors drastically reduce prices; or (iii) competitors
develop new products having comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic
effects which are more effective and /or less costly than those produced by us.
</P>
<P align=justify>In addition we expect that competition from imported products
will increase as a result of a trend towards lower import tariffs and China&#146;s
admission as a member of the WTO in December 2001. We believe that lower import
tariffs will result in more affordable pricing for imported biopharmaceutical
products manufactured overseas as compared to domestically manufactured products
such as ours. In addition, China&#146;s membership in the WTO makes it more
accessible to foreign biopharmaceutical manufacturers who may wish to set up
production facilities in the PRC and compete directly with domestic
manufacturers. The expected increased supply of both domestic and foreign
competitively priced biopharmaceutical products in the PRC will result in
increased competition. There is no assurance that our strategies to remain
competitive can be implemented successfully as scheduled or at all. Our
inability to remain competitive may have an adverse effect on our profitability
and prospects. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>If we do not receive PRC governmental approval to
increase the retail prices of certain of our biopharmaceutical products our
revenues may be adversely affected.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Retail prices of certain of our biopharmaceutical products in
the PRC are subject to the control of the relevant federal and provincial price
administration authorities. The actual price for any given price-controlled
product set by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers cannot exceed the price
ceiling imposed in accordance with the applicable government price control
rules. Only those pharmaceutical products which are included in the Insurance

<P align=justify>The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most
countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, or OECD, in many ways. For example, state-owned enterprises still
constitute a large portion of the Chinese economy and weak corporate governance
and a lack of flexible currency exchange policy still prevail in China. As a
result of these differences, we may not develop in the same way or at the same
rate as might be expected if the Chinese economy was similar to those of the
OECD member countries. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could
limit the legal protections available to you and us.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We conduct substantially all of our business through our
operating subsidiaries in the PRC. Our operating subsidiaries are generally
subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and,
in particular, laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. The PRC legal
system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for
reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC
laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to
various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since the PRC legal
system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws,
regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws,
regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections
available to you and us. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted
and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management
attention. In addition, all of our executive officers and all of our directors
are residents of China and not of the United States, and substantially all the
assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it
could be difficult for investors to affect service of process in the United
States or to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against our
Chinese operations and subsidiaries. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>You may have difficulty enforcing judgments against
us.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We are a Delaware holding company and most of our assets are
located outside of the United States. Most of our current operations are
conducted in the PRC. In addition, most of our directors and officers are
nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial
portion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As
a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the
United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in
U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws against us and our officers and directors, most of whom are not
residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are
located outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to
whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S.
courts. Our counsel as to PRC law, has advised us that the recognition and
enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures
Law. Courts in China may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance
with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between
China and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between
jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements that
provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with
the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law,
courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our
directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic
principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security or the public interest.
So it is uncertain whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a
court in the United States. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>The PRC government exerts substantial influence over the
manner in which we must conduct our business activities.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>The PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise
substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through
regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by
changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation,
import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property
and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material
compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the
central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose
new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would
require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance
with such regulations or interpretations. </P>
<P align=justify>Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any
decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a
more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the
implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic
conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest
ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.
</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Future inflation in China may inhibit our ability to
conduct business in China.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of
rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past ten
years, the rate of inflation in China has been as high as 20.7% and as low as
-2.2% . These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from
time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the
availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation
may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit
and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in
China, and thereby harm the market for our products and our company. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability
to receive and use our revenues effectively.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>The majority of our revenues will be settled in RMB and U.S.
dollars, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability
to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside
China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the
Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater
convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant
restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that
foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies
after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks in China authorized
to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of RMB for
capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to
governmental approval in China, and companies are required to open and maintain
separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. We cannot be
certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent
restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our
business and the value of our securities.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>The value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by
the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB and between those
currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated.
Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar
would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving
effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any
dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars as well as earnings
from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the
future. </P>
<P align=justify>Since July 2005, the RMB has no longer been pegged to the U.S.
dollar. Although the People&#146;s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign
exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange
rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the
U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the
future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange
rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market. </P>
<P align=justify>Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to
reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered
into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in
the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be
limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In
addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange
control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign
currencies. </P>
<P align=justify>Currently, some of our raw materials and major equipment are
imported. In the event that the U.S. dollars appreciate against RMB, our costs
will increase. If we cannot pass the resulting cost increases on to our
customers, our profitability and operating results will suffer. In addition, if
our sales to international customers grow, we will be increasingly subject to
the risk of foreign currency depreciation. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Restrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries'
ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely

<P align=justify>Substantially all of our revenues are earned by our PRC
subsidiaries. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC
subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent
company. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividend by our PRC
subsidiaries only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined
in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC
subsidiaries are also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at
least 10% of our annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC GAAP
to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches 50%
of our registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only
be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of
loans, advances or cash dividends. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC
subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our
ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to
our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the
establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject
our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to
acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our
PRC subsidiaries&#146; ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially
adversely affect us.</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>In October 2005, the PRC State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, or SAFE, issued the Notice on Relevant Issues in the Foreign Exchange
Control over Financing and Return Investment Through Special Purpose Companies
by Residents Inside China, generally referred to as Circular 75,
which required PRC residents to register with the competent local SAFE branch
before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special purpose
company, or SPV, for the purpose of engaging in an equity financing outside of
China on the strength of domestic PRC assets originally held by those residents.
Internal implementing guidelines issued by SAFE, which became public in June
2007 (known as Notice 106), expanded the reach of Circular 75 by (1) purporting
to cover the establishment or acquisition of control by PRC residents of
offshore entities which merely acquire &#147;control&#148; over domestic companies or
assets, even in the absence of legal ownership; (2) adding requirements relating
to the source of the PRC resident&#146;s funds used to establish or acquire the
offshore entity; covering the use of existing offshore entities for offshore
financings; (3) purporting to cover situations in which an offshore SPV
establishes a new subsidiary in China or acquires an unrelated company or
unrelated assets in China; and (4) making the domestic affiliate of the SPV
responsible for the accuracy of certain documents which must be filed in
connection with any such registration, notably, the business plan which
describes the overseas financing and the use of proceeds. Amendments to
registrations made under Circular 75 are required in connection with any
increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, mergers and acquisitions,
equity investment or creation of any security interest in any assets located in
China to guarantee offshore obligations, and Notice 106 makes the offshore SPV
jointly responsible for these filings. In the case of an SPV which was
established, and which acquired a related domestic company or assets, before the
implementation date of Circular 75, a retroactive SAFE registration was required
to have been completed before March 31, 2006; this date was subsequently
extended indefinitely by Notice 106, which also required that the registrant
establish that all foreign exchange transactions undertaken by the SPV and its
affiliates were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to
comply with the requirements of Circular 75, as applied by SAFE in accordance
with Notice 106, may result in fines and other penalties under PRC laws for
evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Any such failure could also
result in the SPV&#146;s affiliates being impeded or prevented from distributing
their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or
liquidation to the SPV, or from engaging in other transfers of funds into or out
of China. </P>

<P align=justify>We believe our stockholders who are PRC residents as defined in
Circular 75 have registered with the relevant branch of SAFE, as currently
required, in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions
of equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries. However, we cannot provide any
assurances that their existing registrations have fully complied with, and they
have made all necessary amendments to their registration to fully comply with,
all applicable registrations or approvals required by Circular 75. Moreover,
because of uncertainty over how Circular 75 will be interpreted and implemented,
and how or whether SAFE will apply it to us, we cannot predict how it will
affect our business operations or future strategies. For example, our present
and prospective PRC subsidiaries&#146; ability to conduct foreign exchange
activities, such as the remittance of dividends and foreign currency-denominated
borrowings, may be subject to compliance with Circular 75 by our PRC resident
beneficial holders. In addition, such PRC residents may not always be able to
complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 75. We also
have little control over either our present or prospective direct or indirect
stockholders or the outcome of such registration procedures. A failure by our
PRC resident beneficial holders or future PRC resident stockholders to comply
with Circular 75, if SAFE requires it, could subject these PRC resident
beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or
cross-border investment activities, limit our subsidiaries&#146; ability to make
distributions or pay dividends or affect our ownership structure, which could
adversely affect our business and prospects. </P>

<P align=justify>China passed a new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the New EIT
Law, and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on January 1,
2008. Under the New EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with &#147;de
facto management bodies&#148; within China is considered a &#147;resident enterprise,&#148;
meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for
enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the New EIT Law define
de facto management as &#147;substantial and overall management and control over the
production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties&#148; of the
enterprise. Because the New EIT Law and its implementing rules are new, no
official interpretation or application of this new &#147;resident enterprise&#148;
classification is available. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will
determine tax residency based on the facts of each case. </P>

<P align=justify>If the PRC tax authorities determine that China Biologic is a
&#147;resident enterprise&#148; for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of
unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the
enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well
as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean
that income such as non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise
income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the New EIT Law and its
implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would qualify
as &#147;tax-exempt income,&#148; we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be
subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control
authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance
with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are
treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally,
it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new &#147;resident
enterprise&#148; classification could result in a situation in which a 10%
withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC stockholders and
with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC stockholders from transferring our
shares. We are actively monitoring the possibility of &#147;resident enterprise&#148;
treatment for the 2009 tax year and are evaluating appropriate organizational
changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible. </P>
<P align=justify>If we were treated as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; by PRC tax
authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our
PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax. </P>

and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign
governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and
issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business. We have operations, agreements with third parties and we make sales in
China. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or
offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors
of our Company, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is
our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our
employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may
prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents or
distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held
responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil
sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively
affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the
U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA
violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. </P>

<P align=justify>Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC

Exchange or Nasdaq system. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board
may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential

accurate quotations as to the market value of the common stock. In addition, if
we failed to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various
requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter
broker-dealers from recommending or selling the common stock, which may further
affect its liquidity. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise

<P align=justify>The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define
so-called &#147;penny stocks&#148; to be an equity security that has a market price less
than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject
to certain exemptions. If our common stock becomes a &#147;penny stock&#148;, we may
become subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the Penny Stock Rule.
This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that
sell such securities to persons other than established customers and &#147;accredited
investors&#148; (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or
annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For
transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special
suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser's
written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may
affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the
ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market.
</P>
<P align=justify>For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the
rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in penny stock, of a disclosure
schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is
also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the
broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the
securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing
recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information
on the limited market in penny stock. </P>
<P align=justify>There can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify
for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock
were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section
15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any
person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds
that such a restriction would be in the public interest. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Transfers of Equity Interests</I></B><B> </B></P>
<P align=justify>Mr. Zu Ying Du was one of the original equity holders in our
operating subsidiary, Shandong Taibang. Pursuant to a joint venture agreement,
among the original equity holders, Mr. Du was obligated to make a capital
contribution of RMB20 million (or approximately $2.6 million) for a 25% interest
in Shandong Taibang. Mr. Du made this contribution using funds borrowed from the
Beijing Chen Da Technology Investment Company, or Beijing Chen Da. Mr. Du failed
to repay Beijing Chen Da for his loan of the capital contribution amount. Mr. Du
disputes that the money was due and owing. A Beijing court found that Beijing
Chen Da had given money to Mr. Du but found that the loan agreement failed to
comply with Chinese law. A notice was issued on July 5, 2004 by the Shenzhen
Public Security Bureau Economic Crime Investigation Unit requesting a stay of
the Beijing action pending their investigation into money laundering relating to
the 20 million RMB loan to Zu Ying Du. </P>
<P align=justify>On September 26, 2004, Beijing Chen Da entered into an equity
transfer agreement with Mr. Du, pursuant to which Mr. Du&#146;s 25% equity interest
in Shandong Taibang was transferred to Beijing Chen Da as repayment of the RMB20
million debt. This agreement was signed by Mr. Du&#146;s brother who held a power of
attorney from Mr. Du. This transfer was approved by Shandong COFTEC on March 17,
2005. Mr. Du disputes the legitimacy of this transfer and has argued that his
brother, Du Hai Shan, exceeded the scope of the power of attorney. Mr. Du sued
his brother in the court of Jianli County, Hubei province, relating to the
propriety of the brother&#146;s actions under the power of attorney. Initially the
county court found in its judgment that the act had exceeded the scope of the
power of attorney. Subsequently the Intermediate Court of Jingzhou City, Hubei
province, ruled on December 10, 2008 to suspend the judgment based on the
grounds that the original court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The case
is stated to be reviewed again by the Hubei Jingzhou Intermediate Court. </P>
<P align=justify>Missile Engineering, another original equity holder wholly
controlled by Mr. Du, was obligated to contribute RMB32.8 million (or $4.2
million) for a 41% interest in Shandong Taibang by means of cash, equipment and
patent technology. It was obligated to obtain a new drug certificate and
production license of its patent technology from the government within a
stipulated period in order to be recognized as a valid capital contribution, or
in the alternative, make a cash payment. The patent technology was valued as
RMB26.4 million (or approximately $3.4 million). However, Missile Engineering
failed to obtain the new drug certificate and production license within the
stipulated period. Mr. Du also disputes whether the period for obtaining the
certificate and license had expired. Pursuant to a stockholders resolution on
September 26, 2004, Missile Engineering agreed to sell its 41% interest in
Shandong Taibang to Up-Wing and Up-Wing agreed to take up the obligation of
Missile Engineering to pay the RMB26.4 million in cash. This transfer was approved by Shandong
COFTEC on March 17, 2005. Missile Engineering disputes this transaction and sued
Mr. Du&#146;s brother in the court of Jianli County, Hubei province, relating to the
propriety of the brother&#146;s actions under the power of attorney. Initially the
county court found in its judgment that the act had exceeded the scope of the
power of attorney. Subsequently the Intermediate Court of Jingzhou City, Hubei
province, ruled on December 10, 2008 to suspend the judgment based on the
grounds that the original court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The case
is stated to be reviewed again by the Hubei Jingzhou Intermediate Court. </P>

<P align=justify>In June 10, 2005, Beijing Chen Da also sold its equity interest
in Shandong Taibang to Up-Wing Investments Limited, or Up-Wing, pursuant to a
share transfer agreement, which became effective on September 2, 2005, upon
approval by the Shandong Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC. In March 2006, Up-Wing sold its equity
interests in Shandong Taibang to Logic Express, our subsidiary. </P>
<P align=justify>In 2006, Missile Engineering applied for arbitration before the
China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, or CIETAC, to
challenge the effectiveness of the transfer to Up-Wing Investments Limited, of
the equity interests in Shandong Taibang, formerly owned by Missile Engineering.
The equity transfer had been approved by the Shandong Provincial Department of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC. Missile
Engineering later voluntarily withdrew this application and instead applied for
administrative reconsideration of the equity transfer, but this application was
rejected by the Ministry of Commerce in 2007. Missile Engineering applied with
the District Court of Lixia District, Jinan City, Shandong province requesting
revocation of Shandong COFTEC&#146;s approval of the equity transfer to Up-wing by
Missile Engineering. Missile Engineering later voluntarily withdraw the action.
In April 2007, Logic Express initiated an arbitration proceeding before the
Shandong Tai&#146;an Arbitration Committee, to establish that Logic Express is the
lawful shareholder of Shandong Taibang. The parties to that proceeding were
Logic Express Ltd. and Shandong Taibang Biological Products Co., Ltd. The
Arbitration Committee&#146;s decision on September 6, 2007 confirmed that Logic
Express had legitimate ownership as a result of the transfers of Shandong
Taibang. Up-Wing started an action in the Intermediate Court of Tai&#146;an City,
Shandong province requesting the court to establish that Up-wing is the lawful
shareholder of Shandong Taibang. The intermediate court rejected the application
by Up-Wing on the basis that the same matter had been tried by the arbitration
panel. </P>
<P align=justify>Mr. Du and Missile Engineering have filed actions in the
Intermediate Court of Wuhan City, Hubei province, against the following
defendants, Du Hai Shan the brother of Mr. Du, Beijing Chen Da and Logic
Express. Mr. Du and Missile Engineering have requested that the Wuhan
Intermediate Court to restore the equity interests originally held by the
plaintiffs, 25% equity interest by Mr. Du and 41% equity interest by Missile
Engineering. The Wuhan Intermediate Court has issued preliminary orders
attaching 66% of the equity of Shandong Taibang pending the outcome of the case.

<P align=justify><B><I>Bobai County Collection Station</I></B><B> </B></P>
<P align=justify>In January 2007, the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiary, Shandong
Taibang, advanced approximately $413,697 (RMB 3.0 million) to Feng Lin, the 20%
minority shareholder in Fang Cheng Plasma Company, the Company&#146;s majority owned
subsidiary, for the purpose of establishing or acquiring a plasma collection
station. Mr. Lin and Shandong Taibang intended to establish the Bobai Kangan
Plasma Collection Co., Ltd., or Bobai, in Bobai County, Guangxi and on January
18, 2007, Shandong Taibang signed a letter of intent to acquire the assets of
the Bobai Plasma Collection Station, which was co-owned by Mr. Lin and Mr.
Keliang Huang. However, in January 2007, Hua Lan Biological Engineering Co.,
Ltd., or Hua Lan, filed suit in the District Court of Hong Qi District, Xin
Xiang City, Henan Province, alleging that Feng Lin, Keliang Huang and Shandong
Taibang established and/or sought to operate the Bobai Plasma Collection Station
using a permit for collecting and supplying human plasma in Bobai County, that
was originally granted to Hua Lan by the government of the Guangxi region,
without Hua Lan&#146;s permission. The establishment and registration of Bobai was
never realized as a result of this law suit. On January 29, 2007, on Hua Lan&#146;s
motion, the District Court entered an order to freeze funds in the amount of
approximately $386,100 (RMB3,000,000) held by the defendants in the case,
including approximately $65,750 (RMB500,000) in funds held in Shandong Taibang&#146;s
bank account in Taian City. A hearing was held on June 25, 2007 and judgment was entered against the defendants along with a $226,780
(RMB1,700,000) joint financial judgment. The Company appealed the District Court
judgment to the Henan Province High Court. In November 2007, the High Court
affirmed the judgment against the three defendants and increased the amount of
the joint financial judgment to approximately $405,954 (RMB3,000,000).

<P align=justify>In January 2008, Hua Lan enforced the judgment granted by the
High Court and the Company&#146;s bank accounts containing an aggregate of
approximately $507,270 (RMB3,700,000) were frozen and are expected to remain
unavailable until the action is resolved. Shandong Taibang has filed a separate
action against Hua Lan before the Taian City District Court to seek recovery of
any losses in connection with Hua Lan&#146;s claim and to request that the Taian City
District Court preserve Hua Lan&#146;s property or freeze up to approximately
$411,300 (RMB 3 million) of Hua Lan&#146;s assets to secure the return of such funds
to the Company. The intermediate court in Taian City accepted the application on
February 14, 2008, but the matter is still pending. Pending the outcome of the
proceedings, Shandong Taibang increased its loss contingency reserve during its
fourth quarter of 2007 from approximately $75,593 (RMB566,667) to $133,400
(RMB1,000,000) to cover its share of the enforcement of this judgment. During
the fourth quarter of 2008, full amount of the judgment, including Feng Lin and
Keliang Huang&#146;s portions of the judgment and the related fees, approximately
$456,222 (RMB 3,109,900) has been withdrawn from Shandong Taibang&#146;s account. The
Company recorded Feng Lin and Keliang Huang&#146;s portion of the judgment,
approximately $304,143 (RMB2,073,234), as receivable as a result of the
withdraw. As of December 31, 2008, the Company determined that it is unlikely
that the Company will be able to recover such receivable from those two
individuals and wrote off the receivable as bad debt expense.<B> </B></P>

marketing, distribution and sales of biologic products through our indirect
majority-owned PRC subsidiary, Shandong Taibang, established under the laws of
China. We are currently the only plasma based biopharmaceutical products
manufacturer in Shandong province approved by the government. Since our
establishment, all of our revenues have been derived primarily from the sales of
human albumin and various types of immunoglobulin. </P>
<P align=justify>Our industry is competitive and subject to numerous government
regulations. Retail prices of certain of our biopharmaceutical products in the
PRC are subject to the control of the relevant federal and provincial price
administration authorities. The actual price for any given price-controlled
product set by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers cannot exceed the price
ceiling imposed in accordance with the applicable government price control
rules. Only those pharmaceutical products which are included in the Insurance
Catalogue administered at the federal or provincial level are subject to price
control. Many competitive factors may affect our sales of products, including
product efficacy, safety, price and cost effectiveness, marketing effectiveness,
quality control and quality assurance of our manufacturing operations, and
research and development of new products. </P>
<P align=justify>We operate and manage our business as a single segment. We do
not account for the results of our operations on a geographic or other basis.
</P>
<P align=justify>During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 our revenues
were derived primarily from the sale of our approved human albumin and
immunoglobulin products. Our revenues increased 44.3%, or $14.4 million, to
$46.8 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, compared to
revenues of $32.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. Our
approved human albumin products accounted for $27.0 million, or 57.8% of our
revenues during 2008. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Proposed Acquisition of Equity Interest in Dalin
</I></B><B></B></P>
<P align=justify>On September 26, 2008, we agreed to acquire a 90% controlling
interest in Chongqing Dalin Biologic Technologies Co., Ltd., or Dalin, for a
purchase price of RMB 194,400,000 (approximately $28.4 million). Dalin owns 54%
of the equity interest in Qianfeng Biological Products Co., Ltd., or Qianfeng,
one of the largest plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies in China, located in
Guiyang, Guizhou Province. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has completed
the financial and legal due diligence investigations on Dalin and Qianfeng and
expects to close the transaction within a few months, subject to the formal
transfer of title to the Company. In January 2009, Logic Express appointed three
out of the four directors to Dalin, thereby taking control of Dalin, and on
January 16, 2009, the shareholders of Qianfeng elected four directors appointed
by Dalin as part of its seven board members. On January 17, 2009, Qianfeng's
directors elected a new management team consisting of executives appointed by
Logic Express and Dalin, including a CEO, Executive Senior Vice President, CFO
and Directors of Sales. </P>
<font SIZE="2">
<p align="justify">As part of its due diligence investigation into Dalin and
Qianfeng, the Company discovered that the indirect interest in Qianfeng that
would be acquired under Equity Transfer Agreement will be diluted. The local AIC
records show Dalin as a 54% shareholder of Qianfeng. However, Qianfeng issued
equity to certain investors pursuant to a capital increase agreement, dated May
2007. Qianfeng received the consideration for the equity, but the increase in
registered capital and issuance of the equity interest has not yet been
registered with AIC. A shareholder of Qianfeng brought a lawsuit claiming that
such shareholder&#146;s right of first refusal with respect to the new equity
issuance was violated. When the capital increase is registered with AIC, Dalin
will own about 43.3% in Qianfeng. The lawsuit brought by the Qianfeng
shareholder was decided against such shareholder, who subsequently appealed.
Therefore, Dalin&#146;s interests in Qianfeng could be diluted to as low as 41.3% as
the result of the issuance of additional equity to the shareholder, if his
appeal prevails. Even if the indirect equity interest that the Company acquires
through the proposed acquisition is diluted down to 41.3%, the Company would be
able to retain control over Qianfeng as a result of the four board membership to
the Qianfeng&#146;s board. The Company does not expect this dispute to impact its
ability to complete the acquisition.</p>
</font>
<P align=justify>Qianfeng is one of the largest plasma-based biopharmaceutical
companies in China and is the only manufacturer currently operating in Guizhou
Province. With a population of 39 million, Guizhou Province has historically
produced the highest volumes of plasma collection in China, because a higher
proportion of its population has been willing to engage in the collection
process. Guizhou Province has a total of 19 plasma collection stations in
operation, collecting approximately 1,200 tons of plasma supply every year.
Qianfeng owns 7 of these plasma collection stations, of which 6 are currently in
operation and collecting approximately 250 tons of plasma supply per year, with
an annual capacity of 400 tons. We intend to employ more advanced collection
techniques at these stations to improve yields and generate additional plasma
supply. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that Qianfeng currently controls approximately 9.5%
of the market for plasma-based biopharmaceutical products in China. Qianfeng is
in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, standards, and has been
approved by the PRC&#146;s State Food and Drug Administration or the SFDA to produce
six types of plasma-based products including Human Albumin, Human
Immunoglobulin, Human Intravenous Immunoglobulin, Human Hepatitis B
Immunoglobulin, Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin and Human Rabies Immune Globulin.

<P align=justify><B><I>Proposed Acquisition of Equity Interest in Huitian
</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>On October 10, 2008, Shandong Taibang entered into an equity
transfer agreement with Mr. Fan Qingchun, a PRC citizen holding 35% of the
equity interest in Huitian, a PRC limited liabilities company, for a price of
approximately $6,502,902 (RMB 44,327,890) including interest of $48,102 (RMB
327,890). In accordance with the agreement, we made payments of $1,467,000
(RMB10,000,000) and $1,760,400 (RMB 12,000,000) in September 2008 and November
2008, respectively. On March 17, 2009, the Shandong Taibang and Huitian
successfully completed the registration process with the Administration of
Industry and Commerce in Xi&#146;An, Shannxi Province to transfer the 35% equity
title from Mr. Fan Qingchun to Shandong Taibang.
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The final installment payment of
approximately $3,373,119 (RMB 22,993,315), which includes the accrued interest
of approximately $145,719 (RMB 993,315), was due March 31, 2009. While the
Company is able and willing to make the final payment, the local tax authority
where Huitian is located prohibited the Company from making the final payment
due to the dispute over the Mr. Fan&#146;s personal income tax rate and the
withholding tax receiving jurisdiction. The Company is awaiting the final
decision from the local tax authority and expects the payment can be made during
April, 2009. </P>
</font>
<P align=justify>Since November 14, 2008, the date of second installment
payment, the Company has exercised its rights as a shareholder of Huitian,
pursuant to cooperation agreements among Taibang and the other Huitian
shareholders, including the right to re-elect directors to Huitian&#146;s board of
directors and board of supervisors and engagement of new executive officers. In
January 2009, Shandong Taibang received approximately $147,256 (RMB 1,003,789)
from Huitian for its share of 2008 dividends declared by Huitian according to
the equity transfer agreement. </P>
<P align=justify>Huitian is a manufacturer of plasma-based biopharmaceutical
products in Shaanxi Province and is one of only 32 such manufacturers in China
who are government approved. Shaanxi Province, which has a population of 37
million, has had a historically high collection volume with approximately ten
plasma collection stations in operation, collecting approximately 300 tons of
plasma supply each year. Only four of the collection stations in Shaanxi Province are government approved and three of these are owned
by Huitian. Huitian produces about 80 tons of plasma-based products per year and
has 200 tons of annual production capacity. Huitian believes that it currently
controls approximately 1.2% of the market for plasma-based biopharmaceutical
products in China, a factor which we believe provides strong long-term growth
potential. </P>

<P align=justify>Huitian is in compliance with GMP standards and it is also

<P align=justify><B>Principal Factors Affecting our Financial
Performance</B></P>
<P align=justify>The following are key factors that affect our financial
condition and results of operations and we believe them to be important to the
understanding of our business. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Raw Material Prices </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The primary raw material used in the production of our albumin
and immunoglobulin products is human plasma. These products are still not
affordable to many PRC patients. As China&#146;s economy grows, we expect more
Chinese people will become consumers of medical treatments and procedures,
including procedures requiring the use of human plasma. As a result, we expect
the enhanced economic conditions in China will result in increased demand for
human plasma. <B></B></P>
<P align=justify>Collection of human plasma in China is regulated and until
recently, only licensed Plasmapheresis stations owned and operated by the
government could collect human plasma. Each collection station can only supply
plasma to the one manufacturer that has signed the &#147;Quality Responsibility&#148;
statement with them. In Shandong Province, there are six plasma collection
stations and we had annual plasma supply contracts with three of them indicating
the estimated cost for each ton of plasma until December 2006. The price of
human plasma is negotiated on an annual basis and is determined by a number of
factors including, but not limited to, the cost of operating the collection
stations, the nutritional supplement fee awarded to the donors for each
donation, and the anticipated volume of total plasma donated. </P>
<P align=justify>In March 2006, the Ministry of Health promulgated certain
&#147;Measures on Reforming Plasma Collection Stations,&#148; or the Blood Collection
Measures, whereby the ownership and management of PRC plasma stations are
required to be transferred to plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies while the
regulatory supervision and administrative control remain with the government.
Plasma stations, that did not complete their reform by December 31, 2006, risked
revocation of their license to collect plasma. In December 2006, we signed
agreements to acquire certain assets of five of the six plasma stations in
Shandong, which we have since acquired. On January 1, 2007 we obtained the
permit to operate these stations. These acquisitions will allow us to have
direct influence on the operation of these collection stations in the future and
secure a stable source of plasma supply for production. </P>
<P align=justify>In January 2007, we entered into letters of intent to acquire
certain assets of three plasma stations in Guangxi Province, two of which we
acquired in February and April 2007 and obtained their permit to operate.
However, there can be no assurance that the acquisition of the remaining plasma
station can be completed or continue on the same terms that we have initially
agreed to in the letter of intent as the permit for this station is in dispute.
Please refer to &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; for more information regarding this dispute.
</P>
<P align=justify>Through Shandong Taibang, we formed separate subsidiaries that
acquired the assets of the five plasma stations in Shandong and two of the
plasma stations in Guangxi Province, and we will form a subsidiary to acquire
the assets of the remaining plasma station in Guangxi Province. The wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Shandong Taibang holding our new plasma stations are the Xia Jin
Plasma Company, the Qi He Plasma Company, the He Ze Plasma Company, the Huan
Jiang Plasma Company, the Yang Gu Plasma Company, the Zhang Qiu Plasma Company
and Pu Bei Plasma Company, which is still under construction. The other plasma
station is held in the Fang Cheng Plasma Company, which is 80% owned by Shandong
Taibang and 20% owned by Lin Feng, an unrelated third party. Our acquisition of
each plasma station was conditioned on the government&#146;s issuance to our
acquiring subsidiaries all permits necessary to operate the acquired assets which we have
now obtained. We have also made employment offers to all or substantially all of
the employees of each plasma station that we have acquired. </P>

<P align=justify>We do not expect any material differences in our cost structure
as a result of the acquisition of the plasma stations. However, we expect that
our plasma supply will increase due to improved management. Although we have
generally been able to pass substantially all cost increases in recent years on
to our customers, there is no assurance that we can continue to do that in the
future. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Prices of Our Products </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In recent years, due to market demand, we were able to increase
the selling price of most of our key products. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Demand for Our Products </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The demand for our products is largely affected by the general
economic conditions in China as our products are still not affordable to many
patients. As China&#146;s economy grows, we expect more Chinese people will become
consumers of medical treatments and procedures, including procedures requiring
human plasma. However, we expect that the current global economic slowdown and
the current credit crisis will result in slower economic growth in China and a
depressed economic environment which in turn may make our products less
affordable to more patients. In spite of the slowdown, we expect that in light
of the ongoing shortage for our products and the fact that there is no medical
alternative to our products in treating certain medical diseases, such
reductions and disruptions could have a less material adverse effect on our
business operations than it could have on the health care industry in
general.<B> </B></P>
<P align=justify>In addition, we are trying to mitigate any possible impact of
these conditions by expanding our product range and markets through the
introduction of new products required by customers. We believe that our
technical expertise is important in introducing products that are in demand.
</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Production Capacity</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Prior to the completion of our newly constructed facility with
700 metric tons annual production capacity in July 2008, our sales volume is
limited by our annual production capacity. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Competition</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We are subject to intense competition. There are both local and
overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale
of potential substitute or similar biopharmaceutical products as our products in
the PRC. These competitors may have more capital, better research and
development resources, manufacturing and marketing capability and experience
than us. In our industry, we compete based upon product quality, product cost,
ability to produce a diverse range of products and logistical capabilities. Our
profitability may be adversely affected if (i) competition intensifies; (ii)
competitors drastically reduce prices; or (iii) competitors develop new products
or product substitutes having comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic
effects which are more effective and /or less costly than those produced by us.
Please refer to &#147;Competition&#148; for more information regarding this factor. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Taxation</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify><I>United States</I> </P>
<P align=justify>We are subject to United States tax at a tax rate of 34%. No
provision for income taxes in the United States has been made as we have no
income taxable in the United States. </P>

<P align=justify>Our subsidiary, Logic Express Ltd., was incorporated in the BVI and under the current laws of
the BVI, is not subject to income taxes. </P>
<P align=justify><I>China</I> </P>
<P align=justify>Before the implementation of the New EIT Law, Foreign Invested
Enterprises, or FIEs, established in the PRC are generally subject to an
enterprise income tax, or EIT, rate of 33.0%, which includes a 30.0% state
income tax and a 3.0% local income tax. The New EIT Law imposes a unified EIT of
25.0% on all domestic-invested enterprises and FIEs, unless they qualify under
certain limited exceptions. Therefore, nearly all FIEs are subject to the new
tax rate alongside other domestic businesses rather than benefiting from the old
tax laws applicable to FIEs, and its associated preferential tax treatments,
beginning January 1, 2008. </P>
<P align=justify>Despite these pending changes, the New EIT Law gives the FIEs
established before March 16, 2007, or Old FIEs, such as our 82.76%  owned
subsidiary Shandong Taibang, a five-year grandfather period during which they
can continue to enjoy their existing preferential tax treatment. During this
five-year grandfather period, the Old FIEs which enjoyed tax rates lower than
25% under the original EIT law shall gradually increase their EIT rate by 2% per
year until the tax rate reaches 25%. In addition, the Old FIEs that are eligible
for the &#147;two-year exemption and three-year half reduction&#148; or &#147;five-year
exemption and five-year half-reduction&#148; under the original EIT law, are allowed
to remain to enjoy their preference until these holidays expire. The
discontinuation of any such special or preferential tax treatment or other
incentives would have an adverse effect on any organization's business, fiscal
condition and current operations in China. </P>
<P align=justify>In addition to the changes to the current tax structure, under
the New EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with &#147;de facto
management bodies&#148; within China is considered a resident enterprise and will
normally be subject to an EIT of 25.0% on its global income. The implementing
rules define the term &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; as &#147;an establishment that
exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the production,
business, personnel, accounting, etc., of a Chinese enterprise.&#148; If the PRC tax
authorities subsequently determine that the Company should be classified as a
resident enterprise, then our organization&#146;s global income will be subject to
PRC income tax of 25.0% . </P>
<P align=justify>As a sino-foreign joint venture company, Shandong Taibang has
been granted a preferential tax holiday by the Tax Bureau of the PRC as of 2003.
Accordingly, Shandong Taibang is entitled to tax concessions from 2003 whereby
the profit for the first two financial years beginning with the first
profit-making year is exempt from income tax in the PRC, and the profit for each
of the subsequent three financial years is taxed at 50% of the prevailing state
income tax rate. Local income tax of 3% is exempted for five years starting from
the first profit-making year. Shandong Taibang will be allowed the benefits of
tax holidays under the grandfather treatment over a five-year transition period,
and the applicable income rate will be 25% after the tax holiday. According to
the PRC&#146;s central government policy, new or high technology companies will enjoy
preferential tax treatment of 15%, instead of 25%. On February 12, 2009,
Shandong Taibang received the new technology or high technology certification
from Shandong provincial government. The Certification allows the Company to
receive the 15% preferential income tax rate, for a period of three years
starting from January 1, 2008. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2008 and
2007</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify><I>Revenues</I>.<I> </I>Our revenues are derived primarily from
the sales of human albumin and various types of immunoglobulin. Our revenues
increased 44.3%, or $14,352,491, to $46,751,160 for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2008, compared to revenues of $32,398,669 for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2007. The increase in revenues during fiscal year 2008 is primarily
attributable to a general increase in the price of plasma based products, which
was partially offset by a decrease in our sales volume except for one of our
products. Among the factors that contributed to the growth in revenue, foreign
exchange translation accounted for 12.5% of the increase. All of our approved
products, except human rabies immunoglobulin, recorded price increases ranging
from 29.7% to 227.7% . For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, the average
price for our approved human albumin products, which contributed 57.8% to our
total revenues, increased 29.7%, the average price for our approved human
immunoglobulin for intravenous injection, which contributed 22.0% to our
revenues, increased 102.8%, and the average price for our approved human tetanus
immunoglobulin, which contributed 3.2% to our revenue, increased 76.3%, as
compared to the same period in 2007. During fiscal year 2008, the SFDA
implemented the new 90-day quarantine period on plasma raw material effective
July 1, 2008. This new measure further tightens the raw material that is
available for production, and has adversely impacted the already short supply of
plasma-based products. As a result, volume in sales for our human albumin, human
hepatitis B immunoglobulin, human rabies immunoglobulin and human tetanus
immunoglobulin products decreased by 7.4%, 41.7%, 27.1% and 30.3%, respectively,
while the sales volume for approved our human immunoglobulin for intravenous use
increased by 39.2%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31 2008, as
compared to the same period in 2007. </P>
<P align=justify>Price increase of our products between 2007 and 2008 was
primarily attributable to the government&#146;s stringent control on the quality
standard of the plasma-based production industry, which resulted in a shortage
in the supply of finished products. We were able to adjust our production plan
to take advantage of the limited market supply of plasma resources to realize
higher profit margins. In addition, there is a shortage in the market supply for
human albumin products which has increased the value of our products in the
market place. According to the SFDA spokeswoman, Ms. Yan Jiang Ying in a
September 2007 press conference, there is a critical shortage in the market
supply of human albumin due to the shortage of plasma raw material. According to
Ms. Yan, the overall market supply of human albumin was 117, 127 and 48 metric
tons during 2005, 2006 and the first 8 months of 2007, respectively. Our sales
of human albumin products for 2005, 2006 and 2007 were 4.2, 6.0 and 5.9 metric
tons, respectively, which we believe, in light of the SFDA supply data,
represents a steady increase in our market share for the periods 2005, 2006 and
2007 from 3.6%, to 4.7% and to 8.2%, respectively. The plasma-based industry has
been immune from the impact of the on-going global financial crisis as the
demand for our products has out-paced supply. As a result, our selling price,
cost of revenue and operating expenses during the fiscal year 2008 were not
impacted by the global financial turmoil. </P>
<P align=justify><I>Cost of Revenues</I>.<I> </I>Our cost of sales increased
$4,094,681, or 41.2%, to $14,040,602 for the year ended December 31, 2008, from
$9,945,921 during the same period in 2007. This increase was mainly due to a
12.2% increase in foreign exchange translation, in addition to the actual 28.9%
increase in cost of revenues. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due
to the increase in cost of raw material. The raw material cost as a percentage
of total cost of revenues is 76% in 2008, as compared to the 73% in 2007.
<B></B>Cost of revenues as a percentage of sales was 30.0% for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 30.7% during the same period in 2007.
The decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of sales is primarily due to
the favorable selling price increase, as well as our management&#146;s ability to
maintain efficiencies in our production process.<B> </B> </P>

of sales revenue, total expenses decreased by 3.4% to 26.5% for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2008 from 29.9% for the same period in 2007. The increase was
primarily attributable to the 65.2% increase in our general and administrative
expenses during the 2008 period, which was offset by the 50.1% decrease in
selling expense. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Selling Expenses</U>. For the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, our selling expenses decreased to
$2,212,073, from $4,434,721 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, a
decrease of $2,222,648, or 50.1% . As a percentage of sales, our selling
expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by 9.0%, to 4.7%,
from 13.7% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. The substantial decrease
in selling expenses is the reflection of the normalization of the marketing
strategy that initiated on the third quarter last year. Specifically, we awarded
sales bonuses of $0.36 million to sales personnel for their outstanding
achievement in generating revenue in 2007. Moreover, we aggressively launched
marketing efforts by holding more conferences in conjunction with our
distributors in most major cities, at an additional cost of approximately $1.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2007. In connection with these marketing
efforts, our sales force also incurred additional expenses of approximately $0.3
million. With the marketing efforts in 2007, the Company was able to obtain a
higher sales with a substantial lower level of selling expenses in 2008. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>General and Administrative
Expenses</U>. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, our general and
administrative expenses increased to $7,684,493, from $4,651,434 for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2007, a $3,033,059, or 65.2% increase. General and
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 2.0% to 16.4% for
the fiscal year 2008 from 14.4% for the fiscal year 2007. The dollar and
percentage increase was mainly due to the increase of personnel cost of $0.9
million, increase of professional expenses related to the costs of being a
public reporting company of $0.2 million and write off of $0.9 million bad debt.
</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Research and Development

research and development expenses were $1,166,494 and $609,178, respectively, an
increase of $557,316 or 91.5% . As a percentage of revenues, our research and
development expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
2.5% and 1.9%, respectively. The dollar and percentage increase was primarily
due to the cost of research activities and the clinical trial on our new
products during the period. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><U>Non-cash Employee
Compensation.</U></I> Effective May 9, 2008, our board of directors adopted the
2008 Plan under which a total of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock may be
issued. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we granted an aggregate of
937,500 immediately vested options to purchase shares of our common stock to our
employees and consultants under the 2008 Plan and granted ten-year options to
purchase an additional 60,000 shares of common stock, with one-half scheduled to

period in 2007, primarily as a result of our adoption of the 2008 Plan and
grants to employees and consultants made thereunder. The $1,311,727 compensation
expense represents the 937,500 shares of options fully vested on June 1, 2008
and the amortization of the compensation expense of options to purchase 30,000

<P align=justify>With the bank credit facilities that are available to us and
other financing activities, we expect that cash on hand, funds generated from
our operations and funds generated from companies that we may acquire in the
future will be sufficient to satisfy our current and future commitments for at
least the next twelve months. We do not believe that we have any significant
short term liquidity problems. In addition, we have an approximately $5.8
million additional bank facility that we can draw down in the event that
unforeseen liquidity requirements arise. The company believes that it will be
able to secure the large majority of the financing required for the two above
mentioned acquisitions from domestic bank facilities and available cash
resources. </P>

<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt">On September 26, 2008, we agreed to acquire a 90% controlling interest in
  or Dalin for a purchase price of RMB 194,400,000 (approximately $28.4
  million). Dalin owns 54% of the equity interest in Qianfeng Biological
  Products Co., Ltd., or Qianfeng, one of the largest plasma-based
  biopharmaceutical companies in China, located in Guiyang, Guizhou Province.
  The Company has completed the financial and legal due diligence investigations
  and expects the transaction to close within a few months, subject to the
  formal transfer of title to the Company.
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt">On October 10, 2008, our indirect majority owned subsidiary, Shandong
  Taibang entered into an agreement to acquire 35% of the equity interest in or
  Huitian, a biopharmaceutical company based in Xi&#146;an, Shaanxi Province, from
  Mr. Fan Qingchun, a PRC citizen, for an aggregate purchase price of
  approximately $6,502,902 (RMB 44,327,890) including interest of $48,102 (RMB
  327,890). The Company has completed the financial and legal due diligence
  investigations and expects the transaction to close upon the final payment on
  March 31, 2009. On March 17, 2009, the Shandong Taibang successfully completed
  the registration process with Administration of Industry and Commerce in the
  City of Xi&#146;An, Shaanxi Province to transfer the 35% equity title from Mr. Fan
  Qingchun to Shandong Taibang according to the Equity Transfer Agreement.

<P align=justify><B>Critical Accounting Policies </B></P>
<P align=justify>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our
management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts
reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments
and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that
are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting
policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and
results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are most
important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results of operations
and require management's difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a
result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting
estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial
statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the
estimate may differ significantly from management's current judgments. We
believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant
estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements.

<P align=justify><B><I>Fair Value of Financial Instruments </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) 107,
&#147;Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments&#148; requires disclosure of
the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. SFAS 107 defines financial instruments. The Company considers the carrying
amount of cash, receivables, payables including accrued liabilities and short
term loans to approximate their fair values because of the short period of time
between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and
if applicable, their stated rates of interest are equivalent to interest rates
currently available.

<P align=justify>On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS 157, &#147;Fair Value
Measurements&#148;, which defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation
hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosures
requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follow:
</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt">Level 1: inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices
  (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

  <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt">Level 2: inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for
  similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are
  observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
  substantially the full term of the financial instruments.
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt">Level 3: inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and
  significant to the fair value. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify><B><I>Revenue recognition </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We recognizes revenue when products are delivered and the
customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant
receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the
sales price is fixed or determinable, which are generally considered to be met
upon delivery and acceptance of products at the customer site. Sales are
presented net of any discounts given to customers. As a policy, we do not accept
any product returns and based on our records, product returns, if any, are
immaterial. Sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of a
value-added tax (&#147;VAT&#148;). All products produced by us and sold in the PRC are
subject to a Chinese VAT at a rate of 6% of the gross sales price or at a rate
approved by the Chinese local government. Products distributed by Shandong
Medical are subjected to a 17% VAT. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Inventories</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>Due to its unique nature, our principal raw material, human
blood plasma is subject to various quality and safety control issues which
include, but are not limited to, contaminations and blood born diseases. In
addition, limitations of current technology pose biological hazards inherent in
plasma that have yet to be discovered, which could result in a widespread
epidemic due to blood infusion. In the event that human plasma is discovered to
contain pathogens or infectious agents or other bio-hazards, we would be
required to write down our inventory to net realizable value. We determine the
net realizable value of our inventories on the basis of anticipated sales
proceeds less estimated selling expenses. At each balance sheet date, we
evaluate inventories that may be worth less than current carrying amounts. No
provision for inventory write down was required for 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</P>
<P align=justify>Total inventories amounted to $14.9 million and $9.5 million as
of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In order to ensure that the growing
demand for our products is met, as well as the 90-day quarantine period
requirement on plasma raw material implemented by the PRC government, we have
been gradually increasing our inventory level of raw materials. We strictly
follow the production processes required by government regulations resulting in
the relatively high level of work-in-progress customary to our industry. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>We review periodically the carrying amounts of long-lived
assets including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets with
finite useful lives, to assess whether they are impaired. We evaluate these
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
their carrying amounts may not be recoverable such as a change of business plan,
technical obsolescence, or a period of continuous losses. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated
future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. In
determining estimates of future cash flows, significant judgment in terms of
projection of future cash flows and assumptions is required. There was no
impairment charges recognized for the  year ended December 31,  2007. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Use of Estimates</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
accordance with US GAAP requires us to make a number of estimates and
assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an
ongoing basis, we review our estimates and assumptions, including those related
to the recoverability of the carrying amount and the estimated useful lives of
long-lived assets, valuation allowances for accounts receivable and realizable
values for inventories. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised
estimates. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Contingencies</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>In the normal course of business, we are subject to
contingencies, including, legal proceedings and claims arising out of the
business that relate to a wide range of matters, including among others, product
liability. We recognize a liability for such contingency if we determine that it
is probable that a loss has occurred and a reasonable estimate of the loss can
be made. We may consider many factors in making these assessments, including
past history and the specifics of each matter. As we have not become aware of
any product liability claim since operations commenced, we have not recognized a
liability for any product liability claims. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</B> </P>
<P align=justify>In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, &#147;The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities&#151;including an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 115&#148; which permits companies to choose to measure many
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not
currently required to be measured at fair value. The objective of SFAS 159 is to
provide opportunities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by
measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply
hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and
disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies
that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
liabilities. The Company adopted SFAS 159 on January 1, 2008, and chose not to
elect the option to measure the fair value of eligible financial assets and
liabilities. </P>
<P align=justify>In June 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF
07-3, &#147;Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services
Received for use in Future Research and Development Activities&#148; (&#147;FSP EITF
07-3&#148;), which addresses whether nonrefundable advance payments for goods or
services that used or rendered for research and development activities should be
expensed when the advance payment is made or when the research and development
activity has been performed. The adoption of FSP EITF 07-3 did not impact the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements </P>
<P align=justify>In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, &#147;Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51&#148;, which establishes accounting and reporting standards
for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent,
the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent&#146;s ownership interest and the
valuation of retained non-controlling equity investments when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated. The Statement also establishes reporting requirements that
provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the
interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners. SFAS
160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company
believes adopting SFAS 160 will significantly impact its financial statements
for purchases of minority ownership completed after December 31, 2008. </P>

<P align=justify>In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141(R), &#147;Business
Combinations&#148; to replace SFAS 141, &#147;Business Combinations&#148;<I>. </I>SFAS 141R
retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS 141 that the acquisition method of
accounting (which SFAS 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business
combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination.
SFAS 141R requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition
date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions.
This replaces SFAS 141&#146;s cost-allocation process, which required the cost of an
acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values. SFAS 141R also requires the
acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages (sometimes referred to as
a step acquisition) to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as
well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of
their fair values (or other amounts determined in accordance with SFAS 141R).
SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting
period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it
before that date. The Company believes adopting SFAS 141R will significantly
impact its financial statements for all business combinations completed after
December 31, 2008. </P>
<P align=justify>In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161, &#147;Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities &#150; An Amendment of SFAS No. 133&#148;.
Effective on January 1, 2009, SFAS 161 seeks to improve financial reporting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures
regarding the impact on financial position, financial performance, and cash
flows. To achieve this increased transparency, SFAS 161 requires (1) the
disclosure of the fair value of derivative instruments and gains and losses in a
tabular format; (2) the disclosure of derivative features that are credit
risk-related; and (3) cross-referencing within the footnotes. The Company is in
the process of evaluating the new disclosure requirements under SFAS 161. </P>
<P align=justify>In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 162, "The Hierarchy of
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". SFAS 162 is intended to improve
financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy, for
selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements
that are presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP for nongovernmental entities.
SFAS 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC's approval of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, "The Meaning of Present
Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles." SFAS 162
has no impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition, operations or cash
flows.</P>
<P align=justify>In June 2008, the FASB issued EITF 07-5 &#147;Determining whether an
Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is indexed to an Entity&#146;s Own Stock&#148;. This
Issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
application is not permitted. Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133 &#147;Accounting for
Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#148; specifies that a contract that would
otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both (a) indexed to the
Company&#146;s own stock and (b) classified in stockholders&#146; equity in the statement
of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument.
EITF 07-5 provides a new two-step model to be applied in determining whether a
financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer&#146;s own stock
and thus able to qualify for the SFAS 133 paragraph 11(a) scope exception. This
standard triggers liability accounting on all options and warrants exercisable
at strike prices denominated in any currency other than the functional currency
of the operating entity in China (Renminbi). EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2008, and is expected to materially affect
the Company&#146;s financial statements to carry all warrants and options as
liabilities at fair value and to reflect the change in fair value as a gain
(loss). </P>
<P align=justify>In June 2008, FASB issued EITF 08-4, &#147;Transition Guidance for
Conforming Changes to Issue No. 98-5.&#148; The objective of EITF 08-4 is to provide
transition guidance for conforming changes made to EITF 98-5, &#147;Accounting for
Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently
Adjustable Conversion Ratios&#148;, that result from EITF 00-27 &#147;Application of Issue
No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments&#148;, and SFAS 150, &#147;Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and

<P align=justify>In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP EITF 99-20-1, &#147;Amendments

of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests
in Securitized Financial Assets&#148;. FSP EITF 99-20-1 changes the impairment model
included within EITF 99-20 to be more consistent with the impairment model of
SFAS 115. FSP EITF 99-20-1 achieves this by amending the impairment model in
EITF 99-20 to remove its exclusive reliance on &#147;market participant&#148; estimates of
future cash flows used in determining fair value. Changing the cash flows used
to analyze other-than-temporary impairment from the &#147;market participant&#148; view to
a holder&#146;s estimate of whether there has been a &#147;probable&#148; adverse change in
estimated cash flows allows companies to apply reasonable judgment in assessing
whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. The adoption of FSP
EITF 99-20-1 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial

      <P align=justify>Effective May 9, 2008, our board of directors adopted the

      appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock, restricted stock
      units and performance shares. A total of five million (5,000,000) shares
      of our common stock may be issued pursuant to the 2008 Plan. The exercise
      price per share for the shares to be issued pursuant to an exercise of a
      stock option will be no less than the fair market value per share on the
      grant date, except that, in the case of an incentive stock option granted
      to a person who holds more than 10% of the total combined voting power of
      all classes of our stock or any of our subsidiaries, the exercise price
      will be no less than 110% of the fair market value per share on the grant
      date. No more than an aggregate of 500,000 shares (or for awards
      denominated in cash, the fair market value of 5,000,000 shares on the
      grant date) may be subject to awards under the 2008 Plan to any individual
      participant in any one fiscal year. No awards may be granted under the

  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12">On May 9, 2008, we entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Stanley
  Wong, our former Chief Executive Officer until June 1, 2008, pursuant to which
  we agreed to pay Mr. Wong a monthly fee of RMB40,000 or its HK$ equivalent
  (approximately $5,725), as consideration for performance of his duties as
  consultant. We also agreed to grant Mr. Wong a ten-year non-qualified option
  under the 2008 Plan, for the purchase of 50,000 shares our common stock, at an
  exercise price of $4.00 per share. The term of the consulting agreement
  commenced on June 1, 2008, and expired on December 31, 2008, in accordance

<P align=justify style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12">During 2007, the Company advanced in total $413,697 (RMB
3,007,481) in cash to
a 20% minority shareholder of one of the Company&#146;s plasma companies for the
purchases of plasma collection license and certain equipments for its Fang Cheng
Plasma Company. However, the title transfer of those equipments, with the
estimated value of approximately $16,871 (RMB 122,481), has not been realized.
The Company determined that the likelihood of the minority shareholder&#146;s ability
to deliver the title of those equipments is minimal and made a provision for the
amount of $16,871 as of December 31, 2008. The Company also determined that the
future cash flows expected to be generated from the Fang Cheng plasma collection
license had impaired as the plasma collected in 2008 did not warrant any
carrying amount for the license. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment
write-down of intangible assets for approximately $415,873 (RMB 2,885,000). </P>

<P align=justify>In 2007, the Company also prepaid $516,456 to the same minority
shareholder of one of the plasma companies. The prepayment is for the purpose of
acquiring certain assets. Assets are expected to be received by January 2009.
However, as of December 31, 2008, the Company determined that the likelihood of
recovering these advances and prepayment is minimal, due to the minority

</B></P>
<P align=justify>To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of <BR>China
Biologic Products, Inc. </P>
<P align=justify>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
China Biologic Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December, 2008 and 2007,
and the related consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive
income, shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended December 31, 2008. China Biologic Products, Inc&#146;s
management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. </P>
<P align=justify>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P align=justify>In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
China Biologic Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
and the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. </P>

<U>Principal Activities and Reorganization</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
China Biologic Products, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;CBP&#148;) was originally incorporated in 1992 under the laws of the state of Texas as Shepherd Food Equipment, Inc. On July 18, 2006, the Company entered into a Share Exchange
Agreement with Logic Express Ltd (&#147;Logic Express&#148;) and its stockholders. Upon the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement on July 19, 2006, Logic Express became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. </P>
<P align="justify">
Logic Express was incorporated on January 6, 2006, in the British Virgin Islands. Logic Express was established for the purpose of acquiring an 82.76% majority equity interest in Shandong Missile Biological Products Co., Ltd., which it acquired on
April 17, 2006 and on February 27, 2007 changed its name to Shandong Taibang Biological Products Co., Ltd. (&#147;Shandong Taibang&#148;). As a result of the acquisition, Shandong Taibang became the Company&#146;s indirect subsidiary.</P>
<P align="justify">
The Company through its direct and indirect subsidiaries is principally engaged in the research, development, commercialization, manufacture and sale of human blood products to customers in the People&#146;s Republic of China (the &#147;PRC&#148;)
and India.</P>
<P align="justify">
<U>Acquisition of assets from plasma stations</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
In the third quarter of 2006, Shandong Taibang, through its wholly owned plasma companies, entered into an asset transfer agreement with the Shandong Provincial government to acquire certain assets of five plasma stations in Shandong Province, for
total consideration of approximately &#36;2,607,356 (RMB 19.3 million).  The operating licenses of the plasma companies were effective as of January 1, 2007. </P>
<P align="justify">
In January 2007, Shandong Taibang, through its 100% and 80% owned plasma companies, entered into letters of intent to acquire certain assets of two plasma stations in Guangxi Province for total consideration of approximately &#36;761,781
(approximately RMB 5.6 million). </P>
<P align="justify">
<U>Establishment of distribution company</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
In September 2006, Shandong Taibang applied to establish a wholly owned subsidiary &#147;Shandong Missile Medical Co., Ltd.&#148; (&#147;Shandong Medical&#148;). The registration of Shandong Medical was approved by the Shandong Provincial Department
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on July 19, 2007. Shandong Medical&#146;s scope of business is the wholesale of biological products with a business license period of 25 years from the date of registration, with a registered capital of
&#36;384,600.</P>
<P align="justify">
<U>Establishment of new collection station in Guangxi</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
In June 2008, the Company received the approval from the Guangxi Province Bureau of Health to set up a new plasma collection station in Pu Bei County, Guangxi Province. The new plasma collection station will be located in the Centralized Industry
Zone of Pu Bei County and when it becomes operational, it will replace CBP's existing Fang Cheng Plasma Collection Station (&#147;Fang Cheng&#148;). The Company's management decided to relocate Fang Cheng to a more strategic location to increase
collection volumes. During the construction period, the existing Fang Cheng Plasma Station will still continue with its normal operations. With the approval of the Centralized Industry Zone of Pu Bei County, once Fang Cheng becomes operational, the
Company hopes to expand its coverage area to secure higher collection volumes in the future. </P>

<P align="center">
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS <br>
DECEMBER 31, 2008 </P>
<P align="justify">
<B>Note 2 &#150; Summary of significant accounting policies</B></P>
<P align="justify">
<U>Principles of consolidation</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;). All material inter-company transactions and balances have been
eliminated in the consolidation.</P>
<P align="justify">
<U>Use of estimates</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. For example, management
estimates the fair value of stock based compensation as well as potential losses on outstanding receivables. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing its financial statements are reasonable and prudent. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. </P>
<P align="justify">
<U>Foreign currency translation</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
The reporting currency of the Company is the US dollar. The Company&#146;s principal operating subsidiaries established in the PRC use their local currency, Renminbi (&#147;RMB&#148;), as their functional currency.  Results of operations and cash
flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate as quoted by the People&#146;s Bank of China at the end of the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this
process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statements of stockholders&#146; equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred.</P>
<P align="justify">
In accordance with FAS 95, "Statement of Cash Flows," cash flows from the Company's operations is calculated based upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not
necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet. </P>
<P align="justify">
The consolidated balance sheet amounts, with the exception of equity at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were translated at RMB6.82 to &#36;1.00 and RMB7.29 to &#36;1.00, respectively.  The equity accounts were stated at their historical rate. The average
translation rates applied to consolidated statements of income and cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were RMB6.94 and RMB7.59, respectively. </P>
<P align="justify">
<U>Revenue recognition</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
The Company recognizes revenue when products are delivered and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or
determinable, which are generally considered to be met upon delivery and acceptance of products at the customer site. Sales are presented net of any discounts given to customers. As a policy, the Company does not accept any product returns and based
on our records, product returns, if any, are immaterial.  Sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of a value-added tax (&#147;VAT&#148;). All products produced by the Company and sold in the PRC are subject to a Chinese VAT at a
rate of 6% of the gross sales price or at a rate approved by the Chinese local government. Products distributed by Shandong Medical are subjected to a 17% VAT. </P>
<P align="justify">
<U>Shipping and handling</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
Shipping and handling costs related to costs of goods sold are included in selling, general and administrative costs and totaled &#36;60,164 and &#36;93,107 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. </P>
<P align="justify">
<U>Financial instruments</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) 107, &#147;Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments&#148; requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. SFAS 107 defines the fair value
of financial instruments. The Company considers the carrying amount of cash, receivables, payables including accrued liabilities and short term loans to approximate their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of
such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable, their stated rates of interest are equivalent to interest rates currently available. </P>

<P align=center>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<br>
DECEMBER 31, 2008
</P>
<P align=justify>On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS 157, &#147;Fair Value
Measurements&#148;, which defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation
hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosures
requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follow:
</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12">Level 1: inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices
  (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12">Level 2: inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for
  similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are
  observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
  substantially the full term of the financial instruments.
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12">Level 3: inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and
  significant to the fair value. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>The Company&#146;s investment in unconsolidated affiliate amounted
to $6,533,977 as of December 31, 2008. Since there is no quoted or observable
market price for the fair value of similar investment, the Company then used the
level 3 inputs for its valuation methodology. The determination of the fair
value was based on the capital investment that the Company contributed income or
losses from investment and additional contributions made and distributions
received. The carrying value of the investment in unconsolidated affiliate
approximated the fair value as of December 31, 2008.</P>
<P align=justify>The carrying value of the long term bank loan amounted to
$5,868,000. The Company used Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for
the long term bank loan by comparing the stated loan interest rate to the rate
charged by the Bank of China to similar loans. </P>

<P align=justify>The Company's operations are carried out in the PRC and are
subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically
associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. Accordingly, the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations may be
influenced by the political, economic and legal environments in the PRC, and by
the general state of the PRC economy. The Company's results may be adversely

<P align=justify>Cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts

financial institutions which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation insured limits for the banks located in the United States
or may exceed Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board insured limits for the banks
located in Hong Kong. Balances at financial institutions or state-owned banks
within the PRC are not covered by insurance. Total cash in state-owned banks at
December 31, 2008 and 2007 amounted to $8,689,414 and $4,814,991, respectively,
$47,865 and $240,797 of which are covered by insurance, respectively. The

<P align=justify>Construction in progress represents the costs incurred in
connection with the construction of buildings, new additions, or capitalized
interest incurred in connection with the Company&#146;s plant facilities. In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 34, &#147;Capitalize of Interest Cost&#148;,
interest incurred on borrowings is capitalized to the extent that borrowings do
not exceed construction in progress. The credit is a reduction of interest
expense. No depreciation is provided for construction in progress until such
time as the assets are completed and placed into service. Maintenance, repairs
and minor renewals are charged directly to expenses as incurred. Major additions
and betterment to property and equipment are capitalized. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of
long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS 144. When estimated cash flows
generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of the asset, the
Company recognizes an impairment loss. Based on its review, the Company believes
that, as of December 31, 2008, there were no impairments of its long-lived
assets. </P>

<P align=justify>Intangible assets of the Company are reviewed at least annually
or more often if circumstances dictate, to determine whether their carrying
value has become impaired. The Company considers assets to be impaired if the
carrying value exceeds the future projected cash flows from related operations.
The Company also re-evaluates the years of amortization to determine whether
subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives.
For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded an
impairment loss of $415,873 and $0, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the Company expects these assets to be fully

received non-refundable grants of &#36;139,365 and &#36;257,415, respectively, from the PRC municipal government.  Grants received from the PRC municipal government can be used for enterprise development and technology innovation purposes.  The

<U>Income taxes</U><BR>

<P align="justify">
The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS 109, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes&#148;, which requires the recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
income tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Provision for income taxes consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes. Since the Company had no operations within the United States there is no provision for US taxes
and there are no deferred tax amounts at December 31, 2008 and 2007. In July, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued FASB Interpretations No. 48, <I>Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#150; an interpretation
of FASB Statement No. 109</I> (&#147;FIN 48&#148;), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a return. FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, recognition, classification and disclosure of
tax positions, along with accounting for the related interest and penalties.  FIN 48 became effective at the beginning of 2007 and had no impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P align="justify">
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. </P>
<P align="justify">
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis
used in the computation of assessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probably that taxable profit will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. </P>
<P align="justify">
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or
charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. </P>

<P align="justify">
The Company accounts and reports stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&#148;, which defines a fair-value-based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and transactions in
which an entity issues its equity instruments to acquire goods and services from non-employees. Stock compensation for stock granted to non-employees has been determined in accordance with SFAS 123R and the EITF 96-18, "Accounting for Equity
Instruments that are issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services", as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measured. </P>
<P align="justify">
<U>Recently issued accounting pronouncements</U><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159, &#147;The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities&#151;including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115&#148; which permits companies to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. The objective of SFAS 159 is to provide opportunities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and
liabilities differently without having to apply hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for
similar types of assets and liabilities. The Company adopted SFAS 159 on January 1, 2008, and chose not to elect the option to measure the fair value of eligible financial assets and liabilities. </P>
<P align="justify">
In June 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 07-3, &#147;Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for use in Future Research and Development Activities&#148; (&#147;FSP EITF 07-3&#148;), which
addresses whether nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that used or rendered for research and development activities should be expensed when the advance payment is made or when the research and development activity has been
performed.  The adoption of FSP EITF 07-3 did not impact the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements </P>
<P align="justify">
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, &#147;Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51&#148;, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests
in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent&#146;s ownership interest and the valuation of retained non-controlling
equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. The Statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the
non-controlling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company believes adopting SFAS 160 will significantly impact its financial statements for purchases of minority ownership completed after December
31, 2008. </P>
<P align="justify">
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141(R), &#147;Business Combinations&#148; to replace SFAS 141, &#147;Business Combinations&#148;<I>. </I>SFAS 141R retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS 141 that the acquisition method of accounting
(which SFAS 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. SFAS 141R requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions. This replaces SFAS 141&#146;s cost-allocation process, which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated
to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. SFAS 141R also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages (sometimes referred to as a step acquisition) to recognize the
identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values (or other amounts determined in accordance with SFAS 141R). SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before that date. The Company believes adopting SFAS 141R will
significantly impact its financial statements for all business combinations completed after December 31, 2008. </P>
<P align="justify">
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161, &#147;Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities &#150;An Amendment of SFAS No. 133&#148;. Effective on January 1, 2009, SFAS 161 seeks to improve financial reporting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures regarding the impact on financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. To achieve this increased transparency, SFAS 161 requires (1) the disclosure of the fair value of
derivative instruments and gains and losses in a tabular format; (2) the disclosure of
derivative features that are credit risk-related; and (3) cross-referencing within the footnotes. The Company is in the process of evaluating the new disclosure requirements under SFAS 161. </P>

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles". SFAS 162 is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be
used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP for nongovernmental entities. SFAS 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC's approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section
411, "The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles." SFAS 162 has no impact on the Company&#146;s financial condition, operations or cash flows. </P>
<P align="justify">
In June 2008, the FASB issued EITF 07-5 &#147;Determining whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is indexed to an Entity&#146;s Own Stock&#148;. This Issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is not permitted. Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133 &#147;Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities&#148; specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition
of a derivative but is both (a) indexed to the Company&#146;s own stock and (b) classified in stockholders&#146; equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument. EITF 07-5 provides a new
two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer&#146;s own stock and thus able to qualify for the SFAS 133 paragraph 11(a) scope exception. This standard triggers liability
accounting on all options and warrants exercisable at strike prices denominated in any currency other than the functional currency of the operating entity in China (Renminbi). EITF 07-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008, and is expected to materially affect the Company&#146;s financial statements to carry all warrants and options as liabilities at fair value and to reflect the change in fair value as a gain (loss). </P>
<P align="justify">
In June 2008, FASB issued EITF 08-4, &#147;Transition Guidance for Conforming Changes to Issue No. 98-5.&#148; The objective of EITF 08-4 is to provide transition guidance for conforming changes made to EITF 98-5, &#147;Accounting for Convertible
Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios&#148;, that result from EITF 00-27 &#147;Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments&#148;, and SFAS 150, &#147;Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity&#148;. This Issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Early application is permitted. EITF 08-4 had no impact on the
Company.</P>
<P align="justify">
On October 10, 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-3, &#147;Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active,&#148; which clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides an
example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP 157-3 became effective on October 10, 2008, and its adoption did not have a material impact on
our financial position or results for the years ended December 31, 2008.<I> </I></P>
<P align="justify">
In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP EITF 99-20-1, &#147;Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20, and EITF 99-20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized
Financial Assets&#148;. FSP EITF 99-20-1 changes the impairment model included within EITF 99-20 to be more consistent with the impairment model of SFAS 115. FSP EITF 99-20-1 achieves this by amending the impairment model in EITF 99-20 to remove its
exclusive reliance on &#147;market participant&#148; estimates of future cash flows used in determining fair value. Changing the cash flows used to analyze other-than-temporary impairment from the &#147;market participant&#148; view to a
holder&#146;s estimate of whether there has been a &#147;probable&#148; adverse change in estimated cash flows allows companies to apply reasonable judgment in assessing whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred. The adoption of FSP
EITF 99-20-1 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because all of our investments in debt securities are classified as trading securities </P>

<P align=justify>(1) During 2007, the Company advanced in total $413,697 (RMB
3,007,481) in cash
to a 20% minority shareholder of one of the Company's plasma companies for the purchases of plasma collection license
and certain equipments for its Fang Cheng Plasma Company. However, the title
transfer of those equipments, with the estimated value of approximately $16,871
(RMB 122,481), has not been realized. The Company determined that the likelihood
of the minority shareholder&#146;s ability to deliver the title of those equipments
is minimal and made a provision for the amount of $16,871 as of December 31,
2008. The Company also determined that the future cash flows expected to be
generated from the Fang Cheng plasma collection license had impaired as the
plasma collected in 2008 did not warrant any carrying amount for the license. As
a result, the Company recorded an impairment write-down of intangible assets for
approximately $415,873 (RMB 2,885,000).</P>
<P align=justify>(2) The Company prepaid approximately $516,456 (RMB 3,767,000)
to a minority shareholder of one of the plasma companies as of December 31,
2008. The prepayment is for the purpose of acquiring certain assets. Assets are
expected to be received by January 2009. The Company determined that the
likelihood of recovering this prepayment is minimal, due to the minority
shareholder&#146;s ability to secure the title of the assets and the personal
financial difficulty as a result of the economic downturn, and made a provision
for the amount as allowance for bad debt as of December 31, 2008. The Company is
currently negotiating with the shareholder in attempt to recover the fund. </P>
<P align=justify>(3) As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company borrowed an
aggregate of $773,277 and $722,674, respectively, from its minority shareholder,
Shandong Institute, for working capital purposes. The Company is required to
repay the loan in cash due by August 2009, with an annual interest rate of
6%.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Note 4 &#150; Prepayments and deferred expense</B><BR></P>
<P align=justify>Prepayments and deferred expense represent partial payments for
deposits on raw material purchases and prepayment for insurance expenses and
amounted to $614,704 and $138,756 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. </P>
<P align=justify>Long term prepayments represent partial payments or deposits on
plant and equipment and intangible assets purchases and amounted to $955,874 and
$711,459 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. </P>

<P align=justify>On October 10, 2008, Shandong Taibang entered into an Equity
Transfer Agreement (the "Equity Transfer Agreement") with Mr. Fan Qingchun (the
"Transferor"), a PRC citizen holding 35% of the equity interest in Xi'an Huitian
Blood Products Co., Ltd. ("Huitian"), a PRC limited liability company. Pursuant
to the Equity Transfer Agreement, the Transferor agrees to sell to Shandong
Taibang, and Shandong Taibang agrees to purchase from the Transferor, 35% equity
interest in Huitian for an aggregate purchase price of $6,502,902 (or RMB
44,327,890) including interest of $48,102 (RMB 327,890). Huitian is one of the
32 government approved plasma-based product producers in China, and it is in
compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (&#147;GMP&#148;) standards. It is also
approved by the PRC&#146;s State Food and Drug Administration (&#147;SFDA&#148;) to produce
four types of plasma-based products. As December 31, 2008, the Company has paid
a total of $3,171,300 with the unpaid balance of $3,275,501 to be due by March
31, 2009, including interest. <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">While the
Company is able and willing to make the final payment, the local tax authority
where Huitian is located prohibited the Company from making the final payment
due to the dispute over the Mr. Fan&#146;s personal income tax rate and the
withholding tax receiving jurisdiction. The Company is awaiting the final
decision from the local tax authority and expects the payment can be made during
April, 2009. </P>
</font>
<P align=justify>Logic Express has also entered into an investment entrustment
agreement (the "Investment Agreement") with the minority shareholder in Shandong
Taibang, Shandong Biological Products Research Institute ("Biological
Institute"), pursuant to which Logic Express agrees to provide the investment
amount for the acquisition and the Shandong Institute agree to entrust Shandong
Taibang to acquire the 35% equity interest of Huitian in its name. In exchange
Logic Express is also obligated to pay Shandong Taibang approximately $18,000
(or RMB120,000) per year as consideration for Shandong Taibang's performance under
this agreement. Under the Investment Agreement, after the acquisition, Logic
Express will be in charge of Huitian's daily operation and management, will bear
the costs, expenses, liabilities and losses incurred in its operation, and will
enjoy its profits. Shandong Taibang will perform relevant tasks according to
Logic Express's instruction, and will not exercise any management right over
Huitian or derive any financial return from Huitian. Logic Express agreed to
indemnify Shandong Taibang for any loss in connection with the investment and
pledged its equity interest in Shandong Taibang as collateral against such
losses.<B> </B>

<P align=justify>The Company is governed by the Income Tax Law of the People&#146;s
Republic of China (PRC) concerning Foreign Investment Enterprises and Foreign
Enterprises and various local income tax laws (the Income Tax Laws). Under the
Income Tax Laws, foreign investment enterprises (FIE) generally are subject to
an income tax at an effective rate of 33% (30% state income taxes plus 3% local
income taxes) on income as reported in their statutory financial statements
after appropriate tax adjustments unless the enterprise is located in specially
designated regions of cities for which more favorable effective tax rates apply.
Upon approval by the PRC tax authorities, FIEs scheduled to operate for a period
of 10 years or more and engaged in manufacturing and production may be exempt
from income taxes for two years, commencing with their first profitable year of
operations, after taking into account any losses brought forward from prior
years, and thereafter with a 50% exemption for the next three years. </P>
<P align=justify>In 2002, the Company became a Sino-foreign joint venture. In
2003, the Company was granted by the state government for benefit of income tax
exemption in first 2 years from January 2003 to December 2004 and 50% exemption
for the third to fifth years from January 2005 to December 2007. </P>

<P align=justify>The Company&#146;s subsidiary, Shandong Taibang, was established
before March 16, 2007 and therefore is qualified to continue enjoying the
reduced tax rate as described above.</P>
<P align=justify>Starting from January 1, 2008, Shandong Taibang became subject
to 25% income tax rate according to the newly issued Income Tax Laws of PRC.
According to PRC&#146;s central government policy, certain new technology or high
technology companies will enjoy preferential tax treatment of 15%, instead of
25%. On February 12, 2009, Shandong Taibang received the new technology or high
technology certification from Shandong provincial government. The Certification
allows the Company to receive the 15% preferential income tax rate, for a period
of three years starting from January 1, 2008. </P>

<P align=justify>The local government granted the Company tax exemption for
purchases of locally manufactured equipment for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2003 through 2007. Starting January 1, 2008 the government no longer
provides this tax exemption for purchases of locally manufactured equipment.
During the third quarter of 2008, the Company received a tax rebate for the
amount of $319,095 (RMB 2,181,102) for the Company&#146;s reinvestment of its
dividends back into Shandong Taibang at the end of our fiscal year 2007.
Starting January 1, 2008, all dividends paid to foreign parents are subject to a
10% income tax. As a result, the company recorded a $1,228,775 income tax
expense for dividends Shandong Taibang paid to its foreign parent, Logic
Express. </P>
<P align=justify>The following table reconciles the U.S. statutory rates to the

<P align=justify>(1) The 8.1% represents the $1,228,775 income tax expense for
dividends Shandong Taibang paid to its foreign parent in 2008 and expenses
incurred by CBP and Logic Express that are not deductible in PRC for the year
ended December 31, 2008 offset by tax rebate of $319,095 received during the
third quarter of 2008. The 1.9% represents expenses incurred by CBP and Logic
Express that are not deductible in PRC for the year ended December 31, 2007.

<P align=justify>The estimated tax savings due to the tax exemption for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 and 2007 amounted to $2,443,657 and
$2,498,472, respectively. The net effect on earnings per share if the income tax
had been applied would decrease basic earnings per share for the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007 by $0.11 and $0.12, respectively, would decrease the
diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 by
$0.11 and $0.11, respectively. </P>
<P align=justify>CBP was incorporated in the United States and has incurred net
operating losses of $1,777,854 (estimated) and $614,982 for income tax
purposes for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
estimated net operating loss carry forwards for United States income taxes
amounted to $3,661,143 which may be available to reduce future years&#146; taxable
income. These carry forwards will expire, if not utilize, from 2026 through
2028. Management believes that the realization of the benefits from these losses
appears uncertain due to the Company&#146;s limited operating history and continuing
losses for United States income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company has
provided a 100% valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset benefit to reduce
the asset to zero. Management reviews this valuation allowance periodically and
makes adjustments as warranted. The following table represents the rollforward
of the deferred tax valuation allowance </P>

<I>Transfer of Equity Interests</I><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
Mr. Zu Ying Du was one of the original equity holders in our operating subsidiary, Shandong Taibang. Pursuant to a joint venture agreement, among the original equity holders, Mr. Du was obligated to make a capital contribution of RMB20 million (or
approximately &#36;2.6 million) for a 25% interest in Shandong Taibang.  Mr. Du made this contribution using funds borrowed from the Beijing Chen Da Technology Investment Company, or Beijing Chen Da. Mr. Du failed to repay Beijing Chen Da for his
loan of the capital contribution amount.<SUP> </SUP>Mr. Du disputes that the money was due and owing. A Beijing court found that Beijing Chen Da had given money to Mr. Du but found that the loan agreement failed to comply with Chinese law. A notice
was issued on July 5, 2004 by the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau Economic Crime Investigation Unit requesting a stay of the Beijing action pending their investigation into money laundering relating to the 20 million RMB loan to Zu Ying Du. </P>
<P align="justify">
On September 26, 2004, Beijing Chen Da entered into an equity transfer agreement with Mr. Du, pursuant to which Mr. Du&#146;s 25% equity interest in Shandong Taibang was transferred to Beijing Chen Da as repayment of the RMB20 million debts. This
agreement was signed by Mr. Du&#146;s brother who held a power of attorney from Mr. Du. This transfer was approved by the Shandong Provincial Department of Foreign of Trade and Economic Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC on March 17, 2005. Mr. Du
disputes the legitimacy of this transfer and has argued that his brother, Du Hai Shan, exceeded the scope of the power of attorney. Mr. Du sued his brother in the court of Jianli County, Hubei province, relating to the propriety of the
brother&#146;s actions under the power of attorney. Initially the county court found in its judgment that the power of attorney was valid, but that the transfer agreements signed by Mr. Du&#146;s brother, Du Hai Shan were invalid because their
execution and delivery were beyond the scope of Du Hai Shan&#146;s authority under the power of attorney.  Subsequently the Intermediate Court of Jingzhou City, Hubei province, ruled on December 10, 2008 to suspend the judgment based on the grounds
that the original court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The case is stated to be reviewed again by the Hubei Jingzhou Intermediate Court. </P>
<P align="justify">
Missile Engineering, another original equity holder wholly controlled by Mr. Du, was obligated to contribute RMB32.8 million (or &#36;4.2 million) for a 41% interest in Shandong Taibang by means of cash, equipment and patent technology. It was
obligated to obtain a new drug certificate and production license of its patent technology from the government within a stipulated period in order to be recognized as a valid capital contribution, or in the alternative, make a cash payment. The
patent technology was valued as RMB26.4 million (or approximately &#36;3.4 million). However, Missile Engineering failed to obtain the new drug certificate and production license within the stipulated period.  Mr. Du also disputes whether the period
for obtaining the certificate and license had expired. Pursuant to a stockholders resolution on September 26, 2004, Missile Engineering agreed to sell its 41% interest in Shandong Taibang to Up-Wing and Up-Wing agreed to take up the obligation of
Missile Engineering to pay the RMB26.4 million in cash.  This transfer was approved by Shandong COFTEC on March 17, 2005.  Missile Engineering disputes this transaction and sued Mr. Du&#146;s brother in the court of Jianli County, Hubei province,
relating to the propriety of the brother&#146;s actions under the power of attorney. Initially the county court found in its judgment that the act had exceeded the scope of the power of attorney. Subsequently the Intermediate Court of Jingzhou City,
Hubei province, ruled on December 10, 2008 to suspend the judgment based on the grounds that the original court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The case is stated to be reviewed again by the Hubei Jingzhou Intermediate Court.</P>
<P align="justify">
In June 10, 2005, Beijing Chen Da also sold its equity interest in Shandong Taibang to Up-Wing Investments Limited, or Up-Wing, pursuant to a share transfer agreement, which became effective on September 2, 2005, upon approval by the Shandong
Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC. In March 2006, Up-Wing sold its equity interests in Shandong Taibang to Logic Express, our subsidiary.</P>
<P align="justify">
In 2006, Missile Engineering applied for arbitration before the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, or CIETAC, to challenge the effectiveness of the transfer to Up-Wing Investments Limited, of the equity interests in
Shandong Taibang, formerly owned by Missile Engineering.  The equity transfer had been approved by the Shandong Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC.  Missile Engineering later voluntarily withdrew
this application and instead applied for administrative reconsideration of the equity transfer, but this application was rejected by the Ministry of Commerce in 2007. Missile Engineering applied with the District Court of Lixia District, Jinan City,
Shandong province requesting revocation of Shandong COFTEC&#146;s approval of the equity transfer to Up-wing by Missile Engineering. Missile Engineering later voluntarily withdraw the action. In April 2007, Logic Express initiated an arbitration
proceeding
before the Shandong Taian Arbitration Committee, to establish that Logic Express is the lawful shareholder of Shandong Taibang.  The parties to that proceeding were Logic Express Ltd. and Shandong Taibang Biological Products Co., Ltd. The
Arbitration Committee&#146;s decision on September 6, 2007 confirmed that Logic Express had legitimate ownership as a result of the transfers of Shandong Taibang. Up-Wing started an action in the Intermediate Court of Taian City, Shandong province
requesting the court to establish that Up-wing is the lawful shareholder of Shandong Taibang. The intermediate court rejected the application by Up-Wing on the basis that the same matter had been tried by the arbitration panel.</P>

On February 16, 2009, Mr. Du and Missile Engineering have filed actions in the Intermediate Court of Wuhan City, Hubei province, against the following defendants, Du Hai Shan the brother of Mr. Du, Beijing Chen Da and Logic Express. Mr. Du and
Missile Engineering have requested that the Wuhan Intermediate Court to restore the equity interests originally held by the plaintiffs, 25% equity interest by Mr. Du and 41% equity interest by Missile Engineering. On February 17, the Wuhan
Intermediate Court has issued preliminary orders attaching 66% of the equity of Shandong Taibang pending the outcome of the case. </P>

<I>Bobai County Collection Station</I><BR>
</P>
<P align="justify">
In January 2007, the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiary, Shandong Taibang, advanced &#36;413,697 (RMB3.0 million) to Feng Lin, the 20% minority shareholder in Fang Cheng Plasma Company, the Company&#146;s majority owned subsidiary, for the purpose of
establishing or acquiring a plasma collection station. Mr. Lin and Shandong Taibang intended to establish the Bobai Kangan Plasma Collection Co., Ltd. (&#147;Bobai&#148;) in Bobai County, Guangxi and on January 18, 2007, Shandong Taibang signed a
letter of intent to acquire the assets of the Bobai Plasma Collection Station, which was co-owned by Mr. Lin and Mr. Keliang Huang. However, in January 2007, Hua Lan Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. (&#147;Hua Lan&#148;) filed suit in the District
Court of Hong Qi District, Xin Xiang City, Henan Province, alleging that Feng Lin, Keliang Huang and Shandong Taibang established and/or sought to operate the Bobai Plasma Collection Station using a permit for collecting and supplying human plasma
in Bobai County, that was originally granted to Hua Lan by the government of the Guangxi region, without Hua Lan&#146;s permission. The establishment and registration of Bobai was never realized as a result of this law suit. On January 29, 2007, on
Hua Lan&#146;s motion, the District Court entered an order to freeze funds in the amount of approximately &#36;386,100 (RMB3,000,000) held by the defendants in the case, including approximately &#36;65,750 (RMB500,000) in funds held in Shandong
Taibang&#146;s bank account in Taian City. A hearing was held on June 25, 2007 and judgment was entered against the defendants along with a &#36;226,780 (RMB1,700,000) joint financial judgment.  The Company appealed the District Court judgment to
the Henan Province High Court. In November 2007, the High Court affirmed the judgment against the three defendants and increased the amount of the joint financial judgment to approximately &#36;405,954 (RMB3,000,000).</P>
<P align="justify">
In January 2008, Hua Lan enforced the judgment granted by the High Court to freeze the Company&#146;s bank accounts. Shandong Taibang has filed a separate action against Hua Lan before the Taian City District Court to seek recovery of any losses in
connection with Hua Lan&#146;s claim and to request that the Taian City District Court preserve Hua Lan's property or freeze up to approximately &#36;411,300 (RMB 3 million) of Hua Lan&#146;s assets to secure the return of such funds to the Company.
The intermediate court in Taian City accepted the application on February 14, 2008 but the matter is still pending.  Pending the outcome of the proceedings, Shandong Taibang increased its loss contingency reserve during its fourth quarter of 2007
from approximately &#36;75,593 (RMB566,667) to &#36;133,400 (RMB1,000,000) to cover its share of the enforcement of this judgment. During the fourth quarter of 2008, full amount of the judgment, including Feng Lin and Keliang Huang&#146;s portions
of the judgment and the related fees, approximately &#36;456,222 (RMB 3,109,900) has been withdrawn from Shandong Taibang&#146;s account. The Company recorded Feng Lin and Keliang Huang&#146;s portion of the judgment, approximately &#36;304,143
(RMB2,073,234), as receivable as a result of the withdraw. As of December 31, 2008, the Company determined that it is unlikely that the Company will be able to recover such receivable from those two individuals and wrote off the receivable as bad
debt expense.</P>
<P align="justify">
In light of the foregoing, it is unlikely that the Company&#146;s planned acquisition of the assets of Bobai will go forward. </P>

<P align=justify>On May 9, 2008, the Company adopted the 2008 Equity Incentive
Plan, which provides up to 5,000,000 shares of Company&#146;s Common Stock to be made
available to employees and directors at various prices as established by the
Board of Directors of the Company. On May 9, 2008, the Company granted options
to purchase an aggregate of 937,500 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock under
the 2008 Plan to certain directors and employees, pursuant to stock option
agreements between the Company and each of these directors or employees. The
options have an exercise price of $4.00 per share, will vest immediately vest
and will expire on June 1, 2018. On July 24, 2008, the Company granted options
to purchase an aggregate of 60,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock under
the 2008 plan to its three independent directors. These options have an exercise
price of $4.00 per share and 30,000 shares will be vested on January 24, 2009
and the remaining 30,000 shares will be vested on July 24, 2009, with the
expiration date of July 24, 2018. As of December 31, 2008, there were 4,002,500
shares available under the plan. </P>
<P align=justify>The fair value of each option granted on May 9, 2008 and July

<P align=justify>The volatility of the Company&#146;s common stock was estimated by
management based on the historical volatility of the Company&#146;s common stock, the
risk free interest rate was based on Treasury Constant Maturity Rates published
by the U.S. Federal Reserve for periods applicable to the estimated life of the
options, and the expected dividend yield was based on our current and expected
dividend policy. The value of the options was based on the Company&#146;s common
stock price on the date the options were granted. Because the Company does not
have a history of employee stock options, the Company utilized the simplified
method to estimate the life of the options which is the same as assuming that
the options are exercised at the mid-point between the vesting date and
expiration date. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company expensed
$1,311,727 in compensation expense. As of December 31, 2008, approximately
$62,281 of estimated expense with respect to non-vested stock-based awards has
yet to be recognized and will be recognized as an expense over the employee&#146;s
remaining weighted average service period of approximately 0.67 years. The
options are accounted for as equity under SFAS 133 and EITF 00-19.The options
activity is as follows: </P>

<P align=justify><B>Note 11 &#150; Statutory reserves</B><BR></P>
<P align=justify>In accordance with the &#147;Law of the PRC on Joint Ventures Using
Chinese and Foreign Investment&#148; and the Company&#146;s Articles of Association,
appropriations from net profit should be made to the Reserve Fund and the
Enterprise Expansion Fund, after offsetting accumulated losses from prior years,
and before profit distributions to the investors. The percentages to be
appropriated to the Reserve Fund and the Enterprise Expansion Fund are
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Reserve fund</U><BR></P>
<P align=justify>For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
transferred $2,036,732 and $1,156,748, respectively, to the surplus reserve
fund. Amounts represent 10% of the net income determined in accordance with PRC
accounting rules and regulations, and are transferred to a statutory surplus
reserve fund until such reserve balance reaches 50% of the Company&#146;s registered
capital. As of December 31, 2008, amount of $3,806,825 still needs to be
transferred to statutory reserve. The transfer to this reserve must be made
before distribution of any dividend to shareholders. The surplus reserve fund is
non-distributable other than during liquidation and can be used to fund previous
years&#146; losses, if any, and may be utilized for business expansion or converted
into share capital by issuing new shares to existing stockholders in proportion
to their shareholding or by increasing the par value of the shares currently
held by them, provided that the remaining reserve balance after such issue is
not less than 25% of the registered capital.</P>
<P align=justify><U>Enterprise expansion fund</U><BR></P>
<P align=justify>The enterprise fund may be used to acquire fixed assets or to
increase the working capital to expend on production and operation of the
business. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
transferred $1,018,366 and $578,375, respectively, to the fund. Amounts
represent 5% of the net income determined in accordance with PRC accounting
rules and regulations. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Note 12 &#150; Retirement benefit plans</B><BR></P>
<P align=justify>Regulations in the PRC require the Company to contribute to a
defined contribution retirement plan for the benefit of all permanent employees.
All permanent employees are entitled to an annual pension equal to their basic
salaries at retirement. The PRC government is responsible for the benefit
liability to these retired employees. The Company is required to make
contributions to the state retirement plan at 20% of the monthly base salaries
of the current employees. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
Company made pension contributions in the amount of $220,493 and $171,802,
respectively. </P>

<P align=justify><B>Note 14 &#150; Subsequent event </B></P>
<P align=justify>On September 26, 2008, Logic Express Limited (&#147;Logic Express&#148;),
a wholly-owned BVI subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Equity Transfer
Agreement with Fan Shaowen, Chen Aimin, Chen Aiguo and Yang Gang for the
purchase of a total of a 90% equity interest in Chongqing Dalin Biologic
Technologies Co., Ltd., (&#147;Chongqing Dalin&#148;), a PRC limited liabilities company,
for a price of $28,518,480 (RMB 194,400,000). The Company made prepayments of
approximately $2,023,165 (RMB 13,810,000) and approximately $12,208,296
(RMB83,390,000) on this potential acquisition in October and December 2008,
respectively. An English translation of the Equity Transfer Agreement is
incorporated by reference to exhibit 10.1 of the Company&#146;s Form 8-K filed with
SEC on October 2, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has completed the
financial and legal due
diligence investigations on Dalin and Qianfeng and expects to close the transaction within a few months, subject to the formal transfer of title to the Company. In January 2009, Logic Express appointed three out of the four Board of Directors
members to the Chongqing Dalin to take control of Dalin.  On January 16, 2009, the shareholders of Qianfeng Biological Products (&#147;Qianfeng&#148;), which Chongqing Dalin owns 54% equity interest, elected four Board of Directors appointed by
Chongqing Dalin as part of its seven board members. On January 17, 2009, the Board of Directors of Qianfeng elected a new management team consists of all Logic Express and Chongqing Dalin&#146;s appointees, including CEO, Executive Senior Vice
President, CFO and Directors of sales. As a result, the Company took over the control of Qianfeng starting January 16, 2009. </P>
<p align="justify">As part of its due diligence investigation into Dalin and Qianfeng, the
Company discovered that the indirect interest in Qianfeng that would be acquired
under Equity Transfer Agreement will be diluted. The local AIC records show
Dalin as a 54% shareholder of Qianfeng. However, Qianfeng issued equity to
certain investors pursuant to a capital increase agreement, dated May 2007.
Qianfeng received the consideration for the equity, but the increase in
registered capital and issuance of the equity interest has not yet been
registered with AIC. A shareholder of Qianfeng brought a lawsuit claiming that
such shareholder&#146;s right of first refusal with respect to the new equity
issuance was violated. When the capital increase is registered with AIC, Dalin
will own about 43.3% in Qianfeng. The lawsuit brought by the Qianfeng
shareholder was decided against such shareholder, who subsequently appealed.
Therefore, Dalin&#146;s interests in Qianfeng could be diluted to as low as 41.3% as
the result of the issuance of additional equity to the shareholder, if his
appeal prevails. Even if the indirect equity interest that the Company acquires
through the proposed acquisition is diluted down to 41.3%, the Company would be
able to retain control over Qianfeng as a result of the four board membership to
the Qianfeng&#146;s board. The Company does not expect this dispute to impact its
ability to complete the acquisition.</p>
