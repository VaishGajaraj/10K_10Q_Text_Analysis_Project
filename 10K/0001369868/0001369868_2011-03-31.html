<P align=justify><B>PART I</B></P>
<P align=justify><B>ITEM 1. BUSINESS.</B></P>
<P align=justify><B>Overview of Our Business</B></P>
<P align=justify>We are a biopharmaceutical company and through our indirect PRC
subsidiaries, Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang, and our minority-owned PRC
investee, Huitian, we are principally engaged in the research, development,
manufacturing and sales of plasma-based pharmaceutical products in China.
Shandong Taibang operates from our manufacturing facility located in Tai&#146;an,
Shandong Province, and Guizhou Taibang operates from our manufacturing facility
located in Guiyang City, Guizhou Province. Our minority owned investee, Huitian,
operates from its facility in Shaanxi Province. The plasma-based
biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China is highly regulated by both
the provincial and central governments. Accordingly, the manufacturing process
of our products is strictly monitored from the initial collection of plasma from
human donors to finished products. Our principal products include our approved
human albumin and immunoglobulin products. </P>
<P align=justify>We are approved to sell human albumin 20%/10ml, 20%/25ml and
20%/50ml, 10%/10ml, 10%/25ml, 10%/50ml and 25%/50ml. Human albumin is our
top-selling product. Sales of these human albumin products represented
approximately 48.0%, 49.7% and 57.8% of our total revenues, respectively, for
the each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Human albumin is
principally used to increase blood volume while immunoglobulin, one of our other
major products, is used for certain disease preventions and cures. The Company&#146;s
approved human albumin and immunoglobulin products use human plasma as raw
material. Albumin has been used for almost 50 years to treat critically ill
patients by replacing lost fluid and maintaining adequate blood volume and
pressure. All of our products are prescription medicines administered in the
form of injections. </P>
<P align=justify>We sell our products to customers in the PRC, mainly hospitals
and inoculation centers. Our sales have historically been made on the basis of
short-term arrangements and our largest customers have changed over the years.
For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, our top 5 customers
accounted for approximately 12.3%, 10.7% and 16.2%, respectively, of our total
revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, our largest
customer accounted for approximately 2.8%, 4.0% and 6.4%, of our revenue,
respectively. As we continue to diversify our geographic presence, customer base
and product mix, we expect that our largest customers will continue to change
from year to year. We have product liability insurance covering all of our
products. However, since our establishment in 2002, there has not been any
product liability claims nor has any legal action been filed against the Company
brought by patients related to the use of our products.</P>
<P align=justify>Our principal executive offices are located at No. 14 East
Hushan Road, Tai&#146;an City, Shandong, the People&#146;s Republic of China 271000. Our
corporate telephone number is (86) 538-620-2306 and our fax number is
(86)538-620-3895. We maintain a website at <U>http://www.chinabiologic.com
</U>that contains information about our operating company, but that information
is not part of this report.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Our History and Background</B></P>
<P align=justify>China Biologic Products, Inc. was originally incorporated on
December 20, 1989 under the laws of the State of Texas, as Shepherd Food
Equipment, Inc. On November 20, 2000, Shepherd Food Equipment, Inc. changed its
corporate name to Shepherd Food Equipment, Inc. Acquisition Corp., which is the
survivor of a May 28, 2003 merger with GRC Holdings, Inc. or GRC. In the merger,
the Company adopted the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of GRC and changed
its corporate name to GRC Holdings, Inc. On January 10, 2007, a Plan of
Conversion became effective pursuant to which GRC was converted into a Delaware
corporation and changed its name to China Biologic Products, Inc. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Acquisition of Logic Express</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>On July 19, 2006, we completed a reverse acquisition with Logic
Express, whereby we issued to the shareholders of Logic Express 18,484,715
shares of our common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of Logic Express and its majority-owned Chinese
operating subsidiary, Shandong Taibang. As a result of the reverse acquisition,
Logic Express became our 100% owned subsidiary, the former shareholders of Logic
Express became our controlling stockholders with 96.1% of our common stock, and
Shandong Taibang became our 82.76% majority-owned indirect subsidiary. Shandong
Taibang is a sino-foreign joint venture company established on October 23, 2002
with a registered capital of RMB 80 million (then approximately $10.3 million).
</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Acquisition of Plasma Stations</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In December 2006, our subsidiary, Shandong Taibang, acquired
all the assets of five plasma stations in Shandong Province. We obtained the
permit to operate the stations in January 2007. In April 2007, Shandong Taibang
acquired certain assets of two plasma stations in Guangxi Province. The two
plasma stations obtained their operating permits in February and April 2007,
respectively. </P>

<P align=justify>We acquired the assets of these plasma stations through
separate Shandong Taibang subsidiaries, specially formed for this purpose. The
subsidiaries holding six of our new plasma stations are the Xia Jin Plasma
Company, the Qi He Plasma Company, the He Ze Plasma Company, the Huan Jiang
Plasma Company, the Liao Cheng Plasma Company, and the Zhang Qiu Plasma Company.
The seventh plasma station is held by the Fang Cheng Plasma Company, which at
the time was 80% owned by Shandong Taibang and 20% owned by Feng Lin, an
unrelated third party. On January 13, 2010, Shandong Taibang acquired the 20%
non-controlling interest in the Fang Cheng Plasma Company, and it is now
wholly-owned by Shandong Taibang. In January 2007, Shandong Taibang also signed
a letter of intent to acquire certain assets of a plasma station in Guangxi
Province, however, we have not consummated this acquisition as the permit for
this station is in dispute, as described in Item 3, &#147;Legal Proceedings.&#148;</P>
<P align=justify>In June 2008, we received approval from the Guangxi Province
Bureau of Health to set up a new plasma collection station in Pu Bei County,
Guangxi Province. The new plasma collection station will be located in the
Centralized Industry Zone of Pu Bei County and when it becomes operational, it
will replace our existing Fang Cheng Plasma Collection Station. We decided to
relocate the Fang Cheng Plasma Collection Station to a more strategic location,
also in Guangxi, to increase collection volumes. </P>
<P align=justify>On January 22, 2010, Shandong Taibang entered into an equity
transfer agreement with Yuncheng Ziguang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (&#147;Yuncheng
Ziguang&#148;), located in Yuncheng, Shandong Province. Under the terms of the equity
transfer agreement, Shandong Taibang agreed to purchase 100% of Yuncheng
Ziguang&#146;s equity interest at a purchase price of RMB 10,066,672 (approximately
$1,476,781), which was paid on February 24, 2010. The purpose of this
acquisition is for relocation of Shandong Taibang&#146;s He Ze Plasma Company into
the nearby Yuncheng Ziguang facility. In February 2011, the He Ze Plasma Company
moved into the Yuncheng Ziguang facility and began collecting plasma. Currently
Yuncheng Ziguang has no other operations.</P>
<P align=justify>On July 7, 2010, Shandong Taibang invested RMB 6,000,000

Plasma Company, in Shandong Province. The Ning Yang Plasma Company was still
under construction as of December 31, 2010.</P>
<P align=justify>On July 20, 2010, Shandong Taibang invested another RMB
6,000,000 (approximately $910,200) to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary,
Yishui Plasma Company, in Shandong Province. The Yi Shui Plasma Company obtained
its operating permits from relevant PRC authorities on December 6, 2010, and had

<P align=justify><B><I>Establishment of Taibang Medical</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In September 2006, Shandong Taibang established a wholly owned
subsidiary, Taibang Medical (known then as Shandong Missile Medical Co., Ltd.),
with registered capital of $384,600, fully paid on March 1, 2007. On February 7,
2007, Taibang Medical obtained a distribution license for biological products,
except for vaccine, from the Shandong Food and Drug Administration, for a
license period of five years from the date of obtaining the license. The
registration of Taibang Medical was ultimately approved by Shandong Provincial
Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on July 4, 2007 and Taibang
Medical was registered on July 19, 2007. The scope of business is wholesale of
biological products, except vaccines, with a license period of 25 years from the
date of registration.</P>
<P align=justify>On August 14, 2009, we changed Taibang Medical&#146;s name from
Shandong Missile Medical Co., Ltd. to Shandong Taibang Medical Company. In
addition, the registered capital of Taibang Medical was increased by RMB
2,000,000 (approximately $293,400) to $733,500.</P>
<P align=justify>On July 8, 2010, Logic China, our PRC operating subsidiary,
entered into an equity transfer agreement to purchase 100% of the equity
interest in Taibang Medical from Shandong Taibang with a cash purchase price of
RMB 6,440,000 (approximately $947,327). The equity transfer was registered with
the local Administration for Industry and Commerce, or the AIC, on September 10,
2010 and the purchase price was fully paid on September 23, 2010. With this
equity transfer, Taibang Medical is now the Company&#146;s indirect wholly-owned

<P align=justify>On January 4, 2011, we entered into an equity transfer
agreement with Shaowen Fan to acquire the remaining 10% minority interest in
Dalin for a purchase price of RMB 50,000,000 (approximately $7,585,000). The
equity transfer was registered with the local AIC on January 26, 2011 and the
purchase price was fully paid as of February 22, 2011 in accordance with the
equity transfer agreement. With this equity transfer, Guiyang Dalin is now the
Company&#146;s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary.</P>
<P align=justify>On April 6, 2009, Logic Express entered into an agreement with
Shandong Institute, the noncontrolling interest holders in Shandong Taibang,
pursuant to which, Shandong Institute would provide an advance to assist Logic
Express&#146;s purchase of 90% Dalin's equity interests. Under the terms of the
agreement, Shandong Institute agreed to provide advance of $3,792,500
(RMB25,000,000), representing 12.86% of the Company&#146;s purchase consideration in
Dalin to the Company for one year, bearing interest equal to the higher of a
proportionate share of the net income of Dalin during the year ended December
31, 2009 or 6% per annum. On April 12, 2010, the Company fully paid the advance
from Shandong Institute and the interest of approximately $1.3 million, which
was less than the Company&#146;s previous estimate by approximately $0.9 million. The
Company recorded the difference between the previous estimate and actual payment
in other income of the consolidated statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2010. </P>
<P align=justify>As part of our due diligence investigation into Dalin and
Guizhou Taibang, we discovered that our indirect interest in Guizhou Taibang
acquired under the equity transfer agreement may be diluted to as low as 41.3%.
The local AIC records show Dalin as a 54% shareholder of Guizhou Taibang;
however, the AIC records do not reflect a potential issuance of Guizhou
Taibang&#146;s equity interests to certain investors in May 2007, pursuant to a
capital increase agreement. Guizhou Taibang has received the consideration for
the potential issuance of equity interests, but the increase in registered
capital and the related issuance of the equity interest has not yet been
registered with the local AIC, pending the outcome of a minority shareholder
suit against Guizhou Taibang and its then shareholders, alleging violation of
the shareholder&#146;s right of first refusal in connection with the May 2007 equity
issuance. For details regarding the Guizhou Taibang shareholder suit and our
position with respect to the May 2007 equity issuance of Guizhou Taibang&#146;s
equity interests, see our disclosure under Item 3, &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148; herein.
</P>
<P align=justify>Guizhou Taibang is one of the largest plasma-based
biopharmaceutical companies in China and is the only manufacturer currently
operating in Guizhou Province. With a population of 39 million, Guizhou Province
has historically produced the highest volumes of plasma collection in China,
because a higher proportion of its population has been willing to engage in the
collection process. Guizhou Province has a total of 19 plasma collection
stations in operation, collecting approximately 1,200 tons of plasma supply
every year. Guizhou Taibang owns seven of these plasma collection stations, of
which five are currently in operation and collecting approximately 300 tons of
plasma supply per year, with an annual capacity of 400 tons. We intend to employ
more advanced collection techniques at these stations to improve yields and
generate additional plasma supply. Guizhou Taibang is in compliance with Good
Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, standards, and has been approved by the PRC&#146;s
State Food and Drug Administration, or SFDA, to produce six types of
plasma-based products including Human Albumin, Human Immunoglobulin, Human
Intravenous Immunoglobulin, Human Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin, Human Tetanus
Immunoglobulin and Human Rabies Immune Globulin.</P>
<P align=justify>On December 30, 2010, the Guiyang AIC approved Guizhou
Taibang&#146;s application to change its name to Guizhou Taibang Biological Products
Co., Ltd. We expect that the name change will facilitate the Company&#146;s promotion
of the &#147;Taibang&#148; brand name and further the Company&#146;s integration of its
marketing efforts.</P>
<P align=justify>On November 11, 2010, the Company established Guiyang Qianfeng
Biological Technology Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Guizhou Taibang,
in Guiyang, Guizhou, for the purpose of research and development of placenta
based products.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Huitian Acquisition</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We purchased a 35% equity interest in Huitian at a purchase
price of RMB 44,000,000 (approximately $6,454,800) in October 2008. Huitian is a
manufacturer of plasma-based biopharmaceutical products in Shaanxi Province and
is one of only 32 such manufacturers in China which are government approved.
Shaanxi Province, which has a population of 37 million, has had a historically
high collection volume with approximately ten plasma collection stations in
operation, collecting approximately 300 tons of plasma supply each year. Only
four of the collection stations in Shaanxi Province are government approved and
three of these are owned by Huitian. Huitian produces about 80 tons of
plasma-based products per year and has 200 tons of annual production capacity.
We believe Huitian provides a strong long-term growth potential. Huitian is in
compliance with GMP standards and it is also approved by the SFDA for the
production of Human Albumin, Human Immunoglobulin, Human Immunoglobulin for
Intravenous Injection, and Human Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin products. </P>

<P align=justify><B>Our Industry</B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Plasma Collection in China</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The collection of human plasma in China is generally influenced
by a number of factors such as government regulations, geographical locations of
collection stations, sanitary conditions of collection stations, living
standards of the donors, and cultural and religious beliefs. Until 2006, only
licensed Plasmapheresis stations owned and operated by the government could
collect human plasma. Furthermore, each collection station was only allowed to
supply plasma to the one manufacturer that had signed the &#147;Quality
Responsibility&#148; statement with them. However, in March 2006, the Ministry of
Health promulgated certain &#147;Measures on Reforming Plasma Collection Stations,&#148;
or the Blood Collection Measures, whereby the ownership and management of PRC
plasma stations are required to be transferred to plasma-based biopharmaceutical
companies and the local government is charged with regulatory supervision and
administrative control in accordance with the policies of the central
government. Plasma stations that did not complete their reform by December 31,
2006 risked revocation of their license to collect plasma. </P>
<P align=justify>The supply of plasma for plasma-based products in the PRC has
been on the decline since 2003 from the historical high of annual supply of
approximately 7,000 tons to approximately 4,000 tons. We believe that this
decline is a direct result of the government&#146;s industry reforms of the country&#146;s
collection practices which led to the closure of many stations that did not meet
the new industry standards. Based on reports promulgated by the PRC Ministry of
Health, we estimate that the current annual supply of plasma in China amounts to
approximately 4,000 tons, as compared to 30,000 tons in the global market, with
the six largest manufacturers of plasma products accounting for approximately
50% of the annual plasma collection. In spite of the shortage of plasma supply,
revenues from the sale of plasma products in China amounted to approximately
$1.1 billion in 2009 per management&#146;s estimate, and revenues from the sale of
human albumin products accounted for about 70%. We expect that the plasma
derivatives market to grow at a 15% rate per year through 2011. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that these regulatory changes, including measures
which limit illegal selling of blood, have improved the quality of blood and
plasma by increasing cleanliness standards at blood collection stations. As the
operation of the plasma stations become more regulated and the donor population
expands, we believe that the overall quality of raw materials, such as human
albumin will continue to improve, leading to a safer, more reliable finished
product.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Plasma-Based Products Industry in China</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We produce approved human albumin and immunoglobulin products,
with human plasma as the main ingredient. In addition to the low usage ratio of
such products in China as compared to other more developed countries, there is a
significant difference in the make up and range of the plasma-based
pharmaceutical products. Based on our analysis, in most developed countries like
the United States, clotting factor products accounts for the majority of the
plasma-based biopharmaceutical products, while in China, human albumin products
accounts for the vast majority of such products. Specifically, total clotting
factor products and human albumin products, account for approximately 40% and
25%, respectively, of United States&#146; total annual plasma-derived products, and
account for approximately 3% and 59%, respectively, of China&#146;s. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Our Growth Strategy</B></P>
<P align=justify>Our mission is to become a first-class biopharmaceutical
enterprise in China. To achieve this objective, we have implemented the
following strategies:</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI><B><I>Securing the supply of plasma</I></B>. Due to the shortage of plasma
  and the reform of the ownership of plasma stations, our immediate strategy is
  to negotiate and acquire plasma stations in order to secure our plasma supply.
  In December 2006, we acquired five of the plasma stations in Shandong
  Province. Furthermore, in January 2007, we acquired two additional plasma
  stations in Guangxi Province. In June 2008, we received approval from the
  Guangxi Province Bureau of Health to set up a new plasma collection station in
  Pu Bei County, Guangxi Province, which, when operational, will replace our
  existing Fang Cheng Plasma Collection Station. We decided to relocate the Fang
  Cheng Plasma Collection Station to a more strategic location to increase
  collection volumes. During the construction period, the station will still
  continue with its normal operations. With the approval of the Centralized
  Industry Zone of Pu Bei County, once the Fang Cheng Plasma Collection Station
  becomes operational, we hope to expand its coverage area to secure higher
  collection volumes in the future. In January, 2010, Shandong Taibang purchased
  100% of Yuncheng Ziguang Biotechnology Co., Ltd., or Yuncheng Ziguang, located
  in Yuncheng, Shandong Province, for the purpose of relocation of Shandong
  Taibang&#146;s He Ze Plasma Company, or He Ze, into the nearby Yuncheng Ziguang
  facility. In February 2011, the He Ze Plasma Company moved into Yuncheng
  Ziguang and began collecting plasma. We hope to expand He Ze to secure higher
  collection volumes in the future. In 2010, we additionally established two new
  plasma companies in Shandong Province, one of which began operation in
  December 2010 and the other of which is still under construction. We also
  expect that our acquisition of Dalin and its PRC operating subsidiary, Guizhou
  Taibang, and our acquisition of a minority equity interest in Huitian, will
  help secure our plasma supply as well as expand production capacity and market
  coverage. </LI></UL>

<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <P><B><I>Acquisition of competitors and/or other biologic related

  part of our expansion strategy. Although there are about 32 approved
  plasma-based biopharmaceutical manufacturers in the market, we believe that
  there are only 26 manufacturers in operation, only about half of whom will be
  competitive. The top six manufacturers in China account for more than 50%
  market share. Furthermore, we believe that the regulatory authorities are
  considering further reforming the industry and those smaller, less competitive
  manufacturers will face the possibility of having their manufacturing permits
  revoked by the regulators, making them potential targets for acquisition.

<P align=justify>We have two product liability insurances covering Shandong
Taibang and Guizhou Taibang&#146;s products in the amount of approximately $3,034,000
(RMB 20,000,000) each. Since our establishment in 2002, there has not been any
product liability claims nor has any legal action been filed against us by
patients related to the use of our products. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Raw Materials </B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Plasma</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Plasma is the principal raw material for our biopharmaceutical
products. Until 2006, all plasma collection stations were owned by the PRC
government. Following the mandated privatization of plasma stations resulted
from the Ministry of Health&#146;s Blood Collection Measures, we acquired our stable
of plasma collection stations. We believe that the acquisitions of plasma
stations will give us a controlled source of plasma and better control over the
quality and quantity produced. We will also be able to have increased control
over the cost of plasma. Finally, we believe that we will enjoy benefits of
economies of scale with respect to the administration and management expenses of
our several plasma stations. </P>
<P align=justify>We spent $51.0 million, $35.6 million and $14.0 million on the
collection of plasma in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Currently, we own six
operating plasma collection stations in Shandong province, two in Guangxi
province and five in Guizhou province, and two under construction in each of
Shandong and Guangxi provinces. We currently maintain sufficient plasma supply
for approximately 6 months of production. In March 2007, the SFDA implemented
new measures on biopharmaceutical industry effective as of July 1, 2008,
requiring plasma raw material to be kept for at least 90 days before being put
into production. In view of the new measures, in due course we will extend our
plasma supply for approximately four months. We have not experienced any
interruptions to our production due to shortage of plasma.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Other Raw Materials and Packaging Materials</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Other raw materials used in the production of our
biopharmaceutical products include: reagents, consumables and packaging
materials. The principal packaging materials we use include glass bottles for
our injection products, external packaging and printed instructions for our
biopharmaceutical products. We acquire our raw materials and packaging materials
from our approved suppliers in China and overseas. We select our suppliers based
on quality, consistency, price and delivery of the raw materials which they
supply. </P>
<P align=justify>We have not experienced any shortage of supply on these raw
materials and packaging materials and there has not been any significant problem
with the quality of materials supplied by these suppliers. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Our Major Suppliers</B></P>
<P align=justify>The table below lists our major suppliers as of December 31,
2010, showing the cumulative dollar amount of raw materials and supplies
purchased from them during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and the
percentage of purchases from each supplier as compared to procurement of all raw
materials. </P>

<P align=justify>Because all of our products are prescription drugs, we can only
sell to hospitals and inoculation centers directly or through approved
distributors. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, direct sales
to distributors represented approximately 48.9%, 67.3% and 65.6%, respectively,
of our revenues. Our five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for
approximately 12.3%, 10.7% and 16.2% of our total revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our largest customer accounted

<P align=justify>As part of our effort to ensure the quality of our
distributors, we conduct due diligence to verify whether potential distributors
have obtained necessary permits and licenses and facilities (such as cold
storage) for the distribution of our biopharmaceutical products. We also assess
the distributors&#146; financial condition before appointing them as distributors.
Certain of our regional distributors are appointed on an exclusive basis within
a specified area. The supply contracts normally set out the quantity and price
of products. For distributors, they also contain guidelines for the sale and
distribution of our products, including restrictions on the geographical area to
which the products could be sold. We provide our distributors with training in
relation to our products and on sales techniques. We have implemented a coding
system for our products for easy tracking. Depending on the relationship and the
creditability of the distributors, we generally grant a credit period of no
longer than 30 days to distributors with some exceptions. For hospitals and
clinics, we generally grant a credit period of no longer than 90 days. We had a
bad debt credit of $0.1 million for 2010, a bad debt expense of $0.3 million for
2009 and a bad debt credit of $0.1 million for 2008 related to the sales of our
products. The $0.1 million bad debt credit for both 2010 and 2008 is due to
recovery of bad debt previously reserved. </P>

approximately 22.0%, 25.5% and 48.1% of our total revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Prior to the acquisition of
Dalin and Huitian, our strategy has been to focus our marketing efforts in
Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan and the northeastern part of China. With the advantage
of the scale of economy, the Company has been expanding its sales efforts into
30 provinces and municipal cities, especially those provinces that were untapped
by Shandong Taibang previously, with Shandong and Guangdong provinces accounting
for more than 30.8% of the total sales during 2010. </P>
<P align=justify>Our marketing and after-sales services department currently
employs approximately 93 employees. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that due to the unique nature of our products, the
key emphasis on our marketing efforts centers on product safety, brand
recognition, timely availability and pricing. As all of our products are
prescription medicines, we are not allowed to advertise our products in the mass
media. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total sales and

<P align=justify><B>Our Research and Development Efforts </B></P>
<P align=justify>The Shandong Institute was established in 1971. The Shandong
Institute is the research arm established by and directly administrated by the
Shandong Provincial health department. It was the only entity approved for the
research, development and production of biological and plasma-based
biopharmaceutical products in Shandong Province, the second largest province in
China. Since 1998, it promoted GMP management in the production process of blood
products and became one of the first blood products manufacturing enterprises to
obtain GMP Certification in China. In 2002, the Shandong Institute transferred
all of its business and the licenses necessary to carry on its business and
seconded certain of its employees to our subsidiary, Shandong Taibang. We were
awarded the advanced high-tech enterprise certification by the Department of
Science and Technology of Shandong Province in 2005 and 2008 and by the Ministry
of Science and Technology of China in 2006. In 2007, we were admitted as a
member of the Shandong Institute of Medicine and awarded the &#147;Advanced
Enterprise&#148; accolade by the Shandong Blood Center. We were also awarded the
&#147;Advanced Technology Certification for Foreign Funded Enterprises&#148; by the
Department of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation of Shandong Province in
2008. </P>
<P align=justify>We employ a market driven approach to initiate research and
development projects including both product and production technique
development. We believe that the key to the industry revolves around (i) safety
of products and (ii) maximizing the yield per unit volume of plasma. Our
research and development efforts are focused around the following areas: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>broaden the breadth and depth of our portfolio of plasma-based

<P align=justify>* These stages refer to the stages in the regulatory approval
process for our products disclosed under the heading &#147;Regulation&#148; in this
report. </P>
<P align=justify>For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001, 2009 and 2008,
total research and development expenses amounted to approximately $2.3 million,
$1.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, representing approximately 1.7%,
1.4% and 2.5%, respectively, of our revenues. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Our Competition</B></P>
<P align=justify>We are subject to intense competition. There are both local and
overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale
of potential substitute or similar biopharmaceutical products as our products in
the PRC. These competitors may have more capital, better research and
development resources, manufacturing and marketing capability and experience
than we do. In our industry, we compete based upon product quality, product
cost, ability to produce a diverse range of products and logistical
capabilities. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that we have strengthened our position in the
marketplace with our acquisition of Dalin and its 54% majority-owned operating
subsidiary, Guizhou Taibang and a 35% equity interest in Huitian, Xi&#146;an-based
biopharmaceutical company. </P>
<P align=justify>Our profitability may be adversely affected if (i) competition
intensifies; (ii) competitors drastically reduce prices; (iii) PRC government&#146;s
interference on prices; or (iv) competitors develop new products or product
substitutes having comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects
which are more effective and /or less costly than those produced by us. </P>
<P align=justify>Other approved biopharmaceutical manufacturers in the PRC are
entitled to produce many of the products produced by us. There are currently
about 32 approved manufacturers of plasma-based pharmaceutical products in
China. Many of these manufacturers are essentially producing the same type of
products that we produce: human albumin and various types of immunoglobulin.
However, due to recent Ministry of Health regulations, we believe that it is
difficult for new manufacturers to enter into the industry. We believe that our
major competitors in the albumin and immunoglobulin market in China are Hua Lan
Biological Engineering, Shanghai Institute of Biological Products, Shanghai RAAS
Blood Products Co. Ltd., Beijing Tiantan Biological Products, and Sichuan Yuanda
Shuyang Pharmaceutical Co. </P>
<P align=justify>In addition, competition from imported products and China&#146;s
admission as a member of the WTO creates increased competition. The PRC became a
member of the WTO in December 2001. Competition in the biopharmaceutical
industry in the PRC will intensify generally in two respects. With lower import
tariffs, we anticipate that imported biopharmaceutical products manufactured
overseas may become increasingly competitive with domestically produced products
in terms of pricing. We also believe that well-established foreign
biopharmaceutical manufacturers may set up production facilities in the PRC and
compete with domestic manufacturers directly. With the expected increased supply
of competitively priced biopharmaceutical products in the PRC, we may face with
increased competition from foreign biopharmaceutical products, including the
types of products manufactured by US manufacturers and other manufacturers. In
2009 and 2010, we have seen a substantial increase in the volume of imported
human albumin in China. If the trend of importation of human albumin continues,
we may face more fierce competition in domestic human albumin market.</P>
<P align=justify>We believe that we have secured better ranking in 2010 based on
our analysis of data regarding the approval for sales of plasma-derived products
published by China National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and
Biological Products throughout of the year. Our past financial performance is
attributable to our market position in the industry. Furthermore, while each of
the plasma products related companies have their own product composition which
include 3 main categories namely human albumin, human immunoglobulin and
lyophilized human factor, we are currently developing lyophilized human factor
products which we expect to launch in 2011. We will continue to meet challenges

<P align=justify><B>Regulation </B></P>
<P align=justify>This section summarizes the major PRC regulations relating to
our business. </P>
<P align=justify>Due to the nature of our products, we are supervised by various
levels of the PRC Ministry of Health and/or SFDA. Such supervision includes the
safety standards regulating our source supplies (mainly plasma), our
manufacturing process through the issuance of our GMP Certification and the
inspection of our finished products. </P>
<P align=justify>We are also subject other PRC regulations, including those
relating to taxation, foreign currency exchange and dividend distributions. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Plasma Collection</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Substantially all plasma donations for commercialized
plasma-based biopharmaceutical products are done through plasmapheresis donation
stations. Plasmapheresis donation means donors give only selected blood
components &#151; platelets, plasma, red cells, infection-fighting white cells called
granulocytes, or a combination of these, depending on donors blood type and the
needs of the community. Plasmapheresis stations in China are commonly used to
collect plasma. In China, current regulations only allow an individual donor to
donate blood in 14-day intervals, with a maximum quantity of 580ml (or about 600
gram) per donation. </P>
<P align=justify>The following are the regulatory requirements to establish a
plasmapheresis station in China: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>meet the overall plan in terms of the total number, distribution, and
  operational scale of plasmapheresis stations;
  <LI>have the required professional health care technicians to operate a
  station;
  <LI>have the facility and a hygienic environment to operate a station;
  <LI>have an identification system to identify donors;
  <LI>have the equipment to operate a station; and
  <LI>have the equipment and quality control technicians to ensure the quality
  of the plasma collected. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>As a result of the overhaul by the four ministries of the State
Council in May 2004, we estimate that the number of collection stations
(including plasma stations) that meet the standards imposed by the PRC has been
reduced from approximately 156 to approximately 120. Plasma stations were
customarily owned and managed by the PRC health authorities. In March 2006, the
Ministry of Health promulgated the Blood Collection Measures whereby the
ownership and management of the plasma stations must be transferred to
plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies while the regulatory supervision and
administrative control remain with the government. For those plasma stations
which did not complete their reform by December 31, 2006, their license to
collect plasma will be revoked. As a result, all plasma stations are now having
direct supply relationship with their parent fractionation facilities. </P>
<P align=justify>Set out below are some of the safety features at China&#146;s
collection stations: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <P>Collection stations can only source plasma from donors within the assigned
  district approved by the provincial health authorities. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Collection stations must perform a health check on the donor. Once the
  donor passes the health check, a &#147;donor permit&#148; is issued to the donor. The
  standards of the health check are established by the health authorities at the
  State Council level. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The design and printing of the &#147;donor permit&#148; is administrated by the
  provincial health authorities, autonomous region or municipality government,
  as the case maybe. The &#147;donor permit&#148; cannot be altered, copied or assigned.
  </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Before donors can donate plasma, the station must verify their identities
  and the validity of their &#147;donor permits.&#148; The donors must pass the
  verification procedures before they are given a health check and blood test.
  For those donors who have passed the verification, health check and blood test
  and whose plasma were donated according to prescribed procedures, the station
  will setup a record. </P></LI></UL>

<P align=justify><B><I>Production of Plasma-based Products</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The manufacture and sale of plasma-based biopharmaceutical
products is strictly regulated by the PRC government. For example, under PRC
law, each variation in the packaging, dosage and concentration of medical
products requires registration and approval by the SFDA. During this process the
altered product is not commercially available for sale. For example, among our
human albumin products only Human Albumin 20%/10ml, 20%/25ml, 20%/50ml,
10%/10ml, 10%/25ml, 10%/50ml, and 25%/50ml products are currently approved and

<P align=justify><B><I>Taxation</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>On March 16, 2007, the National People's Congress of China
passed a new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007,
the State Council of China passed its implementing rules, which took effect on
January 1, 2008. Before the implementation of the EIT Law, foreign invested
enterprises, or FIEs, established in the PRC, unless granted preferential tax
treatments by the PRC government, were generally subject to an earned income
tax, or EIT, rate of 33.0%, which included a 30.0% state income tax and a 3.0%
local income tax. The EIT Law and its implementing rules impose a unified EIT of
25.0% on all domestic-invested enterprises and FIEs, unless they qualify under
certain limited exceptions. However, the EIT Law gives FIEs established before
March 16, 2007, or Old FIEs, a five-year grandfather period during which they
can continue to enjoy their existing preferential tax treatments. During this
five-year grandfather period, Old FIEs that enjoyed tax rates lower than 25%
under the original EIT Law can gradually increase their EIT rate by 2% per year
until their tax rate reaches 25%. In addition, the Old FIEs that are eligible
for the &#147;two-year exemption and three-year half reduction&#148; or &#147;five-year
exemption and five-year half-reduction&#148; under the original EIT law, are allowed
to continue enjoying their preference until these holidays expire. </P>
<P align=justify>In addition to the changes to the current tax structure, under
the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with &#147;de facto
management bodies&#148; within China is considered a resident enterprise and will
normally be subject to an EIT of 25% on its global income. The implementing
rules define the term &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; as &#147;an establishment that
exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the production,
business, personnel, accounting, etc., of a Chinese enterprise.&#148; If the PRC tax
authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident
enterprise, then our organization&#146;s global income will be subject to PRC income
tax of 25%. For detailed discussion of PRC tax issues related to resident
enterprise status, see Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors &#150; Risks Related to Doing Business
in China &#150; Under the New Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a
&#145;resident enterprise&#146; of China. Such classification will likely result in
unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.&#148;</P>

<P align=justify>The principal regulation governing foreign currency exchange in
China is the Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended (2008).
Under these Rules, RMB is freely convertible for current account items, such as
trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital
account items, such as direct investment, loan or investment in securities
outside China unless the prior approval of, and/or registration with, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange of the People&#146;s Republic of China, or SAFE,
or its local counterparts (as the case may be) is obtained. </P>
<P align=justify>Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, FIEs in
China may purchase foreign currency without the approval of SAFE for trade and
service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents
evidencing these transactions. They may also retain foreign exchange (subject to
a cap approved by SAFE) to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay
dividends. In addition, if a foreign company acquires a company in China, the
acquired company will also become an FIE. However, the relevant PRC government
authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of FIEs to purchase and retain
foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for
direct investment, loan and investment in securities outside China are still
subject to limitations and require approvals from, and/or registration with,
SAFE.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Dividend Distributions</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Under applicable PRC regulations, FIEs in China may pay
dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in
accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a FIE in
China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC
accounting standards each year to its general reserves until the accumulative
amount of such reserves reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are
not distributable as cash dividends. The board of directors of a FIE also has
the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to staff welfare
and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the
event of liquidation. </P>

<P align=justify>As of December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 1,446
full-time employees, including Shandong Taibang and Dalin and all of their
subsidiaries and Taibang Medical, of which approximately 104 were seconded to us
by the Shandong Institute. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship
with our employees and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or
any difficulties in recruiting staff for our operations. As required by
applicable Chinese law, we have entered into employment contracts with most of
our officers, managers and employees. The PRC enacted a new Labor Contract Law,
which became effective on January 1, 2008. We have updated our employment
contracts and employee handbook and are in compliance with the new law. We will
work with the employees and the labor union to insure that our employees obtain
the full benefit of the law. We do not anticipate that changes in the law will
materially impact our balance sheet and cash flows. </P>

<P align=justify><B>RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS</B></P>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><i><b>
<p>We identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial
reporting that require us to restate our financial statements. </p>
</b></i>
<p align="justify">Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer and effected by our board of directors to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the
preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over
financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately reflect the
transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the
authorization of our board of directors and management; and provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our
financial statements. </p>
<p align="justify">Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control &#150;
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation under the criteria established in
Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31,
2010 because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting described below. A material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB
Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. </p>
<p align="justify">Management believes that, as of December 31, 2010, our
corporate accounting lacked the expertise in nonrecurring transactions to
effectively recognize deferred tax liabilities and derivative instrument
valuation review controls, which resulted in an inadvertent omission of the fair
value of embedded options in warrants and a misinterpretation of US GAAP
regarding the recognition of deferred tax liabilities upon a business
combination. We have taken measures to remediate these material weaknesses by
adding two additional qualified accountants in late 2010, and we have engaged
outside consultants specializing in deferred tax accounting and derivative
instrument valuation. We have also implemented more formal review procedures and
documentation standards for the accounting and monitoring of non-routine and
complex transactions and will continue to evaluate other measures to enhance the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. </p>
</font>
<P align=justify><B><I>We face risks related to general domestic and global
economic conditions and to the credit crisis. Disruptions in the capital and
credit markets related to the current national and worldwide financial crisis,
which may continue indefinitely or intensify, could adversely affect our results
of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers,
suppliers and creditors. </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We currently generate sufficient operating cash flows, which
combined with access to the credit markets, provide us with significant
discretionary funding capacity. However, the current uncertainty arising out of
domestic and global economic conditions, including the disruption in credit
markets, may impact our ability to manage normal relationships with our
customers, suppliers and creditors. The disruptions in the capital and credit
markets may continue indefinitely or intensify, and adversely impact our results
of operations, cash flows and financial condition, or those of our customers,
suppliers and creditors. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a
result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or
failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access
to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our businesses or conduct acquisitions
or make other discretionary investments. Such disruptions may also adversely
impact the capital needs of our customers and suppliers, which, in turn, could
adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
</P>
<P align=justify>In addition, the demand for our products is largely affected by
the general economic conditions in China as our products are still not
affordable to many patients. As China's economy grows, we expect more Chinese
people will become consumers of medical treatments and procedures, including
procedures requiring human plasma. However, we expect that continuation of the
global economic slowdown may result in slower economic growth in China and an
unfavorable economic environment which in turn may make our products less
affordable to more patients and result in an overall decreased demand for our
products. Such reductions and disruptions could have a material adverse effect
on our business operations. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>In order to grow at the pace expected by management, we
will require additional capital to support our long-term business plan. If we
are unable to obtain additional capital in future years, we may be unable to
proceed with our long-term business plan and we may be forced to curtail or
cease our operations or further business expansion. </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We will require additional working capital to support our
long-term business plan, which includes identifying suitable targets for
horizontal or vertical mergers or acquisitions, so as to enhance the overall
productivity and benefit from economies of scale. Our working capital
requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities, if any,
will vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the volume of business
during the period and payment terms with our customers. We may not be able to
obtain adequate levels of additional financing, whether through equity
financing, debt financing or other sources, especially in light of the global
financial crisis and the market downturn. To raise funds, we may need to issue
new equities or bonds which could result in additional dilution to our
shareholders and investors. Additional financings could result in significant
dilution to our earnings per share or the issuance of securities with rights
superior to our current outstanding securities or contain covenants that would
restrict our operations and strategy. In addition, we may grant registration
rights to investors purchasing our equity or debt securities in the future. If
we are unable to raise additional financing, we may be unable to implement our
long-term business plan, develop or enhance our products and services, take
advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures on a
timely basis. In addition, a lack of additional financing could force us to
substantially curtail or cease operations. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our limited operating history may not serve as an
adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of
operations.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We have a limited operating history. Shandong Taibang as began
its operation in October 2002. With the rapid growth of the industry, it has
experienced a high growth rate since 2002. Furthermore, we did not acquire a
controlling interest in Shandong Taibang until September 2005 and Guizhou
Taibang until January 2009. As such, our historical operating results may not
provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business, financial performance
and prospects. We may not be able to achieve a similar growth rate in future
periods. Accordingly, you should not rely on our results of operations for any
prior periods as an indication of our future performance. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We have a significant amount of debt, which could have
negative consequences to us.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We have certain amount of debt. As of December 31, 2010, we
had, on a consolidated basis, approximately $3.0 million principal amount of
indebtedness outstanding. Our substantial indebtedness could have important
consequences, including: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <P>increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry
  conditions and adverse changes in governmental regulations; </P>
  <LI>
  <P>limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital
  expenditures and other general corporate requirements; </P>
  <LI>
  <P>requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from
  operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability
  of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures or other general corporate
  purposes; </P>
  <LI>
  <P>limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our
  business and the industry in which we operate; and </P>
  <LI>
  <P>placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged
  competitors. </P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify>Our ability to pay interest on our indebtedness and to satisfy
our other debt obligations will depend upon, among other things, our future
operating performance and cash flow and our ability to refinance indebtedness
when necessary. Each of these factors is, to a large extent, dependent on general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If in the future
we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to make scheduled payments on
our indebtedness or to meet our liquidity needs or other obligations, we will
need to refinance our existing debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our
debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, our interest
expense may increase if general economic conditions result in an increasing
interest rate environment. We cannot assure you that our business will generate
cash flow, or that we will be able to obtain funding sufficient to satisfy our
debt service requirements. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Our cash flow could be negatively affected as a result of
our extension of relatively long payment terms to customers that we believe are
credit worthy.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>As is customary in our industry, we extend relatively long
payment terms (up to six months) to customers that we believe are credit worthy.
The dollar amount of our accounts receivable, net of our allowance for doubtful
accounts as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $9,922,111, $1,767,076 and
$313,087, respectively. The bad debt (credit) expenses for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $(57,623), $(13,089) and $(56,462),
respectively. Although we attempt to establish appropriate reserves for our
receivables, those reserves may not prove to be adequate in view of actual
levels of bad debts. The failure of our customers to pay us timely would
negatively affect our working capital, which could in turn adversely affect our
cash flow. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>If the PRC government bans or limits plasma-based
biopharmaceutical products, our operations, revenues and profitability would be
adversely affected. </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The principal raw materials of our existing and planned
biopharmaceutical products is human source plasma, which, due to its unique
nature, is subject to various quality and safety control issues which include,
but are not limited to, contaminations and blood-borne diseases. In addition,
limitations of current technology pose biological hazards inherent in plasma
that have yet to be discovered which could result in a wide spread epidemic due
to blood infusion. The primary law that regulates plasma products in China is
the PRC Pharmaceutical Law, the Implementation Rules on the PRC Pharmaceutical
Law and the Regulations on the Administration of Blood Products. These rules and
regulations require entities producing blood products to strictly comply with
certain hygienic standards and specifications promulgated by the government. In
the event that human plasma is discovered to be noncompliant with the
government's hygienic standards and specifications, the health department may
revoke the registration and/or the approval of the blood product, or otherwise
limit the use of such blood product. If the PRC government bans or limits
plasma-based biopharmaceutical products, our operations, revenues and
profitability would be adversely affected. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>If the plasma we source is found to be contaminated, our
operation, revenues and profitability would be adversely affected.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We currently source plasma mainly from human donations to our
plasma stations in Shandong, Guangxi and Guizhou Provinces. If any of our human
donors is infected with certain diseases, then the plasma from such donor may be
infected. If such contaminated plasma is not appropriately screened out, our
entire plasma source for the relevant collection station may become
contaminated. If the plasma from our collection stations is found to be
contaminated, our operation, revenues and profitability would be adversely
affected. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>If our supply of quality plasma is interrupted, our
results of operations and profitability will be adversely affected.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The production of plasma-based biopharmaceutical products
relies on the supply of plasma of suitable quality. For the years ended December
31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the cost of plasma used by us for production accounted
for approximately 73%, 83% and 76%, respectively, of total production cost. The
supply and market prices of plasma may be adversely affected by factors such as
regulatory restrictions, weather conditions or outbreak of diseases which would
impact our costs of production. We may not be able to pass on any resulting
increase in costs to our customers and therefore any substantial fluctuation in
supply or market prices of plasma may adversely affect our results of operations
and profitability. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>The biopharmaceutical industry in the PRC is strictly
regulated and changes in such regulations may have an adverse effect on our
business.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The biopharmaceutical industry in the PRC is strictly regulated
by the government. The regulatory regime, such as administrative approval of
medicines and production approvals, comprises of series of regulations and
administrative rules. The PRC regulatory authorities may amend such regulations
and administrative rules and promulgate new regulations and administrative rules
from time to time. Changes in these regulations and administrative rules could
have a significant impact on our business. Such changes may have any adverse
impact on our business. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>We may not be able to carry on our business if we lose
any of the permits and licenses required by the PRC Government in order to carry
on our business.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>All pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution enterprises
in the PRC are required to obtain from various PRC governmental authorities
certain permits and licenses, including, in the case of manufacturing
enterprises, a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit and, in the case of
distribution enterprises, a Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit. </P>
<P align=justify>We have obtained permits and licenses and the GMP certificates,
required for the manufacturing and sales of our pharmaceutical products. These
permits and licenses held by us are subject to periodic renewal and/or
reassessment by the relevant PRC Government authorities and the standards of
compliance required in relation thereto may from time to time be subject to
changes. We intend to apply for the renewal of such permits and licenses when
required by applicable laws and regulations. Any changes in compliance
standards, or any new laws or regulations that may prohibit or render it more
restrictive for us to conduct our business or increase our compliance costs may
adversely affect our operations or profitability. Any failure by us to obtain
such renewals may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our
business. In addition, we may not be able to carry on business without such
permits and business licenses being renewed. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>If we do not receive PRC governmental approval to
increase the retail prices of certain of our biopharmaceutical products our
revenues may be adversely affected.</I></B></P>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p align="justify">Retail prices of certain of our biopharmaceutical products in
the PRC are subject to the control of the relevant central and provincial price
administration authorities. The actual price for any given price-controlled
product set by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers cannot exceed the price
ceiling imposed in accordance with the applicable government price control
rules. Pharmaceutical products which are included in China&#146;s National (Medical) Insurance
Catalogue, or the NIC, administered at the central or provincial level are
subject to price control by the National Reform and Development Commission of
China, or the NDRC, China&#146;s pricing authority. </p>
<p align="justify">The 2009 NIC was published by China's Ministry of Human
Resources and Social Security in November, 2009 as part of China's healthcare
reform, to make more drugs affordable to PRC consumers. The NIC is China&#146;s
official drug reimbursement list for its universal healthcare system, which the
PRC government expected to cover 90% of PRC citizens as at the 2010 year end.
The 2009 NIC features 2,151 drugs, categorized as Class A (fully covered) or
Class B (partially covered). Five of our principal products, Human Albumin Human
Immunoglobulin for intravenous injection, Human Rabies Immunoglobulin, Human
Tetanus Immunoglobulin, Human Immunoglobulin have been included in the 2009 NIC
as Class B drugs and are subject to national price control by the NDRC. </p>
<p align="justify">The 2009 NIC was expected to be fully implemented in 2010,
but has been postponed. Once the 2009 NIC is fully implemented, the price of our
included products may not be increased at our discretion above the relevant
controlled retail price ceiling without prior governmental approval. This, in
turn, may affect the ex-factory prices set by us for our products and we
therefore do not have unfettered freedom to maximize our profits. It is
uncertain whether we will be able to obtain necessary approvals to increase the
price of any of our products. </p>
</font>
<P align=justify><B><I>If we are unable to adequately monitor our plasma
stations our plasma supply may be tainted and we will be subject to sanctions by
the government which would have a material adverse effect on our
business.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>As part of the industry reform initiative by the Chinese
government, in 2006 we acquired the assets of five of the six then existing
plasma stations in Shandong Province through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Xia
Jin Plasma Company, the Qi He Plasma Company, the He Ze Plasma Company, the
Zhang Qiu Plasma Company and the Liao Cheng Plasma Company. We received permits
to operate these subsidiaries in January 2007. In April 2007, we acquired the
assets of two additional plasma stations, one through Huan Jiang Plasma Company
and the other through Fang Cheng Plasma Company, which is then 80% owned by
Shandong Taibang and 20% owned by Feng Lin, an unrelated third party, which we
subsequently acquired in January 2010. We obtained necessary permits and
commenced their operation in July and August 2007, respectively. In 2010, we
established two plasma stations, Yi Shui Plasma Company, which has begun
operation in December 2010, and Ning Yang Plasma Company, which is still under
construction. Guizhou Taibang, the main operating subsidiary of Dalin, is the
85% owner of the seven plasma stations in Guizhou province. Huitian, the 35%
minority owned affiliated company by the Company, has three plasma stations
operating in Shaanxi province. While we monitor our blood plasma intake
procedures through frequent unscheduled inspections of our stations, there
remains a risk that our blood supply may become tainted during the collection
process. Our blood supply may become tainted if we accept blood from donors
whose blood shows any irregular findings including HIV, Hepatitis C and liver
disease. We pre-screen all donors in order to ensure that these diseases are not
present. If our blood supply becomes tainted, the consequences for our business
could be severe. We could be subject to civil liability from suits brought by
consumers and to criminal liability and loss of our registration if we are found
by the government to have been criminally negligent. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our operations, sales, profit and cash flow will be
adversely affected if our albumin products fail inspection or are delayed by
regulators.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Each batch of our albumin products requires inspection by
Chinese government regulators before we can ship it to our customers. The SFDA
has a quality standard which considers, among other things, the appearance,
packing capacity, thermal stability, pH value, protein content and percentage of
purity of the product. In order to pass inspection, our plasma must test
negative for any blood irregularities, including Hepatitis C, HIV and liver
disease. The plasma must be packaged in 25 to 30 separate 600g bags and boxed
with a packing list and labeled to be consistent with computer records. The
plasma must then be stored at -20&#176;C as soon as possible after collection to
ensure that it will congeal within 6 hours. Government regulators usually take
one month to inspect a batch of albumin products. The process begins when the
regulator randomly selects samples of our albumin products and delivers them to
the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological
Products, or the NICBPB, in Beijing for testing, and the process ends when the
products are given final approval by the NICBPB. In the event that the
regulators delay the approval of our products, change the requirements in such a
way that we are unable to comply with those requirements, or require our other
products to be inspected by regulators before we can ship them to our customers,
our operations, sales, profit and cash flow will be adversely affected. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>We rely on a Secondment Agreement with the Shandong
Institute, which is expected to terminate upon the future privatization of the
Shandong Institute, for over 39% of our Shandong Taibang employees. If the
Secondment Agreement is breached or terminated, it could have an adverse effect
on our operations and on our financial results.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The Shandong Institute has provided us with approximately 104
of our employees out of a total of approximately 1,446 employees, pursuant to a
secondment agreement, or Secondment Agreement, dated October 28, 2002, between
Shandong Taibang and the Shandong Institute. Pursuant to the Secondment
Agreement, we are responsible for the salaries of these employees, as well as
for their social benefits such as insurance. Our Secondment Agreement with the
Shandong Institute will expire on the sooner to occur of October 2032 or upon
the privatization of the Shandong Institute, which was originally expected to
occur before the end of 2008. However, the completion of privatization of
Shandong Institute has been further delayed indefinitely due to slower action
taken by the Shandong Ministry of Health in implementing the privatization plan.
Upon expiration or termination of the Secondment Agreement, we plan to hire the
seconded employees directly. However, we cannot be sure that all of the
employees will accept our employment offers at that time. Guang Li Pang,
Shandong Taibang&#146;s Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Yun Hua Gao and Dian Cong
Liu, our Senior Technical Advisors are employed through the Secondment
Agreement. Although none of our seconded employees have indicated that they do
not plan to continue working for our Company after the privatization, if the
Secondment Agreement is terminated or expires and we are unable to hire those
employees or replacement employees on time, our operations, as well as our
financial results, may suffer. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>If the distributors who we rely on do not purchase our
products, our business and results of operations will be adversely
affected.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We sell almost a half of our products in China through our
network of about 279 distributors located in about 30 provinces and municipal
cities throughout China. While we have established working relationships with
many of our distributors and strictly regulate their sales and marketing
activities by annual distribution agreements, there are no restrictions in these
distribution agreements preventing our distributors from also supplying products
produced by our competitors. Our own marketing and sales staff work to develop
and maintain relationships with our distributors, but there can be no assurance
that we will be able to maintain such relationships. For the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, direct sales to distributors represented
approximately 48.9%, 67.3% and 65.6%, respectively, of our total revenues. If a
number of our distributors cease to purchase our products and we are unable to
find suitable replacements, our business and results of operations will be
adversely affected. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our inability to successfully research and develop new
biological pharmaceutical products could have an adverse effect on our future
growth.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We believe that the successful development of biological
pharmaceutical products can be affected by many factors. Products that appear to
be promising in the early phases of research and development may fail to be
commercialized for various reasons, including the failure to obtain the
necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, the research and development cycles
for new medicine for which we must obtain a Certificate of New Medicine from the
PRC Ministry of Health, is a relatively lengthy process. In our experience, the
process of conducting research and various tests on new products before
obtaining a Certificate of New Medicine and subsequent procedures may take
approximately three to five years. There is no assurance that our future
research and development projects will be successful or that they will be
completed within the anticipated time frame or budget. Also, there is no
guarantee that we will receive the necessary approvals from relevant authorities
for the production of our newly developed products. Even if such products could
be successfully commercialized, there is no assurance that they will be accepted
by the market as anticipated. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our financial position and operations may be materially
and adversely affected if our product liability insurance does not sufficiently
cover our liabilities.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Under current PRC laws, manufacturers and vendors of defective
products in the PRC may incur liability for loss and injury caused by such
products. Pursuant to the General Principles of the Civil Law of the PRC, or the
PRC Civil Law, which became effective in 1987, a defective product which causes
property damage or physical injury to any person may subject the manufacturer or
vendor of such product to civil liability. </P>
<P align=justify>In 1993, the PRC promulgated the Product Quality Law of the
PRC, or the Product Quality Law, which was revised in 2000. The Product Quality
Law was enacted to protect the rights and interests of end-users and consumers
and to strengthen the supervision and control of the quality of products. Under
the Product Quality Law, manufacturers who produce defective products may be
subject to fines and required to cease production, and in severe cases, be
subject to criminal liability and may have their business licenses revoked. </P>
<P align=justify>In 1993, the Law of the PRC on the Protection of the Rights and
Interests of Consumers, or the Consumers' Rights Law, was promulgated to further
protect the legal rights and interests of consumers in connection with the

<P align=justify>We maintain two product liability insurances for sales in the
PRC for Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang&#146;s products in the amount of
approximately $3.0 million (RMB 20 million) each. Although no one has filed any
claims in relation to the use of our pharmaceutical products, our financial
position and operations may be materially and adversely affected, if our
insurance coverage is insufficient to cover a successful claim. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We may encounter increased competition from both local
and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises as a result of a relaxation of the PRC
regulatory approval process for plasma-based biopharmaceutical products or a
relaxation of international trade restrictions. A change in our competitive
environment could adversely affect our profitability and prospects.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Our continued ability to compete depends on the development of
the plasma-based biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China. The
plasma-based biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China is highly
regulated by both provincial and central governments. Prior to engaging in the
collection and production of plasma products, companies such as ours are
required to obtain collection permits from the central health department and
production permits and certificates for each new product formulation from the
various provincial food and drug authorities. We have the advantage of being
already approved by the state to collect plasma from human donors and
manufacture and sell plasma-based biopharmaceutical products in Shandong
Province, as well as in all other provinces in China, and our research and
development department has become familiar with the provincial product approval
process. However, although we believe that the regulatory requirements pose a
competitive barrier to entry into the biopharmaceutical industry, over time
there may be new entrants. If the government relaxes these restrictions and
allow more competitors to enter into the market, these competitors may have more
capital, better research and development resources, manufacturing and marketing
capability and experience than us. Our profitability may be adversely affected
if (i) competition intensifies; (ii) competitors drastically reduce prices; or
(iii) competitors develop new products having comparable medicinal applications
or therapeutic effects which are more effective or less costly than those
produced by us. </P>
<P align=justify>In addition we expect that competition from imported products
will increase as a result of a trend towards lower import tariffs and China's
admission as a member of the WTO in December 2001. We believe that lower import
tariffs will result in more affordable pricing for imported biopharmaceutical
products manufactured overseas as compared to domestically manufactured products
such as ours. In addition, China's membership in the WTO makes it more
accessible to foreign biopharmaceutical manufacturers who may wish to set up
production facilities in the PRC and compete directly with domestic
manufacturers. The expected increased supply of both domestic and foreign
competitively priced biopharmaceutical products in the PRC will result in
increased competition. There is no assurance that our strategies to remain
competitive can be implemented successfully as scheduled or at all. Our
inability to remain competitive may have an adverse effect on our profitability
and prospects. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We depend heavily on key personnel, and turnover of key
employees and senior management could harm our business.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Our success, to a certain extent, is attributable to the
expertise and experience of our senior management and key research and technical
personnel, including Chao-Ming Zhao, our Chief Executive Officer, Y. Tristan
Kuo, our President, Stanley Lau, our Chief Financial Officerand Yiwu Xie, the
Chief Technical Officer of the Company, who carry out key functions in our
operation. If we lose the service of any of our senior management or key
research or technical personnel or fail to attract additional personnel with
suitable experience and qualification, our business operations and research
capability may be adversely affected.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Our senior management and employees have worked together
for a short period of time, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate
their effectiveness and ability to address challenges.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Due to our limited operating history and recent additions to
our management team, certain of our senior management and employees have worked
together at our company for only a relatively short period of time.
Specifically, Chao Ming Zhao became our Chief Executive Officer in June 2008
after serving as our Chief Financial Officer since November 2006 and Y. Tristan
Kuo became our Chief Financial Officer in June 2008 and had served as our Vice
President-Finance since September 2007. Stanley Lau became our President in
December 2010. Siu Ling Chan became our directors in July 2006. While Mr. Zhao
and Ms. Chen were employed in various capacities by Logic Express and Shandong
Taibang, Mr. Lau is a relative newcomer to our Company. As a result of these
circumstances, it may be difficult for you to evaluate the effectiveness of our
senior management and other key employees and their ability to address future
challenges to our business.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Future acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our
ability to manage our business.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Selective acquisitions form part of our strategy to further
expand our business. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may
acquire additional companies, products or technologies. Future acquisitions and
the subsequent integration of new companies into ours would require significant
attention from our management. Our company has little experience with
integrating newly acquired businesses. Potential problems encountered by each
organization during mergers and acquisitions would be unique, posing additional
risks to the company. The diversion of our management's attention and any
difficulties encountered in any integration process could have an adverse effect
on our ability to manage our business. Future acquisitions would expose us to
potential risks, including risks associated with the assimilation of new
operations, technologies and personnel, unforeseen or hidden liabilities, the
diversion of resources from our existing businesses and technologies, the inability to generate
sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions, and
potential loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees, customers and
suppliers as a result of integration of new businesses. </P>

<P align=justify><B><I>We may lose our competitive advantage and our operations
may suffer if we fail to prevent the loss or misappropriation of, or disputes

<P align=justify>None of our products are currently covered by patents. The
trademark &#147;Lu Yue&#148; is licensed to us by the Shandong Institute for our use as in
the labeling of human-use medicine, biopreparate and blood products, pursuant to
a trademark license agreement, dated February 27, 2007. We plan to apply for
patents for our manufacturing processes. The patent application will be subject
to approval from the relevant PRC authorities. We may not be able to
successfully obtain the approval of the PRC authorities for our patent
applications. Furthermore, third parties may assert claims to our proprietary
procedures, technologies and systems. These proprietary procedures, technologies
and systems are important to our business as they allow us to maintain our
competitive edge over our competitors. </P>
<P align=justify>While we are not aware of any infringement on our intellectual
property and we have not been notified by any third party that we are infringing
on their intellectual property, our ability to compete successfully and to
achieve future revenue growth will depend, in significant part, on our ability
to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the
intellectual property rights of others. The legal regime in China for the
protection of intellectual property rights is still at its early stage of
development. Intellectual property protection became a national effort in China
in 1979 when China adopted its first statute on the protection of trademarks.
Since then, China has adopted its Patent Law, Trademark Law and Copyright Law
and promulgated related regulations such as Regulation on Computer Software
Protection, Regulation on the Protection of Layout Designs of Integrated
Circuits and Regulation on Internet Domain Names. China has also acceded to
various international treaties and conventions in this area, such as the Paris
Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, Patent Cooperation Treaty,
Madrid Agreement and its Protocol Concerning the International Registration of
Marks. In addition, when China became a party to the World Trade Organization in
2001, China amended many of its laws and regulations to comply with the
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Despite many
laws and regulations promulgated and other efforts made by China over the years
with a view to tightening up its regulation and protection of intellectual
property rights, private parties may not enjoy intellectual property rights in
China to the same extent as they would in many Western countries, including the
United States, and enforcement of such laws and regulations in China have not
achieved the levels reached in those countries. Both the administrative agencies
and the court system in China are not well-equipped to deal with violations or
handle the nuances and complexities between compliant technological innovation
and noncompliant infringement. </P>
<P align=justify>We rely on confidentiality agreements with our management and
employees to protect our confidential proprietary information. However, the
protection of our intellectual properties may be compromised as a result of:
</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>departure of any of our management members or employees in possession of
  our confidential proprietary information;
  <LI>breach by such departing management member or employee of his or her
  confidentiality and non- disclosure undertaking to us;
  <LI>infringement by others of our proprietary information and intellectual
  property rights; or
  <LI>refusal by relevant regulatory authorities to approve our patent or
  trademark applications. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>Any of these events or occurrences may have a material adverse
effect on our operations and the measures that we have put into place to protect
our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient. Litigation to enforce
our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and may not
be successful. If we are not able to successfully defend our intellectual
property rights, we might lose rights to technology that we need to conduct and
develop our business. This may seriously harm our business, operating results
and financial condition, and enable our competitors to use our intellectual
property to compete against us. </P>
<P align=justify>Furthermore, if third parties claim that our products infringe
their patents or other intellectual property rights, we may be required to
devote substantial resources to defend against such claims. If we are
unsuccessful in defending against such infringement claims, we may be required
to pay damages, modify our products or suspend the production and sale of such
products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to modify our products on
commercially reasonable terms. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>A disruption in the supply of utilities, fire or other
calamity at our manufacturing plant would disrupt production of our products and
adversely affect our sales.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Our products are manufactured at our production facilities
located in Tai&#146;an, Shandong Province and Guiyang, Guizhou Province in the PRC.
While we have not in the past experienced any calamities which disrupted
production, any disruption in the supply of utilities, in particular,
electricity or power supply, or any outbreak of fire, flood or other calamity
resulting in significant damage at our facilities would severely affect our
production and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. </P>
<P align=justify>We maintain insurance policies covering losses with respect to
damages to our properties and products. We do not have insurance coverage for
inventories of raw materials or business interruption. There is no assurance

<P align=justify><B><I>There are allegations of past criminal conduct against
certain members of our Board of Directors and a significant employee. Our
business and results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these
allegations are proven true. </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>On January 26, 2010, certain allegations of fraud and criminal
activity involving smuggling and related activities allegedly engaged in prior
to 2005 by the CEO of the Company's primary operating subsidiary, Shandong
Taibang, and by a relative of one of our directors surfaced on certain financial
websites. On January 27, 2010, in response to these allegations, the Company's
board of directors established a special independent subcommittee comprised of
the Company's independent directors, Mr. Sean Shao and Dr. Tong Jun Lin (who
were later joined by new director Dr. Xiangmin Cui), or the Special Committee,
to investigate the allegations with the assistance of a reputable international
firm, and report its findings to the board of directors as soon as practicable.
On March 1, 2010, the Special Committee retained O'Melveny &amp; Myers LLP, an
international law firm, to advise the Special Committee and to assist in the
investigation of the allegations. On November 26, 2010, the Special Committee
reported its findings to the Company&#146;s board of directors, a summary of which
the Company disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission
on December 3, 2010. The Special Committee could not find support for a majority
of the allegations, however, the Special Committee found support that Mr. Ze Qin
Lin, the husband of our former director Ms. Lin Ling Li, was imprisoned in China
in connection with smuggling offenses, and with respect to the allegation that
Mr. Tung Lam, the Chief Executive Officer of one of our primary operating
subsidiaries, Shandong Taibang, and spouse of Mrs. Siu Ling Chan, our board
chair, was previously known as Mr. Lin Ziping and was imprisoned for smuggling
offenses in China, the Special Committee found evidence supporting Mr. Lam's
denial of the allegation, as well as conflicting evidence with respect to this
claim. As a result, the Special Committee concluded that it could neither
confirm nor exclude the allegation against Mr. Lam. The findings of the Special
Committee regarding Mr. Lin and its inability to reach a conclusion regarding
the allegations against Mr. Lam may make investing in our Company unattractive
to certain investors and may cause existing investors to end their investment in
the Company, which may cause our stock price to decline. </P>

<B>RISKS RELATED TO DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA</B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Changes in China's political or economic situation could
harm us and our operating results.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Economic reforms adopted by the Chinese government have had a
positive effect on the economic development of the country, but the government
could change these economic reforms or any of the legal systems at any time.
This could either benefit or damage our operations and profitability. Some of
the things that could have this effect are: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>Level of government involvement in the economy;
  <LI>Control of foreign exchange;
  <LI>Methods of allocating resources;
  <LI>Balance of payments position;
  <LI>International trade restrictions; and
  <LI>International conflict. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most
countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, or OECD, in many ways. For example, state-owned enterprises still
constitute a large portion of the Chinese economy, and weak corporate governance
and the lack of a flexible currency exchange policy still prevail in China. As a
result of these differences, we may not develop in the same way or at the same
rate as might be expected if the Chinese economy was similar to those of the
OECD member countries.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could
limit the legal protections available to you and us.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We conduct substantially all of our business through our
operating subsidiaries in the PRC. Our operating subsidiaries are generally
subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and,
in particular, laws applicable to FIEs. The PRC legal system is based on written
statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited
precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have
significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign
investments in China. However, since the PRC legal system continues to evolve
rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations, and rules are not always
uniform, and enforcement of these laws, regulations, and rules involve
uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us. In
addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial
costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, most of
our executive officers and directors are residents of China and not of the
United States, and substantially all the assets of these persons are located
outside the United States. As a result, it could be difficult for investors to
affect service of process in the United States or to enforce a judgment obtained
in the United States against our Chinese operations and subsidiary.</P>
<P align=center>23</P>
<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center width="100%" color=black
noShade SIZE=5>
<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_27></A>
<P align=justify><B><I>You may have difficulty enforcing judgments against
us.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Most of our assets are located outside of the United States and
most of our current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, most of
our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than
the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons is
located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to
effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may
also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil
liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our
officers and directors, most of whom are not residents in the United States and
the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United
States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC
would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Our counsel as to PRC law
has advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are
provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Courts in China may recognize
and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC
Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between China and the country where the
judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have
any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition,
according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a
foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that
the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty,
security, or the public interest. So it is uncertain whether a PRC court would
enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>The PRC government exerts substantial influence over the
manner in which we must conduct our business activities.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise
substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through
regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by
changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation,
import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property,
and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material
compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the
central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose
new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would
require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance
with such regulations or interpretations. </P>
<P align=justify>Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any
decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a
more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the
implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic
conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest
ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.
</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Future inflation in China may inhibit our ability to
conduct business in China.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of
rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past ten
years, the rate of inflation in China has been as high as 5.9% and as low as
-0.8%. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from
time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the
availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation
may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit
and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in
China, and thereby harm the market for our products and our company. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability
to receive and use our sales effectively.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The majority of our sales will be settled in RMB, and any
future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue
generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or to make
dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government
introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for
current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including
primarily the restriction that FIEs may only buy, sell or remit foreign
currencies after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks in China
authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of RMB
for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to
governmental approval in China, and companies are required to open and maintain
separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. We cannot be
certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent
restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our
business and the value of our securities.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The value of our common stock will be indirectly affected by
the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB and between those
currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated.
Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar
would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving
effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any
dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars, as well as earnings
from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the
future. </P>

<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_28></A>
<P align=justify>Since July 2005, the RMB has no longer been pegged to the U.S.
dollar. Although the People&#146;s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign
exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange
rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the
U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the
future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange
rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market. </P>
<P align=justify>Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to
reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered
into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in
the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be
limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In
addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange
control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign
currencies. Currently, some of our raw materials and major equipment are
imported. In the event that the U.S. dollars appreciate against RMB, our costs
will increase. If we cannot pass the resulting cost increases on to our
customers, our profitability and operating results will suffer. In addition, if
our sales to international customers grow, we will be increasingly subject to
the risk of foreign currency depreciation. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Restrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries&#146;
ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely
affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit
our business, pay dividends to you, and otherwise fund and conduct our
business.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Substantially all of our sales are earned by our PRC
subsidiaries. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC
subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent
companies. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC
subsidiaries only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined
in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC
subsidiaries are also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at
least 10% of their annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC
GAAP to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches
50% of their registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds
can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the
form of loans, advances, or cash dividends. Any limitations on the ability of
our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely
limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be
beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our
business. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Failure to comply with PRC regulations relating to the
establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject
our PRC resident stockholders to personal liability, limit our ability to
acquire PRC companies or to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our
PRC subsidiaries&#146; ability to distribute profits to us or otherwise materially
adversely affect us.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In October 2005, SAFE issued the Notice on Relevant Issues in
the Foreign Exchange Control over Financing and Return Investment Through
Special Purpose Companies by Residents Inside China, generally referred to as
Circular 75, which required PRC residents to register with the competent local
SAFE branch before establishing or acquiring control over an offshore special
purpose company, or SPV, for the purpose of engaging in an equity financing
outside of China on the strength of domestic PRC assets originally held by those
residents. Internal implementing guidelines issued by SAFE, which became public
in June 2007 (known as Notice 106), expanded the reach of Circular 75 by (1)
purporting to cover the establishment or acquisition of control by PRC residents
of offshore entities which merely acquire &#147;control&#148; over domestic companies or
assets, even in the absence of legal ownership; (2) adding requirements relating
to the source of the PRC resident's funds used to establish or acquire the
offshore entity; (3) covering the use of existing offshore entities for offshore
financings; (4) purporting to cover situations in which an offshore SPV
establishes a new subsidiary in China or acquires an unrelated company or
unrelated assets in China; and (5) making the domestic affiliate of the SPV
responsible for the accuracy of certain documents which must be filed in
connection with any such registration, notably, the business plan which
describes the overseas financing and the use of proceeds. Amendments to
registrations made under Circular 75 are required in connection with any
increase or decrease of capital, transfer of shares, mergers and acquisitions,
equity investment or creation of any security interest in any assets located in
China to guarantee offshore obligations, and Notice 106 makes the offshore SPV
jointly responsible for these filings. In the case of an SPV which was
established, and which acquired a related domestic company or assets, before the
implementation date of Circular 75, a retroactive SAFE registration was required
to have been completed before March 31, 2006. This date was subsequently
extended indefinitely by Notice 106, which also required that the registrant
establish that all foreign exchange transactions undertaken by the SPV and its
affiliates were in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to
comply with the requirements of Circular 75, as applied by SAFE in accordance
with Notice 106, may result in fines and other penalties under PRC laws for
evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions. Any such failure could also
result in the SPV&#146;s affiliates being impeded or prevented from distributing
their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or
liquidation to the SPV, or from engaging in other transfers of funds into or out
of China.</P>
<P align=justify>We have asked our stockholders who are PRC residents as defined
in Circular 75 to register with the relevant branch of SAFE, as currently
required, in connection with their equity interests in us and our acquisitions
of equity interests in our PRC subsidiaries. However, we cannot provide any
assurances that they can obtain the above SAFE registrations required by
Circular 75 and Notice 106. Moreover, because of uncertainty over how Circular
75 will be interpreted and implemented, and how or whether SAFE will apply it to
us, we cannot predict how it will affect our business operations or future
strategies. For example, our present and prospective PRC subsidiaries&#146; ability
to conduct foreign exchange activities, such as the remittance of
dividends and foreign currency-denominated borrowings, may be subject to
compliance with Circular 75 and Notice 106 by our PRC resident beneficial
holders. </P>

<P align=justify>In addition, such PRC residents may not always be able to
complete the necessary registration procedures required by Circular 75 and
Notice 106. We also have little control over either our present or prospective
direct or indirect stockholders or the outcome of such registration procedures.
A failure by our PRC resident beneficial holders or future PRC resident
stockholders to comply with Circular 75 and Notice 106, if SAFE requires it,
could subject these PRC resident beneficial holders to fines or legal sanctions,
restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our
subsidiaries&#146; ability to make distributions or pay dividends or affect our
ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and
prospects.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We may be unable to complete a business combination
transaction efficiently or on favorable terms due to complicated merger and
acquisition regulations which became effective on September 8, 2006.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>On August 9, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the
China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, promulgated the Regulation on
Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, which
became effective on September 8, 2006. This new regulation, among other things,
governs the approval process by which a PRC company may participate in an
acquisition of assets or equity interests. Depending on the structure of the
transaction, the new regulation will require the PRC parties to make a series of
applications and supplemental applications to the government agencies. In some
instances, the application process may require the presentation of economic data
concerning a transaction, including appraisals of the target business and
evaluations of the acquirer, which are designed to allow the government to
assess the transaction. Government approvals will have expiration dates by which
a transaction must be completed and reported to the government agencies.
Compliance with the new regulations is likely to be more time consuming and
expensive than in the past and the government can now exert more control over
the combination of two businesses. Accordingly, due to the new regulation, our
ability to engage in business combination transactions has become significantly
more complicated, time consuming and expensive, and we may not be able to
negotiate a transaction that is acceptable to our stockholders or sufficiently
protect their interests in a transaction. </P>
<P align=justify>The new regulation allows PRC government agencies to assess the
economic terms of a business combination transaction. Parties to a business
combination transaction may have to submit to the PRC Ministry of Commerce, or
MOFCOM, and other relevant government agencies an appraisal report, an
evaluation report and the acquisition agreement, all of which form part of the
application for approval, depending on the structure of the transaction. The
regulations also prohibit a transaction at an acquisition price obviously lower
than the appraised value of the PRC business or assets and in certain
transaction structures, require that consideration must be paid within defined
periods, generally not in excess of a year. The regulation also limits our
ability to negotiate various terms of the acquisition, including aspects of the
initial consideration, contingent consideration, holdback provisions,
indemnification provisions and provisions relating to the assumption and
allocation of assets and liabilities. Transaction structures involving trusts,
nominees and similar entities are prohibited. Therefore, such regulation may
impede our ability to negotiate and complete a business combination transaction
on financial terms that satisfy our investors and protect our stockholders&#146;
economic interests. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Under the New Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be
classified as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; of China. Such classification will likely
result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC
stockholders.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The EIT Law and its implementing rules became effective on
January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China
with &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; within China is considered a &#147;resident
enterprise,&#148; meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese
enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT
Law define de facto management as &#147;substantial and overall management and
control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and
properties&#148; of the enterprise. </P>
<P align=justify>On April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued
the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment
Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to
Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the
application of the EIT Law and its implementation non-Chinese enterprise or
group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise
incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise
or group will be classified as a &#147;non-domestically incorporated resident
enterprise&#148; if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or
perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions
are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets
and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes
are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or
senior management often resident in China. A resident enterprise would be
subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must
pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC
shareholders. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Notice is applicable
to an offshore enterprise incorporated by a Chinese natural person. Nor are
detailed measures on imposition of tax from non-domestically incorporated
resident enterprises are available. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities
will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.</P>

tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise
income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such
as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source income would be subject
to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the EIT
Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries
would qualify as &#147;tax-exempt income,&#148; we cannot guarantee that such dividends
will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange
control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued
guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that
are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes.
Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new
&#147;resident enterprise&#148; classification could result in a situation in which a 10%
withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC stockholders and
with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC stockholders from transferring our
shares. We are actively monitoring the possibility of &#147;resident enterprise&#148;
treatment for the 2011 tax year and are evaluating appropriate organizational
changes to avoid this treatment, to the extent possible.</P>
<P align=justify>If we were treated as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; by PRC tax
authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our
PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We face uncertainty from China&#146;s Circular on
Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Non-Resident
Enterprises' Share Transfer that was released in December 2009 with retroactive
effect from January 1, 2008.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The Chinese State Administration of Taxation, or SAT, released
a circular on December 15, 2009 that addresses the transfer of shares by
nonresident companies, generally referred to as Circular 698. Circular 698,
which is effective retroactively to January 1, 2008, may have a significant
impact on many companies that use offshore holding companies to invest in China.
Circular 698, which provides parties with a short period of time to comply with
its requirements, indirectly taxes foreign companies on gains derived from the
indirect sale of a Chinese company. Where a foreign investor indirectly
transfers equity interests in a Chinese resident enterprise by selling the
shares in an offshore holding company, and the latter is located in a country or
jurisdiction where the effective tax burden is less than 12.5% or where the
offshore income of his, her, or its residents is not taxable, the foreign
investor is required to provide the tax authority in charge of that Chinese
resident enterprise with the relevant information within 30 days of the
transfers. Moreover, where a foreign investor indirectly transfers equity
interests in a Chinese resident enterprise through an abuse of form of
organization and there are no reasonable commercial purposes such that the
corporate income tax liability is avoided, the PRC tax authority will have the
power to re-assess the nature of the equity transfer in accordance with PRC&#146;s
&#147;substance-over-form&#148; principle and deny the existence of the offshore holding
company that is used for tax planning purposes. There is uncertainty as to the
application of Circular 698. For example, while the term &#147;indirectly transfer&#148;
is not defined, it is understood that the relevant PRC tax authorities have
jurisdiction regarding requests for information over a wide range of foreign
entities having no direct contact with China. Moreover, the relevant authority
has not yet promulgated any formal provisions or formally declared or stated how
to calculate the effective tax in the country or jurisdiction and to what extent
and the process of the disclosure to the tax authority in charge of that Chinese
resident enterprise. In addition, there are not any formal declarations with
regard to how to decide &#147;abuse of form of organization&#148; and &#147;reasonable
commercial purpose,&#148; which can be utilized by us to balance if our Company
complies with the Circular 698. As a result, we may become at risk of being
taxed under Circular 698 and we may be required to expend valuable resources to
comply with Circular 698 or to establish that we should not be taxed under
Circular 698, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination
that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our
business.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA,
and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign
governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and
issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business. We have operations, agreements with third parties, and make most of
our sales in China. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government
officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or
offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors
of our Company, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is
our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our
employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may
prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents,
or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held
responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result
in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other
liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and
financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our
Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in
which we invest or that we acquire. </P>

<p align="justify">If we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny,
criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may
have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which

in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be
addressed and resolved favorably.</b></i></font> </p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p align="justify">Recently, U.S. public companies that have substantially all
of their operations in China, particularly companies like us which have
completed so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of
intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial
commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny,
criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting
irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over
financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of
adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the
scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many
U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases,
has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to
shareholder lawsuits, SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and
external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this
sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our company,
our business and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable
allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will
have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or
defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and
distract our management from growing our company. If such allegations are not
proven to be groundless, our company and business operations will be severely
and your investment in our stock could be rendered worthless.</font> </p>

<P align=justify><B>RISKS RELATED TO THE MARKET FOR OUR STOCK</B></P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Although publicly traded, the trading market in our
common stock has been substantially less liquid than the average trading market
for a stock quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market and this low trading volume may
adversely affect the price of our common stock. </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Our common stock started trading on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market under the symbol &#147;CBPO&#148; on December 7, 2009. The trading market in our
common stock has been substantially less liquid than the average trading market
for companies trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Reported average daily trading
volume in our common stock for the three months immediately prior to March 1,
2011, was approximately 0.1 million shares. Limited trading volume will subject
our shares of common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult
for you to sell your shares of common stock at a price that is attractive to
you. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>The market price of our common stock is volatile, leading
to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when you want to sell
your holdings.</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The market price of our common stock is volatile, and this
volatility may continue. Numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,
may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. These
factors include:</P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>our earnings releases, actual or anticipated changes in our earnings,
  fluctuations in our operating results or our failure to meet the expectations
  of financial market analysts and investors;
  <LI>changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who
  might cover our stock;
  <LI>speculation about our business in the press or the investment community;
  <LI>significant developments relating to our relationships with our customers
  or suppliers;
  <LI>stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded
  companies and, in particular, those that are in the our industry;
  <LI>customer demand for our products;
  <LI>investor perceptions of the our industry in general and our company in
  particular;
  <LI>the operating and stock performance of comparable companies;
  <LI>general economic conditions and trends;
  <LI>major catastrophic events;
  <LI>announcements by us or our competitors of new products, significant
  acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;
  <LI>changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretation or
  principles;
  <LI>loss of external funding sources;
  <LI>sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors, officers or
  significant stockholders; and
  <LI>additions or departures of key personnel. </LI></UL>
<P align=justify>Securities class action litigation is often instituted against
companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of
litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our management&#146;s
attention and resources. Moreover, securities markets may from time to time
experience significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to
operating performance of particular companies. For example, in July 2008, the
securities markets in the United States, China and other jurisdictions
experienced the largest decline in share prices since September 2001. These
market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other
interests in our company at a time when you want to sell your interest in
us.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws
or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our
company or changes in our management and, therefore depress the trading price of
the common stock. </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Delaware corporate law and our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in
control of our Company or changes in its management that our stockholders may
deem advantageous. These provisions: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <P>deny holders of our common stock cumulative voting rights in the election
  of directors, meaning that stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding
  shares of common stock will be able to elect all of our directors; and </P>
  <LI>
  <P>allow any vacancy on the board of directors, however the vacancy occurs, to
  be filled by the directors. </P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify>In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law generally limits our ability to engage in any business combination with
certain persons who own 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of
our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned
15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may have the
effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity
to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices.
This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of
our common stock. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable

<P align=justify>For the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to
finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate
paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be
prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn
an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends
should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the

<P align=justify>We have no outstanding or unresolved comments from the SEC

<P align=justify><B>ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. </B></P>
<P align=justify>All land in China is owned by the government. Individuals and
companies are permitted to acquire land use rights for specific purposes.
Industrial land use rights are granted for a period of 50 years. This period may
be renewed at the expiration of the initial and any subsequent terms. Granted
land use rights are transferable and may be used as security for borrowings and
other obligations. </P>
<P align=justify>In July 2003, Shandong Taibang obtained certain land use rights
from the PRC municipal government to 43,663 square meters consisting of
manufacturing facilities, warehouses and office buildings in Tai'an City,
Shandong Province. Shandong Taibang is required to make payments totaling
approximately $21,063 (RMB138,848) per year to the local state-owned entity, for
the 50 year life of the rights or until the Shandong Institute completes its
privatization process. We recorded &#147;land use rights&#148; equal to &#147;other payable &#150;
land use rights&#148; totaling $333,008, $323,687 and $325,390 as of December 31,
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, determined using present value of annual
payments over 50 years. </P>
<P align=justify>Guizhou Taibang entered into a lease agreement on June 1, 2006
with a group of individuals in an area located next to its production facility
to lease and use the space for processing industrial wastes for 10 years. The
annual lease amount is approximately $1,583 (RMB 10,438). </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that all of our properties have been adequately
maintained, are generally in good condition, and are suitable and adequate for
our business. </P>
<P align=justify>Some of our properties are leased from third parties. We have
entered into formal lease agreements with two of them. The remaining leases are
on a verbal basis. In all cases, the lessors have not been able to provide
copies of documentation evidencing their rights to use the leased property. In
most cases, the leased properties are small operating spaces we leased for our
sales offices in different parts of China. In the event of any future dispute
over the ownership of the leased properties, we believe we could easily and
quickly find replacement premises so that the operations would not be
affected.</P>
<P align=justify><B>ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.</B></P>
<P align=justify>From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits
and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these,
or other matters, may arise from time to time that may harm our business. Other
than the legal proceedings set forth below, we are currently not aware of any
such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse
affect on our business, financial condition or operating results. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Bobai County Collection Station</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In January 2007, the Company's PRC subsidiary, Shandong
Taibang, advanced approximately $455,100 (RMB3.0 million) to Feng Lin, the 20%
minority shareholder in Fang Cheng Plasma Company, the Company's majority owned
subsidiary, for the purpose of establishing or acquiring a plasma collection
station. Mr. Lin and Shandong Taibang intended to establish the Bobai Kangan
Plasma Collection Co., Ltd. (&#147;Bobai&#148;) in Bobai County, Guangxi and on January
18, 2007, Shandong Taibang signed a letter of intent to acquire the assets of
the Bobai Plasma Collection Station, which was co-owned by Mr. Lin and Mr.
Keliang Huang. However, in January 2007, Hua Lan Biological Engineering Co.,
Ltd., or Hua Lan, filed suit in the District Court of Hong Qi District, Xin
Xiang City, Henan Province, alleging that Feng Lin, Keliang Huang and Shandong
Taibang established and/or sought to operate the Bobai Plasma Collection Station
using a permit for collecting and supplying human plasma in Bobai County, that
was originally granted to Hua Lan by the government of the Guangxi region,
without Hua Lan's permission. The establishment and registration of Bobai was
never realized as a result of this law suit. On January 29, 2007, on Hua Lan's
motion, the District Court entered an order to freeze funds in the amount of
approximately $455,100 (RMB3,000,000) held by the defendants in the case,
including approximately $75,850 (RMB500,000) in funds held in Shandong Taibang's
bank account in Tai'an City. A hearing was held on June 25, 2007 and judgment
was entered against the defendants along with a $257,890 (RMB1,700,000) joint
financial judgment. The Company appealed the District Court judgment to the
Xinxiang City Intermediate Court. In November 2007, the Intermediate Court
affirmed the judgment against the three defendants and increased the amount of
the joint financial judgment to approximately $455,100 (RMB3,000,000). </P>

<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_33></A>
<P align=justify>In January 2008, Hua Lan enforced the judgment granted by the
Intermediate Court to freeze the Company's bank accounts. Shandong Taibang has
filed a separate action against Hua Lan before the Tai'an City District Court to
seek recovery of any losses in connection with Hua Lan's claim and to request
that the Tai'an City District Court preserve Hua Lan's property or freeze up to
approximately $455,100 (RMB 3 million) of Hua Lan's assets to secure the return
of such funds to the Company. The intermediate court in Tai'an City accepted the
application on February 14, 2008 but the matter is still pending. Pending the
outcome of the proceedings, Shandong Taibang increased its loss contingency
reserve during its fourth quarter of 2007 from approximately $85,963
(RMB566,667) to $151,700 (RMB1,000,000) to cover its share of the enforcement of
this judgment. During the fourth quarter of 2008, full amount of the judgment,
including Feng Lin and Keliang Huang's portions of the judgment and the related
fees, approximately $471,772 (RMB 3,109,900) has been withdrawn from Shandong
Taibang's account. The Company recorded Feng Lin and Keliang Huang's portion of
the judgment, approximately $314,510 (RMB 2,073,234), as receivable as a result
of the withdrawal. As of December 31, 2008, the Company determined that it is
unlikely that the Company will be able to recover such receivable from those two
individuals and wrote off the receivable as bad debt expense. In January 2010,
Feng Lin transferred his 20% equity in Fang Cheng Plasma Company as a repayment
to such receivable. As a result, the Company is now the 100% owner of the Fang
Cheng Plasma Company.</P>
<P align=justify>In October 2009, Shandong Taibang appealed to the High Court of
Henan Province requesting the court to reverse judgments from the Hong Qi
District Court based on Shandong Taibang's belief that Hua Lan&#146;s involvement in
Bobai was in violation of PRC Blood Products Regulations as Hua Lan did not
invest, as Shandong Taibang did, in Bobai as required by the Regulation. The
Company was awaiting the judgment of the Henan High Court as of the date of this
report. In light of the foregoing, it is unlikely that the Company's planned
acquisition of the assets of Bobai will go forward. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Dispute among Guizhou Taibang Shareholders over Raising
Additional Capital</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>On May 28, 2007, a 91% majority of Guizhou Taibang's
shareholders approved a plan to raise additional capital from private strategic
investors through the issuance of an additional 20,000,000 shares of Guizhou
Taibang equity interests at RMB 2.80 per share. The plan required all existing
Guizhou Taibang shareholders to waive their rights of first refusal to subscribe
for the additional shares. The remaining 9% minority holder of Guizhou Taibang's
shares, the Guizhou Jie'an Company, or Jie'an, did not support the plan and did
not agree to waive its right of first refusal. On May 29, 2007, the majority
shareholders caused Guizhou Taibang to sign an Equity Purchase Agreement with
certain investors, pursuant to which the investors agreed to invest an aggregate
of RMB 50,960,000 (approximately $7,730,632) in exchange for 18,200,000 shares,
or 21.4%, of Guizhou Taibang's equity interests. At the same time, Jie'an also
subscribed for 1,800,000 shares, representing its 9% pro rata share of the
20,000,000 shares being offered. The proceeds from all parties were received by
Guizhou Taibang in accordance with the agreement. </P>
<P align=justify>In June 2007, Jie'an brought suit in the High Court of Guizhou
province, China, against Guizhou Taibang and the three other original Guizhou
Taibang shareholders, alleging the illegality of the Equity Purchase Agreement.
In its complaint, Jie'an alleged that it had a right to acquire the shares
waived by the original Guizhou Taibang shareholders and offered to the investors
in connection with the Equity Purchase Agreement. On September 12, 2008, the
Guizhou High Court ruled against Jie'an and sustained the Equity Purchase
Agreement, but on November 2008, Jie'an appealed the Guizhou High Court judgment
to the People's Supreme Court in Beijing. On May 13, 2009, the People's Supreme
Court sustained the original ruling and denied the rights of first refusal of
Jie'an over the additional shares waived by the original Guizhou Taibang's
shareholders. The registration of the new investors as Guizhou Taibang's
shareholders and the related increase in registered capital of Guizhou Taibang
with the Administration for Industry and Commerce are still pending. On January
27, 2010, the strategic investors brought suit in the High Court of Guizhou
Province against Guizhou Taibang alleging Guizhou Taibang&#146;s failure to register
their equity interest in Guizhou Taibang with the local AIC and requesting the
distribution of their share of Guizhou Taibang&#146;s dividends. Dalin was also
joined as a co-defendant as it is the majority shareholder and exercises control
over Guizhou Taibang&#146;s day-to-day operations. The Company does not expect the
strategic investors to prevail because, upon evaluation of the Equity Purchase
Agreement, the Company believes that the Equity Purchase Agreement is void due
to certain invalid pre-conditions and the absence of shareholder authorization
of the initial investment. In the event that Guizhou Taibang is required to
return their original investment amount to the strategic investors, as of
December 31, 2010, Guizhou Taibang has set aside the strategic investors&#146; fund
along with RMB 10,056,242 (approximately $1,525,532) in accrued interests, and
RMB 509,600 (approximately $77,306) for the 1% penalty imposed by the agreement
for any breach. If strategic investors prevail in their suit, Dalin's interests
in Guizhou Taibang may be reduced to approximately 41.3%. The High Court of Guizhou heard the case on April 8, 2010 and encouraged, and accepted by both
parties, to settle the dispute outside the court but both parties failed to
reach a mutual agreeable term. </P>
<P align=justify>On October 14, 2010, the High Court of Guizhou ruled in favor
of the Company and denied the strategic investors&#146; right as shareholders of
Guizhou Taibang, as well as their entitlement to the dividends. On October 26,
2010, the strategic investors appealed to, and subsequently accepted by, the PRC
Superior Court in Beijing on the ruling. As of the date of this report, the
Company is waiting to hear the ruling from the Court. In light of the Guizhou
ruling, in November 2010 the Company returned the proceeds in the amount of RMB
11,200,000 (approximately $1,699,040) to one of the strategic investors. </P>

<P align=justify>During the second quarter of 2010, Jie&#146;an requested that
Guizhou Taibang register its 1.8 million shares of additional capital infusion
with the local AIC, pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, and such request
was approved by the majority shareholders of Guizhou Taibang in a shareholders
meeting held in the second quarter of 2010. However, the Board of Directors of
the Company is withholding its required ratification of the shareholders&#146;
approval of Jie&#146;an&#146;s request, pending the outcome of the ongoing litigation. If
the Company decides to ratify the approval, Dalin&#146;s ownership in Guizhou Taibang
will be diluted from 54% to 52.54% and Jie&#146;an may be entitled to receive its pro

<P align=justify><B><I>Dispute over Guizhou Taibang Technical Consulting
Agreement</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In 1997, Guizhou Taibang entered into a Technical Cooperation
Agreement with Sin Kyung Ye, or Sin, a Korean individual, to provide certain
fractionation equipment and transfer processing know-how to Guizhou Taibang. In
August 2004, Sin filed a law suit against Guizhou Taibang with the Intermediate
Court in Guiyang City, China, alleging non-payment of RMB 100,000
(approximately, $15,170) for his fractionation equipment and RMB 5,000,000
(approximately, $758,500) for the transfer of his technological know-how. The
Intermediate Court ruled in favor of Sin and found that Guizhou Taibang owed Sin
RMB 10,376,160 (approximately, $ 1,574,063), but Guizhou Taibang appealed the
Intermediate Court ruling to the Guizhou High Court. The Guizhou High Court
agreed in part with Guizhou Taibang's grounds for appeal and reduced the amount
of know-how transfer fee to RMB 1,970,413 (approximately, $298,912). In May
2007, Sin appealed the Guizhou High Court's decision to the People's Supreme
Court in Beijing. The People's Supreme Court heard in April 2008 and ruled on
December 29, 2009 for Guizhou Taibang pay RMB 4,700,000 (approximately,
$712,990) as compensation to Sin for technology transfer and RMB 100,000
(approximately, $15,170) for unpaid equipment purchase. In December 2010, Sin
filed another law suit against Guizhou Taibang with the Guizhou High Court for
additional compensation of RMB5,376,160 (approximately $815,563). The Guizhou
High Court ruled in favor of Sin on December 7, 2010 for Guizhou Taibang to pay
the additional compensation. Guizhou Taibang has accrued and accounted for all
these expenses as of December 31, 2010 and subsequently paid the judgment in
full as of the date of this report. In January 2011, Sin appealed to the Guizhou
High Court again for interest due to the late payment of the technology transfer
fee since 2002. On March 16, the Company settled with Sin in court to pay RMB
752,834 (approximately $114,205) as interest for the delay in payment since 2002
and both parties also agreed not to appeal further.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Guizhou Taibang's Guarantee to a Third Party</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In 2007, as a condition to purchase Huang Ping Plasma Station,
Guizhou Taibang entered into an agreement with the Guizhou Zhongxin Investment
Company, or Zhongxin, in which Guizhou Taibang agreed to repay Zhongxin's debt
out of Guizhou Taibang's payables to Zhongxin arising from plasma purchased from
Zhongxin. In the same agreement, Guizhou Taibang also delivered a guarantee to
the Huang Ping County Hospital, the former co-owner of the Huang Ping Plasma
Station, that it would pay RMB3,074,342 (approximately, $466,378) in debt that
Zhongxin owed to the hospital. On June 1, 2009, the Huang Ping Hospital brought
suit, in the Huang Ping County People's Court of Guizhou Province, against
Zhongxin for non-payment of its payables and debt due to Huang Ping Hospital and
against Guizhou Taibang as the guarantor. On November 2, 2009, the court ruled
in favor of the plaintiff and Guizhou Taibang as the guarantor became obligated
to repay the Zhongxin&#146;s debt to the Huang Ping Hospital on behalf of Zhongxin.
In October 2009, Guizhou Taibang appealed to the Middle Court of Kaili District
in Guizhou Province which sustained the original judgment on April 8, 2010.
Under the Equity Transfer Agreement pursuant to which we acquired a 90% interest
in Dalin, Guizhou Taibang's majority shareholder, provides that the sellers will
be responsible, based on their pro rata equity interest in Guizhou Taibang, for
damages incurred by Guizhou Taibang from Zhongxin's debt and that they will
repay Dalin their pro rata share of payments made by Guizhou Taibang to
creditors in connection with Zhongxin's debt within 10 days after payment by
Guizhou Taibang. The RMB 3,074,342 contingent liability and proportionate share
of the liability to be recovered from the sellers were properly reflected in the
financials as of December 31, 2009. On December 31, 2010, Guizhou Taibang
brought suit against Zhongxin in the Middle Court of Guiyang City, to recover
the full judgment amount of RMB 3,074,342 plus court fee of RMB 32,340 that
Guizhou Taibang has already paid on behalf of Zhongxin. </P>
<P align=justify>On September 13, 2010, Zhongxin countersued the Company for a
consideration of RMB 500,000 (approximately $75,850) for the alleged loss of its
share of income from the Huang Ping Plasma Station since the Company acquired
the station in April 2007. The Company believes Zhongxin&#146;s claim is unwarranted
since the Company acquired the station from its rightful owner, the Treasury
Department of Huangpin County, Guizhou Province.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Shandong Taibang Equity Interests</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Mr. Zu Ying Du was one of the original equity holders in the
Company&#146;s operating subsidiary, Shandong Taibang. Pursuant to a joint venture
agreement, among the original equity holders, Mr. Du was obligated to make a
capital contribution of RMB 20 million (or approximately $3.0 million) for a 25%
interest in Shandong Taibang. Mr. Du made this contribution using funds borrowed
from the Beijing Chen Da Technology Investment Company, or Beijing Chen Da. Mr.
Du failed to repay Beijing Chen Da for his loan of the capital contribution
amount. Mr. Du disputes that the money was due and owing. A Beijing court found
that Beijing Chen Da had given money to Mr. Du but found that the loan agreement
failed to comply with Chinese law. A notice was issued on July 5, 2004 by the
Shenzhen Public Security Bureau Economic Crime Investigation Unit requesting a
stay of the Beijing action pending their investigation into money laundering
relating to the 20 million RMB loan to Zu Ying Du.</P>

<P align=justify>Subsequently, Beijing Chen Da entered into an equity transfer
agreement with Mr. Du, pursuant to which Mr. Du's 25% equity interest in
Shandong Taibang was transferred to Beijing Chen Da as repayment of the RMB 20
million debt. This agreement was signed by Mr. Du's brother who held a power of
attorney from Mr. Du. Mr. Du disputes the legitimacy of this transfer and has
argued that his brother, Du Hai Shan, exceeded the scope of the power of
attorney. Mr. Du sued his brother in the court of Jianli County, Hubei province,
relating to the propriety of the brother's actions under the power of attorney.
Initially the county court found in its judgment that the act had exceeded the
scope of the power of attorney. Subsequently the Intermediate Court of Jingzhou
City, Hubei province, ruled on December 10, 2008 to suspend the judgment based
on the grounds that the original court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The
case is slated to be reviewed again by the Hubei Jingzhou Intermediate
Court.</P>
<P align=justify>Missile Engineering, another original equity holder wholly
controlled by Mr. Du, was obligated to contribute RMB 32.8 million (or $5.0
million) for a 41% interest in Shandong Taibang by means of cash, equipment and
patent technology. It was obligated to obtain new drug certificate and
production license of its patent technology from the government within a
stipulated period in order to be recognized as a valid capital contribution, or
in the alternative, make a cash payment. The patent technology was valued as RMB
26.4 million (or approximately $4.0 million). However, Missile Engineering
failed to obtain the new drug certificate and production license within the
stipulated period. Mr. Du also disputes whether the period for obtaining the
certificate and license had expired. Pursuant to a stockholders resolution on
September 26, 2004, Missile Engineering agreed to sell its 41% interest in
Shandong Taibang to Up-Wing and Up-Wing agreed to take up the obligation of
Missile Engineering to pay the RMB 26.4 million in cash. Missile Engineering
disputes this transaction and sued the brother of Mr. Du in the court of Jianli
County, Hubei province, relating to the propriety of the brother's actions under
the power of attorney. Initially the county court found in its judgment that the
act had exceeded the scope of the power of attorney. Subsequently the
Intermediate Court of Jingzhou City, Hubei province, ruled on December 10, 2008
to suspend the judgment based on the grounds that the original court lacked
jurisdiction to hear the case. The case is slated to be reviewed again by the
Hubei Jingzhou Intermediate Court.</P>
<P align=justify>In June 10, 2005, Beijing Chen Da also sold its equity interest
in Shandong Taibang to Up-Wing Investments Limited, or Up-Wing, pursuant to a
share transfer agreement, which became effective on September 2, 2005, upon
approval by the Shandong Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC. In March 2006, Up-Wing sold its equity
interests in Shandong Taibang to Logic Express, the Company&#146;s subsidiary.</P>
<P align=justify>In 2006, Missile Engineering applied for arbitration before the
China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, or CIETAC, to
challenge the effectiveness of the transfer to Up-Wing Investments Limited, of
the equity interests in Shandong Taibang formerly owned by Missile Engineering.
The equity transfer had been approved by the Shandong Provincial Department of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC. Missile
Engineering later voluntarily withdrew this application and instead applied for
administrative reconsideration of the equity transfer, but this application was
rejected by the Ministry of Commerce in 2007. Missile Engineering applied with
the District Court of Lixia District, Jinan City, Shandong province requesting
revocation of Shandong COFTEC's approval of the equity transfer to Up-wing by
Missile Engineering. Missile Engineering later voluntarily withdrew the action.
In April 2007, Logic Express initiated an arbitration proceeding before the
Shandong Tai'an Arbitration Committee, to establish that Logic Express is the
lawful shareholder of Shandong Taibang. The parties to that proceeding were
Logic Express Ltd. and Shandong Taibang Biological Products Co., Ltd. The
Arbitration Committee's decision on September 6, 2007 confirmed that Logic
Express had legitimate ownership as a result of the transfer of Shandong
Taibang. Up-Wing started an action in the Intermediate Court of Tai'an City,
Shandong province requesting the court to establish that Up-Wing is the lawful
shareholder of Shandong Taibang. The Intermediate Court of Tai'an City, Shandong
province on December 20, 2007 rejected the application on the basis that the
same matter had been tried by the arbitration panel.</P>
<P align=justify>Up-Wing filed a defamation case in the District Court of
Hi-technology and Industry Development District, Tai'an City, Shandong province
claiming defamation against Mr. Du and the 21<SUP>st </SUP>Century Economic
Report Newspaper. Judgment in favor of Up-Wing was rendered on July 22, 2008
ordering the newspaper and Mr. Du to publish an apology to Up-Wing.</P>
<P align=justify>Mr. Du and Missile Engineering subsequently filed two actions
in the Intermediate Court of Wuhan City, Hubei province, against Du Hai Shan,
his brother, Beijing Chen Da and Logic Express, requesting that the court
restore the equity interests originally held by the plaintiffs, 25% equity
interest held by Mr. Du and 41% equity interest held by Missile Engineering and
the court issued a preliminary order attaching 66% of the equity of Shandong
Taibang pending the outcome of the case. On September 25, 2009, the Higher
People's Court of Hubei overruled the Wuhan Intermediate Court's acceptance of
jurisdiction over the case and ruled that the Tai'an Intermediate Court in
Shandong Province, where the Company is located, had the proper jurisdiction
over the parties' dispute. The court ruled that while the plaintiffs had the
right to bring a lawsuit for the validity of the share transfer agreement
because they did not attend the previous arbitration hearing and never reached
an arbitration agreement regarding their dispute, the Tai'an Intermediate Court
has the proper jurisdiction over the dispute pursuant to the prior agreement of
the parties. As a result, the attached 66% of the equity of Shandong Taibang was
released. On November 17, 2009, the Wuhan Intermediate Court permitted Mr. Du
and Missile Engineering to withdraw their suits against Logic Express and the
other defendants. </P>

<P align=justify>On September 28, 2010, the Company received a Notice from the
PRC Supreme Court, advising the Company that the PRC Supreme Court has accepted
an appeal for judicial review of the Hubei High Court ruling dismissing case. On
November 2, 2010, the Company submitted its counter-argument and related
materials to the PRC Supreme Court and the PRC Supreme Court ruled in favor of
the Company on November 30, 2010 and denied Mr. Du and Missile Engineering&#146;s
appeal to the ruling of the Wuhan Intermediate Court. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Dispute over Raw Plasma Supply Agreement with
Xintai</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>On March 10, 2009, Henan Xintai Medicine Company (previously
known as Henan Zhongtai Medicine, &#147;Xintai&#148;) brought suit against Shandong
Taibang and its two wholly-owned plasma collecting subsidiaries in Shandong for
breach of a raw plasma supply agreement. The suit was subsequently withdrawn by
Xintai on May 31, 2009. The agreement, signed by Shandong Taibang and Xintai on
October 10, 2006, requires the two subsidiaries to provide to Xintai 45 metric
tons of raw plasma per year from 2007 to 2009. The subsidiaries provided more
than 34 metric tons of plasma to Xintai during 2007. However, the Company ceased
its delivery of plasma to Xintai in late 2007 to avoid contravention of new PRC
regulation. Clause 43 of an October 31, 2007, PRC State Department Regulation on
Plasma Collection Stations, prohibits plasma collecting stations from providing
raw plasma to any manufacturer other than their direct parent (the
&#147;Regulation&#148;). On March 12, 2009, Shandong Taibang filed a suit in the Shandong
Tai'an Middle Court against Xintai seeking damages of RMB50,000 (approximately,
$7,585) for the plasma already supplied to Xintai during 2007. On June 29, 2009,
Xintai re-filed its suit in the Shandong Tai'an Middle Court against Shandong
Taibang and the two subsidiaries seeking compensation of RMB6,000,000
(approximately, $910,200) for alleged breach of contract and demanding that
Shandong Taibang and the subsidiaries continue to honor the agreement. On
October 20, 2009, the Tai'an Middle Court combined and heard the two suits and
ruled on January 20, 2010 in favor of Shandong Taibang on all accounts.</P>
<P align=justify>On February 17, 2010, Xintai appealed to the High Court of
Shandong Province and on August 10, 2010, the High Court remanded the suit to
the Tai&#146;an Middle Court for retrial on grounds of insufficient evidence. </P>
<P align=justify>On November 8, 2010, the Company and Xintai reached an out of
court settlement whereby Shandong Taibang agreed to pay Xintai RMB 4,000,000
(approximately $606,800), payable on or before November 22, 2010, and RMB 43,950
(approximately $6,667) in court costs. The Company has paid the costs of its
settlement agreement with Xintai under legal expenses as of December 31,
2010.</P>

<P align=justify><B>Overview</B></P>
<P align=justify>We are a biopharmaceutical company and through our indirect
majority-owned PRC subsidiaries, Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang, and our
minority-owned PRC investee, Huitian, we are principally engaged in the
research, development, manufacturing and sales of plasma-based pharmaceutical
products in China. Shandong Taibang operates from our manufacturing facility
located in Tai&#146;an, Shandong Province and Guizhou Taibang operates from our
manufacturing facility located in Guiyang City, Guizhou Province. Our minority
owned investee, Huitian, operates from its facility in Shaanxi Province. The
plasma-based biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China is highly
regulated by both the provincial and central governments. Accordingly, the
manufacturing process of our products is strictly monitored from the initial
collection of plasma from human donors to finished products. Our principal
products include our approved human albumin and immunoglobulin products. </P>
<P align=justify>We are approved to sell human albumin 20%/10ml, 20%/25ml,
20%/50ml, 10%/10ml, 10%/25ml, 10%/50ml and 25%/50ml. Human albumin is our
top-selling product. Sales of these human albumin products represented
approximately 47.8%, 49.5% and 57.8% of our total revenues, respectively, for
the each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Human albumin is
principally used to increase blood volume while immunoglobulin, one of our other
major products, is used for certain disease preventions and cures. The Company&#146;s
approved human albumin and immunoglobulin products use human plasma as the basic
raw material. Albumin has been used for almost 50 years to treat critically ill
patients by replacing lost fluid and maintaining adequate blood volume and
pressure. All of our products are prescription medicines administered in the
form of injections. </P>
<P align=justify>We sell our products to customers in the PRC, mainly hospitals
and inoculation centers directly or through approved distributors. Our sales
have historically been made on the basis of short-term arrangements and our
largest customers have changed over the years. For the years ended December 31,
2010, 2009 and 2008, our top 5 customers accounted for approximately 12.3%,
10.7% and 16.2%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008, our largest customer accounted for approximately 2.8%, 4.0% and 6.4%, of
our revenue, respectively. As we continue to diversify our geographic presence,
customer base and product mix, we expect that our largest customers will
continue to change from year to year. </P>

<P align=justify><B>2010 Financial Performance Highlights</B></P>
<P align=justify>We continued to experience strong demand for our products and
services during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, which resulted in
revenue and net income growth. The following are some financial highlights for
the year: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">

<P align=justify><B>Principal Factors Affecting our Financial
Performance</B></P>
<P align=justify>The following are key factors that affect our financial
condition and results of operations and we believe them to be important to the
understanding of our business: </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Raw Material Supply and Prices</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>The primary raw material used in the production of our albumin
and immunoglobulin products is human plasma. Collection of human plasma in China
is regulated and, until 2006, only licensed Plasmapheresis stations owned and
operated by the government could collect human plasma. Each collection station
was only allowed to supply plasma to the one manufacturer that has signed the
&#147;Quality Responsibility&#148; statement with them. The price of human plasma is
negotiated on an annual basis and is determined by a number of factors
including, but not limited to, the cost of operating the collection stations,
the nutritional supplement fee awarded to the donors for each donation, and the
anticipated volume of total plasma donated. However, in March 2006, the Ministry
of Health promulgated certain &#147;Measures on Reforming Plasma Collection
Stations,&#148; or the Blood Collection Measures, whereby the ownership and
management of PRC plasma stations are required to be transferred to plasma-based
biopharmaceutical companies while the regulatory supervision and administrative
control remain with the State. Plasma stations that did not complete their
reform by December 31, 2006, risked revocation of their license to collect
plasma. </P>
<P align=justify>In December 2006, we acquired five of the six then existing
plasma stations in Shandong and on January 1, 2007 we obtained the permits to
operate these stations. These acquisitions have allowed us to have a direct
influence on the operation of these collection stations and secure a stable
source of plasma supply for production. The foregoing acquisitions, as well as
the acquisition of Dalin and its indirectly owned plasma stations, have led to
an increase in our plasma supply for production and did not result in any
material differences in our cost structure. Due to current market conditions, we
have generally been able to pass substantially all cost increases in recent
years on to our customers.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Prices of and Demand for Our Products</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In recent years, due to increased regulatory restrictions and
market demand, we have been able to increase the selling price of most of our
key products. The demand for our products is largely affected by the general
economic conditions in China because they are still not affordable to many
patients. As China's economy grows, we expect more Chinese people will become
consumers of medical treatments and procedures, including procedures requiring
human plasma. A significant improvement in the economic environment in China
will likely improve consumer income which in turn would make our products more
affordable and consequently increase the demand for our products. We have been
able to expand our product range and markets by introducing new products
required by customers. We believe that our technical expertise is important in
introducing products that are in demand. </P>

<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_39></A>
<P align=justify><B><I>Production Capacity</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Our sales volume is limited by our annual production capacity.
As we grow our business in the future, our ability to fulfill additional and
larger orders will depend on our ability to increase our production capacity.
Our plan to expand our production capacity will depend on, inter alia, the
availability of capital to meet our needs of expansion or upgrading of
production lines, and the availability of stable plasma supply. </P>
<P align=justify>As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate production capacity of
Shandong Taibang and Guizhou Taibang was 1,100 metric tons per annum. We
estimate that the production capacity of our major competitors ranges from 300
tons to 1,000 tons per annum. We believe that our current production capacity is
sufficient to meet the current demand for our products for the next two years.
</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Competition</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We are subject to intense competition. There are both local and
overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale
of potential substitute or similar biopharmaceutical products as our products in
the PRC. These competitors may have more capital, better research and
development resources, manufacturing and marketing capability and experience
than we do. In our industry, we compete based upon product quality, product
cost, ability to produce a diverse range of products and logistical
capabilities. </P>
<P align=justify>We believe that we have strengthened our position in the
marketplace with our acquisition of Dalin and its 54% majority-owned operating
subsidiary, Guizhou Taibang, and a 35% equity interest in Huitian, a Xi'an-based
biopharmaceutical company. </P>
<P align=justify>Our profitability may be adversely affected if (i) competition
intensifies; (ii) competitors drastically reduce prices; (iii) PRC government&#146;s
interference on prices; or (iv) competitors develop new products or product
substitutes with comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects which
are more effective or less costly than those produced by us. Please refer to
Item 1, &#147;Business - Competition&#148; for more information regarding this factor.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Taxation</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>China Biologic is subject to United States tax at a tax rate of
34%. No provision for income taxes in the United States has been made as China
Biologic has no income taxable in the United States. Logic Express was
incorporated in the BVI, but is not subject to taxation in that jurisdiction.
Logic Holdings was incorporated in Hong Kong and under the current laws of Hong
Kong, are subject to a Profits Tax of 16.5%. However, no provision for Hong
Kong Profits Tax has been made as Logic Holdings has no taxable income.</P>
<P align=justify>According to the PRC's central government policy, new or high
technology companies will enjoy preferential tax treatment of 15%, instead of
25% under the EIT Law. On December 5, 2008, Shandong Taibang received the new
technology or high technology certification from Shandong provincial government.
The Certification allows Shandong Taibang to receive the 15% preferential income
tax rate, for a period of three years starting from January 1, 2008. Guizhou
Taibang enjoyed the preferential income tax rate of 15% also under the 10-year
Western Development Tax Concession, which started on January 2001 and ended on
December 2010. The PRC tax authority is studying the possibility of extending
the concession, especially for those industries that are encouraged by the PRC
government, such as ours. In the event that PRC tax authorities discontinue the
concession, Guizhou Taibang will apply for the new or high technology
preferential tax treatment of 15% like Shandong Taibang. See Item 1, &#147;Business &#150;
Regulation &#150; Taxation&#148; for a detailed description of the EIT Law and tax
regulations applicable to our PRC subsidiaries.</P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Sales</I></B>. Our sales are derived primarily from the
sales of human albumin and various types of immunoglobulin. Our sales increased
17.4%, or $20,697,262, to $139,695,417 for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2010, compared to sales of $118,998,155 for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2009. The increase in sales during fiscal year 2010 is primarily attributable to
a general increase in the price and volume of plasma based products. Among the
factors that contributed to the growth in revenue, foreign exchange translation
accounted for 1.1% of the increase.</P>
<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p align="justify">Most of our approved products recorded price increases
ranging from 12.6% to 186.4%, except for human albumin products, which decreased
by 1.8%. The decrease in the price of human albumin in 2010 is primarily due to
the increased volume of imported human albumin products in the PRC market during
the period. We expect that this trend may continue as long as the volume of the
imported human albumin products continue to grow. For the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2010, the average price for our approved human albumin products,
which contributed 48.0% to our total revenue, decreased 1.8%, the average price
for our approved human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection, which
contributed 34.4% to our revenue, increased 26.9%, the average price for our
approved human tetanus immunoglobulin, which contributed 2.9% to our revenue,
increased 12.6%, the average price for our approved human rabies immunoglobulin,
which contributed 5.3% to our revenue, increased 24.6%, and the average price
for our approved human hepatitis B immunoglobulin, which contributed 7.6% to our
revenue, increased 186.4%, as compared to the same period in 2009. The price
increase of our products was primarily attributable to the continuing shortage
in supply of the plasma-based products. We were able to adjust our production
plan to take advantage of the limited market supply of plasma resources to
realize higher profit margins. </p>
</font>
<P align=justify>Volume in sales for our human albumin, human hepatitis B
immunoglobulin, human rabies immunoglobulin products and human tetanus
immunoglobulin products increased by 15.7%, 7.4%, 26.5% and 24.6%, respectively,
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in
2009. Volume in sales for our human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection
decreased by 15.8%, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to
the same period in 2009, because in 2009 the market demand for human
immunoglobulin for intravenous injection increased due to the outbreak of
hand-foot-mouth disease and the price of human immunoglobulin for intravenous
injection was also much enhanced. As a result we used the large amount of Factor
II+III, the material segregated from plasma and restored separately when making
centralized production of human albumin in 2008, to produce and sell high volume
of human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection in 2009. The volume in sales
for human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection decreased to a comparatively
normal level in 2010.</P>

$4,329,241, or 13.3%, to $36,951,149 for the year ended December 31, 2010, from
$32,621,908 during the same period in 2009. Cost of sales as a percentage of
sales was 26.5% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to
27.4% during 2009. The increase in cost of sales is due to the increase in
sales, while the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales is due to a
change in the mix of products, as well as the price increase in most of the
products, that were sold during 2010.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Gross profit and gross margin</I></B>. The gross profit
increased by $16,368,021, or 18.9%, to $102,744,268 for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2010 from $86,376,247 for the same period in 2009. As a percentage
of sales revenue, our gross profit increased by 0.9% to 73.5% for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2010, from 72.6% for 2009. The increase in gross profit
is due mainly to increases in the selling price and sales volume of our products
during 2010, as compared to 2009.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Operating expenses</I></B>. Our total operating expenses
increased by $8,219,985, or 32.9%, to $33,219,040 for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2010, from $24,999,055 for 2009. The increase was primarily
attributable to a 40.5% increase in our research and development expenses, a
108.9% increase in our selling expense and an 18.7% increase in our general and
administrative expenses during 2010. As a percentage of sales revenue, total
expenses increased by 2.8% to 23.8% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010
from 21.0% for 2009. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Selling expenses</U>. For the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, our selling expenses increased to
$7,372,348, from $3,529,242 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, an
increase of $3,843,106, or 108.9%. As a percentage of sales, our selling
expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 2.3%, to 5.3%,
from 3.0% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in selling
expenses is primarily due to an increase in our promotional and conference
activities as we continue our efforts in expanding our customer base into
hospital and inoculation centers throughout the PRC.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>General and administrative
expenses</U>. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, our general and
administrative expenses increased to $23,510,566, from $19,807,123 for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, a $3,703,443, or 18.7% increase. General
and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 0.2% to 16.8%
for fiscal year 2010 from 16.6% for the fiscal year 2009. The increase in
general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the increases in legal
expense, non-cash employee compensation, travel and general office expenses as
we continue to our efforts to integrate our two main operating entities, as well
as and inventory allowance, which were offset by the decrease in payroll. The
increase in legal expense is due to the $598,114 settlement of a law suit with
Henan Xintai and the $1,177,836 settlement of a law suit with Sin Kyung Ye as
described under Item 3, Legal Proceedings. Non-cash employee compensation for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $2,279,502 to $2,341,783,
from $62,281 for 2009, as a result of the amortization of the grant of stock
options to the Company&#146;s senior management staff in the January, February and
July of 2010.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Research and development
expenses</U>. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, our
research and development expenses were $2,336,126 and $1,662,690, respectively,
an increase of $673,436, or 40.5%. As a percentage of sales, our research and
development expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were
1.7% and 1.4%, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses
is primarily due to the cost associated with the development of two new products
that are at the end of their respective development stage. We expect to receive SFDA approval for these two new products in 2011.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Change in fair value of derivative
liabilities</I></B><I>. </I>The embedded derivatives (including the conversion
option) in our senior secured convertible notes and warrants that were issued in
June 2009 are classified as derivative liabilities carried at fair value. For
the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized a loss on the
change in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $3,233,288 and
$28,915,328, respectively. The recognized loss on the change in the fair value
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 is mainly due to the Company&#146;s stock
price increase from $12.08 to $16.39, which increased the fair value of
derivative instruments, as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010,
respectively. Future changes in the market price of our common stock could cause
the fair value of these derivative financial instruments to change significantly
in future periods.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Interest expense (income), net</I></B><I>. </I>Our net
interest expense decreased $2,000,084 to $1,930,165 for the year ended December
31, 2010, from interest expense of $3,930,249 for the same period in 2009. The
decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to our payment of a related
party loan related to the acquisition of Dalin in the second quarter of 2010,
conversion of $4.9 million of our outstanding convertible notes in 2009 and 2010
and an increase in interest income from our short term deposits with financial
institutions.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Income tax expense</I></B><I>. </I>Our provision for
income taxes increased $3,595,192, or 35.9%, to $13,608,755 for the year ended
December 31, 2010, from $10,013,563 for the same period in 2009. Our effective
tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 20.7%, and our 2009 effective
tax rate was 34.7%. The decrease in effective tax rate is mainly due to the
decrease of $25.7 million in change in fair value of derivative liabilities that
is not tax deductible. Among the increase in income taxes, $1.3 million is due
to the dividend tax imposed by PRC tax authorities on dividends distributed by
our two main operating entities to Logic Express during the 2010 period.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Net income</I></B><I>. </I>Our net income increased
$33,168,520, or 176.2%, to $51,992,304 for the year ended December 31, 2010,
from $18,823,784 for the same period in 2009. Net income as a percentage of
sales was 37.2% and 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively, as a result of the foregoing factors. </P>

<P align=justify>As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of
$64,941,368, primarily consisting of cash on hand and demand deposits. To date,
we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations,
augmented by short-term bank borrowings and equity contributions by our
stockholders. We expect that cash on hand, funds generated from our operations

<P align=justify>Net cash provided by operating activities was $38.8 million for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to $50.3 million net cash
provided by operating activities for 2009. The net cash provided by operating
activities in the year ended December 31, 2010 was mainly due to the net income
of $65.4 million and offset by cash outflow for inventory and accounts
receivable of $16.0 million and $7.8 million, respectively. The cash outflow for
inventory is a direct result of the implementation of the 90-day quarantine
period by the PRC government, which caused a longer staging period for its raw
material plasma inventory. As the Company increased its sales directly to the
end-users, hospitals and inoculation centers with extended credit term, we
experienced a slower turn-over with our accounts receivable.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Investing activities</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Our use of cash for investing activities is primarily for the
acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangibles, and advances on
non-current assets. Net cash used for investing activities for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2010 was $15.9 million, as compared to $6.9 million in 2009.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, we paid $1.5 million to acquire
a new Company, Ziguang Bio-tech Company, paid the final $2.5 million payment for the
acquisition of 90% equity in Dalin, $5.3 million for equipment for Shandong
Taibang and $6.5 million for our plasma companies' buildings and construction in
progress in Guizhou Taibang.</P>

<P align=justify>Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended
December 31, 2010 totaled $14.3 million as compared to $1.6 million net cash
provided by financing activities in 2009. The increase of the cash used in
financing activities was mainly attributable to the $10.4 million dividend paid
by our subsidiaries to the noncontrolling interest holder, repayment of a non-controlling shareholder loan of
$3.7 million, repayment of short term bank loan of $7.4 million and offset by
short-term bank loans and proceeds from warrants conversion of $5.9 million and
$1.2 million, respectively. </P>
<P align=justify>Management believes that the Company has sufficient cash on
hand and continuing positive cash inflow, from the sale of its plasma-based
products in the PRC market. Our management expects continued growth in revenues
throughout the term of the convertible notes, largely due to the ongoing limited
supply of plasma-based products in the PRC market due to the introduction of
more stringent health and safety measures which we already meet. In light of the
foregoing, we believe that the Company will have the financial ability to
fulfill its payment obligations under the convertible notes when they come due.

<P align=justify><B>Critical Accounting Policies </B></P>
<P align=justify>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our
management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related
disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical
accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and
estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the
following:</P>
<P align=justify><U>Use of Estimates </U></P>
<P align=justify>The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items
subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of fixed
assets; the allowance for doubtful accounts; the fair value determinations of
financial and equity instruments and stock compensation awards, assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in a business combination; the realizability of deferred
tax assets and inventories; the recoverability of goodwill, intangible asset, land use right and property, plant and
equipment; and accruals for income tax uncertainties and other contingencies.
The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty
inherent in those estimates and assumptions.</P>

<P align=justify><U>Revenue Recognition</U></P>
<P align=justify>Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the sales price is
fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company
mainly sells human albumin and human immunoglobulin to hospitals, inoculation
centers and pharmaceutical distributors. The Company requires a contract or
purchase order which specify pricing, quantity and product specifications for
all sales. Delivery of the product occurs at the point in time the product is
received by the customer, which is when the risks and rewards of ownership have
been transferred. Delivery is evidenced by a signed customer acceptance form.
Sales are presented net of any discounts given to customers. For the year ended
December 31, 2009 and 2010, there were no significant sales return from the
customers of the Company.</P>
<P align=justify><U>Fair Value Measurements</U></P>
<P align=justify>On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB's accounting
standard related to fair value measurements and began recording financial assets
and liabilities subject to recurring fair value measurement at the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. These fair value principles prioritize
valuation inputs across three broad levels. The Company considers the carrying
amount of cash, receivables, payables including accrued liabilities and short
term loans to approximate their fair values because of the short period of time
between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and
if applicable, their stated rates of interest are equivalent to interest rates
currently available. The fair values are measured pursuant to the three levels
defined by the FASB's accounting standard as follow: </P>
<UL style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
  <LI>
  <P>Level 1: inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted)
  for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Level 2: inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for
  similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are
  observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
  substantially the full term of the financial instruments. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Level 3: inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and
  significant to the fair value. </P></LI></UL>
<P align=justify>The fair value of the embedded conversion option in the Notes
of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was determined based on the Binominal option
pricing model, using the following key assumptions: </P>

<P align=justify><U>Accounts Receivable and Allowance For Doubtful
Accounts</U></P>
<P align=justify>Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do
not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing
the required allowance, management considers historical losses adjusted to take
into account current market conditions and the customers&#146; financial condition,
the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and
current payment patterns. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful
accounts monthly. Past due balances are reviewed individually for
collectability. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all
means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is
considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit
exposure related to its customers.</P>
<P align=justify>Depending on the relationship and the creditability of the
distributors, we generally grant a credit period of no longer than 30 days to
distributors with some exceptions. For hospitals and clinics, we generally grant
a credit period of no longer than 90 days. We had a bad debt credit of $0.1
million for 2010, a bad debt expense of $0.3 million for 2009 and a bad debt
credit of $0.1 million for 2008 related to the sales of our products. The $0.1
million bad debt credit for both 2010 and 2008 is due to recovery of bad debt
previously reserved. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Inventories</U></P>
<P align=justify>Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the weighted average method. Cost of work in progress and
finished goods comprise direct materials, direct production costs and an
allocation of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.</P>
<P align=justify>The Company reviews its inventory periodically for possible
obsolete goods and cost in excess of net realizable value to determine if any
reserves are necessary. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company wrote off
$1,000,277 and $519,333 relating to obsolete raw material
plasma that may not qualify for production due to the 90-day quarantine period
rules implemented by State Food and Drug Administration on July 1, 2008.</P>
<P align=justify><U>Stock-based Compensation</U></P>
<P align=justify>The Company measures the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value
of the award and recognizes the cost over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the
vesting period.</P>
<P align=justify>The fair value of each option granted on May 9, 2008, July 24,
2008, January 7, 2010, February 4, 2010 and July 11, 2010 are estimated on the
respective dates of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following major assumptions: </P>

<P align=justify>The volatility of the Company&#146;s common stock was estimated by
management based on the historical volatility of the Company&#146;s common stock. The
risk free interest rate was based on Treasury Constant Maturity Rates published
by the U.S. Federal Reserve for periods applicable to the estimated term of the
options. The expected dividend yield was based on the Company&#146;s current and
expected dividend policy. The weighted average grant date fair value of options
granted during the year of 2010 was $10.70. </P>

<P align=justify><U>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets</U></P>
<P align=justify>In accordance with Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Subsections of FASB ASC Subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment.
Overall, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased
intangible asset subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset
group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying
value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an
undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the
carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various
valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values
and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. No impairment
of long-lived assets was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2010 and
2009. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</B></P>
<P align=justify>In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
(&#147;ASU&#148;) 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
Arrangements (EITF Issue No. 08-1, &#147;Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables&#148;). ASU 2009-13 amends FASB ASC Subtopic 605-25 to eliminate the
requirement that all undelivered elements have vendor specific objective
evidence of selling price (&#147;VSOE&#148;) or third party evidence of selling price
(&#147;TPE&#148;) before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee
that is attributable to items that already have been delivered. In the absence
of VSOE or TPE for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a
multiple-element arrangement, entities will be required to estimate the selling
prices of those elements. The overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each
element (both delivered and undelivered items) based on their relative selling
prices, regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by VSOE or TPE
or are based on the entity&#146;s estimated selling price. Application of the
&#147;residual method&#148; of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and
undelivered elements will no longer be permitted upon adoption of ASU 2009-13.
Additionally, the new guidance will require entities to disclose more
information about their multiple-element revenue arrangements. ASU 2009-13 is
effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially
modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early adoption is
permitted. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of
adopting ASU 2009-13 on the Company&#146;s financial position and results of
operations.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Seasonality of our Sales</B></P>
<P align=justify>Our operating results and operating cash flows historically
have not been subject to seasonal variations. This pattern may change, however,
as a result of new market opportunities or new product introductions. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Inflation</B></P>
<P align=justify>Inflation does not materially affect our business or the
results of our operations.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</B></P>
<P align=justify>We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to our investors. </P>
<P align=justify><B>ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK.</B></P>
<P align=justify>Our operations are carried out in the PRC and we are subject to
specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with
companies in North America and Western Europe. Accordingly, our business,
financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the
political, economic and legal environments in the PRC, and by the general state
of the PRC economy. Our results may be adversely affected by changes in
governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary
measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of
taxation, among other things. </P>
<P align=justify><B>Interest Rate Risk</B></P>
<P align=justify>We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to
our short-term and long-term bank loans. Although the interest rates, which are
based on the banks&#146; prime rates with respect to our short-term loans are fixed
for the terms of the loans, the terms are typically three to twelve months for
short-term bank loans and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal.
There were no material changes in interest rates for short-term bank loans
renewed during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010.</P>
<P align=justify>A hypothetical 1.0% increase in the annual interest rates for
all of our credit facilities under which we had outstanding borrowings as of
December 31, 2010, would decrease net income before provision for income taxes
by approximately $30,340 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. Management monitors the banks&#146; prime rates
in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of
debt balances relative to other sources of funds. We have not entered into any
hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate
risk.</P>

<P align=justify><B>Foreign Exchange Risk</B></P>
<P align=justify>While our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, all of our
consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and majority of expenses are
denominated in RMB. All of our assets are denominated in RMB, except certain
cash balances. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our
revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the
exchange rate between U.S. Dollars and RMB. If RMB depreciates against the U.S.
Dollar, the value of our RMB revenues, earnings and assets as expressed in our
U.S. Dollar financial statements will decline. Assets and liabilities are
translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses
are translated at the average exchange rates and shareholders&#146; equity is
translated at historical exchange rates. Any resulting translation adjustments
are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other
comprehensive income, a component of stockholder&#146;s equity. We have not entered
into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign
exchange risk.</P>
<P align=justify>The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other
currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China&#146;s political and
economic conditions. Since July 2005, the RMB has not been pegged to the U.S.
dollar. Although the People&#146;s Bank of China regularly involved in the foreign
exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange
rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the
U.S. dollar or Euro in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in
the future, PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in RMB
exchange rate and lessen involvement in the foreign exchange market.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Account Balances</B></P>
<P align=justify>We maintain balances at financial institutions which, from time
to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits for the
banks located in the United States or may exceed Hong Kong Deposit Protection
Board insured limits for the banks located in Hong Kong. Balances at financial
institutions or state-owned banks within the PRC are not covered by insurance.
Total cash in banks as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $64,443,315 and
$53,576,495, respectively, $1,473,917 and $1,009,053 of which are covered by
insurance, respectively. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts and
we do not believe that we are exposed to any significant risks on our cash in
bank accounts.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Inflation</B></P>
<P align=justify>Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our sales
and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do
not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may
have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin
and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if
the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased
costs.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Market for Human Albumin</B></P>
<P align=justify>The Company&#146;s major product, human albumin: 20%/10ml, 20%/25ml,
20%/50ml, 10%/10ml, 10%/25ml and 10%/50ml, accounted for 48.0% and 49.7% of the
total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. If
the market demands for human albumin cannot be sustained in the future or if the
price of human albumin decreases, it would adversely affect our operating
results.</P>

consolidated financial statements for each of these quarters have been prepared
on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in

<font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">
<p align="justify">Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a] 15(e) and 15d]
15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)). Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive
officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on our assessment, Mr. Zhao and
Mr. Kuo determined that, as of December 31, 2010, and as of the date that the
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was
completed, because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective to satisfy the objectives for which they are intended.</p>
<p align="justify">Notwithstanding management&#146;s assessment that our internal
control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2010 due to
the material weakness described below under Management&#146;s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, we believe that the consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K correctly present our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years
covered thereby in all material respects. </p>

<p align="justify"><i><b>(a) Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting </b></i> </p>
<p align="justify">Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a<font LANG="JA">] </font>15(f) and 15d<font LANG="JA">] </font>15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act. The Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting is a process that is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and includes those policies
and procedures that: </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 5%">(1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of our assets; </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 5%">(2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with the authorization of our management and directors; and </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 5%">(3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. </p>
<p align="justify">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </p>
<p align="justify">Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as based on framework established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) as of December 31, 2010. Based on such evaluation,
our management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that the Company&#146;s
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a<font LANG="JA">]
</font>15(f) and 15d<font LANG="JA">] </font>15(f) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2010 is ineffective. </p>
<p align="justify">This assessment identified ineffective review controls on the
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and derivative instrument valuation,
because of lack of resources with expertise in non<font LANG="JA">] </font>
recurring transactions, which resulted in inadvertently omission of the fair
value of embedded option in warrants and misinterpretation of US GAAP regarding
the recognition of deferred tax liabilities upon business combination. The
Company has already taken measures to remediate these material weaknesses by
adding two additional qualified accountants in late 2010 and enhancing the
supervision, monitoring and reviewing of financial statement preparation
processes. Furthermore, the Company has already engaged outside consultants
specializing in deferred tax accounting and derivative instrument valuation, as
well as in reinforcing the rigorous process for collecting and reviewing
information required for the preparation of the financial statements including
footnotes. </p>
<p align="justify">The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010 has been audited by our registered public accounting firm as
stated in their report appearing herein under Item 9(b) of this Annual Report on
Form 10<font LANG="JA">] </font>K . Our independent registered public accounting
firm has issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. </p>

</i> </p>
<p align="justify">The Board of Directors and Stockholders <br>
China Biologic Products, Inc.: </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have audited China Biologic Products, Inc.&#146;s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
established in <i>Internal Control - Integrated Framework</i> issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). China
Biologic Products, Inc.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </p>
</font>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#146;s annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Material weaknesses related to review controls on the determination of
fair values of derivative instruments and the recognition of deferred tax
liabilities upon business combination have been identified and included in
management&#146;s assessment. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheet of China Biologic Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders&#146; equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the year then
ended. These two material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature,
timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of those consolidated
financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 31,
2011, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our opinion, because of the effects of the aforementioned
material weaknesses on the achievement of the objectives of the control
criteria, China Biologic Products, Inc. has not maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
established in </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">

promote: honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;
full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that we file with, or submit to, the SEC, and in other public
communications that we made; compliance with applicable government laws, rules
and regulations; the prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to the
appropriate person or persons; and accountability for adherence to the code.</P>
<P align=justify>The code requires the highest standard of ethical conduct and
fair dealing of its senior financial officers, defined as the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. While this policy is intended to only cover

to reward exceptional performance. </P>

participate in Compensation Committee meetings and is not involved in decisions
relating to his own compensation.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Elements of Compensation</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>We pay each of our named executive officers a base annual
salary. Bonuses and equity incentives may also be provided to supplement base
salary. The criteria for determining each of these components of compensation is
described below. We do not provide retirement benefits and only minimal
perquisites except as described below.</P>
<P align=justify><U>Base Salary</U></P>
<P align=justify>Base salary levels for executive officers are set forth in
their individual employment agreements, and are reflected in the Summary
Compensation Table below. The Compensation Committee considered the total
compensation paid by other biopharmaceutical companies in Shandong, China to
persons holding equivalent positions in setting base salary levels. However, the
Compensation Committee did not conduct a peer group compensation analysis or
target any particular compensation level in establishing the base salaries for
named executive officers. </P>
<P align=justify>The Compensation Committee believes that any increases in base
salary should be based upon a favorable evaluation of individual performance
relative to individual goals, the functioning of the executive&#146;s team within the
corporate structure, success in furthering corporate strategy and goals,
individual management skills and responsibilities, demonstrated loyalty, and the
Company&#146;s commitment to attract and retain executives. We expect that our
Compensation Committee will reward superior individual and company performance
with commensurate cash and other compensation. The Compensation Committee did
not increase base salary during fiscal year 2010. Salary will next be reviewed
when the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, but the Compensation
Committee will not review salary more frequently than on an annual basis. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Bonuses</U></P>
<P align=justify>Executives are eligible to receive a discretionary bonus
pursuant to the terms of their respective employment agreements. However, in
fiscal 2010 we did not set any performance targets and no discretionary bonuses
were paid. If our Compensation Committee determines to do so in the future,
bonuses may be paid on an ad hoc basis to recognize superior performance. If the
Compensation Committee determines to provide bonus compensation as a regular
part of our executive compensation package, it will establish performance goals
for each of the executive officers and maximum bonuses that may be earned upon
attainment of such performance goals. Some of the components of our key
performance appraisal index that we may use to consider in establishing these
performance goals include the following: cash flow (accounts receivable,
inventory, accounts payable); sales (revenue, accounts receivables collection,
gross profit, customer credit management and goods delivery management); costs
and expenses (financial costs, manufacturing costs, general and administrative
expenses, sales and marketing expenses, research and development costs); and
capital expenditures. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Equity Incentives</U></P>
<P align=justify>Named executive officers are eligible for equity awards in the
form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, restricted
stock, restricted stock units and performance shares under the China Biologic
Products, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2008 Plan. Equity awards are
granted at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The size of an award to
any individual, including named executive officers, depends in part on
individual performance, including the components of our key performance
appraisal index described above and any other indicators of the impact that such
employee&#146;s productivity may have on stockholder value over time. Other factors include salary level and competitive data. In addition,
in determining the awards granted to each named executive officer, the
Compensation Committee considers the future benefits potentially available to
the named executive officers from existing awards. </P>

<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_58></A>
<P align=justify>We have no program, plan or practice of granting equity awards
that coincide with the release by the Company of material non-public
information. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Retirement Benefits</U></P>
<P align=justify>Currently, we do not provide any company-sponsored retirement
benefits or deferred compensation programs to any employee, including the named
executive officers (other than a mandatory state pension scheme in which all of
our employees in China participate) because it is not customary to provide such
benefits and programs in China. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Perquisites</U></P>
<P align=justify>Historically, we have provided our named executive officers
with minimal perquisites and other personal benefits that we believe are
reasonable, such as company car-related benefits. We do not view perquisites as
a significant element of compensation, but do believe they can be useful in
attracting, motivating and retaining the executive talent for which we
compete.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Summary Compensation Table &#151; Fiscal Years Ended December 31,

and non-cash compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to the named persons for
services rendered in all capacities during the noted periods. No other executive
officer received total annual salary and bonus compensation in excess of
$100,000. </P>

      <P align=justify>Effective May 9, 2008, our board of directors adopted the

      appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock, restricted stock
      units and performance shares. A total of five million (5,000,000) shares
      of our common stock may be issued pursuant to the 2008 Plan. The exercise
      price per share for the shares to be issued pursuant to an exercise of a
      stock option will be no less than the fair market value per share on the
      grant date, except that, in the case of an incentive stock option granted
      to a person who holds more than 10% of the total combined voting power of
      all classes of our stock or any of our subsidiaries, the exercise price
      will be no less than 110% of the fair market value per share on the grant

  (&#147;Guizhou Eakan&#148;), the affiliate of one of the Guizhou Taibang&#146;s
  noncontrolling interests holders. The Company&#146;s total processing services
  income from Guizhou Eakan amounted to $499,128 and $705,018 for the years
  ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, Guizhou Taibang
  made sales to Guizhou Eakan, amounting to $521,306, for the year ended
  December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, accounts receivable due
  from Guizhou Eakan amounted to $212,611 and $222,617, respectively. The

  <P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12">On April 6, 2009, Logic Express entered into an agreement with Shandong
  Institute, the noncontrolling interest holders in Shandong Taibang, pursuant
  to which, Shandong Institute would provide an advance to assist Logic
  Express&#146;s purchase of 90% Dalin's equity interests. Under the
  terms of the agreement, Shandong Institute agreed to provide advance of
  approximately $3,652,500 then (RMB25,000,000), representing 12.86% of the Company&#146;s purchase
  consideration in Dalin to the Company for one year, bearing interest equal to
  the higher of a proportionate share of the net income of Dalin during the year
  ended December 31, 2009 or 6% per annum. On April 12, 2010, the Company fully
  paid the advance from Shandong Institute and the interest of approximately
  $1.3 million, which was less than the Company&#146;s previous estimate by
  approximately $0.9 million. The Company recorded the difference between the
  previous estimate and actual payment in other income of the consolidated

  approximately $2,195,123 (RMB14,470,160). Guizhou Eakan Investing Corp. is one

  borrowed this interest free advance for working capital purpose for Guizhou
  Taibang. The balance is due on demand. </P>

  <P style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 12">Guizhou Taibang has payables to Guizhou Jie&#146;an, a noncontrolling interest
  holder of Guizhou Taibang, amounting to approximately $997,017 (RMB
  6,569,840). In 2007, Guizhou Taibang received additional contributions from
  Guizhou Jie&#146;an of&nbsp; approximately $962,853 then (RMB 6,569,840) to maintain Jie&#146;an equity interest in Guizhou
  Taibang at 9%. However, due to a legal dispute among shareholders over raising
  additional capital as discussed in the legal proceeding section (see note 20),
  the money may be returned to Jie&#146;an. During the second quarter of 2010, Jie&#146;an
  requested that Guizhou Taibang register its 1.8 million shares of additional
  capital infusion with the local Administration for Industry and Commerce,
  pursuant to the equity purchase agreement, and such registration was approved
  by the majority shareholders of Guizhou Taibang in a shareholders meeting held
  in the second quarter of 2010. However, the Board of Directors of the Company
  is withholding its required ratification of the shareholders&#146; approval of
  Jie&#146;an&#146;s request until the outcome of the ongoing litigations. If the Company
  decided to ratify the approval, Dalin&#146;s ownership in Guizhou Taibang will be
diluted from 54% to 52.54% and Guizhou Jie&#146;an will be entitled to receive its
pro rata share of Guizhou Taibang&#146;s profits from the prior 2 years.</font></P></LI></UL>

<P align=justify>Except as set forth in our discussion above, none of our
directors, director nominees or executive officers has been involved in any
transactions with us or any of our directors, executive officers, affiliates or
associates which are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the SEC.</P>
<P align=justify><B>Policies and Procedures for Review, Approval or Ratification
of Transactions with Related Persons</B></P>
<P align=justify>On July 27, 2009, our board of directors adopted the China
Biologic Products, Inc. Related Party Transactions Policy and Procedures, or the
Policy. Under the Policy, all Interested Transactions with Related Parties are
subject to approval or ratification in accordance with the procedures set forth
below. There were no related party transactions since the beginning of the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 for which our Policy did not require review,
approval or ratification, or where our Policy was not followed.</P>
<P align=justify>The Policy defines an &#147;Interested Transaction&#148; is any
transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions,
arrangements or relationships (including any indebtedness or guarantee of
indebtedness) in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected
to exceed $100,000 in any calendar year, (2) the Company is a participant, and
(3) any Related Party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than
solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10 percent beneficial
owner of another entity). A &#147;Related Party&#148; is defined as any (a) person who is
or was (since the beginning of the last fiscal year for which the Company has
filed a Form 10-K and proxy statement, even if they do not presently serve in
that role) an executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director,
(b) greater than 5 percent beneficial owner of our common stock, or (c)
immediate family member of any of the foregoing. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Procedures</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Under the Policy, the Governance and Nominating Committee shall
review the material facts of all Interested Transactions that require the
Committee&#146;s approval and either approve or disapprove of the entry into the
Interested Transaction, subject to the exceptions described below. If advance
Committee approval of an Interested Transaction is not feasible, then the
Interested Transaction shall be considered and, if the Committee determines it
to be appropriate, ratified at the Committee&#146;s next regularly scheduled meeting.
In determining whether to approve or ratify an Interested Transaction, the
Governance and Nominating Committee will take into account, among other factors
it deems appropriate, whether the Interested Transaction is on terms no less
favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under
the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the Related Party&#146;s interest
in the transaction.</P>
<P align=justify>The Governance and Nominating Committee has reviewed the
Interested Transactions described below in &#147;Standing Pre-Approval for Certain
Interested Transactions&#148; and determined that each of the Interested Transactions
described therein shall be deemed to be pre-approved or ratified (as applicable)
by the Governance and Nominating Committee under the terms of the Policy. In
addition, the board of directors has delegated to the Chair of the Governance
and Nominating Committee the authority to pre-approve or ratify (as applicable)
any Interested Transaction with a Related Party in which the aggregate amount
involved is expected to be less than $250,000. In connection with each regularly
scheduled meeting of the Governance and Nominating Committee, a summary of each
new Interested Transaction deemed pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4)
under &#147;Standing Pre- Approval for Certain Interested Transactions&#148; below and
each new Interested Transaction preapproved by the Chair in accordance shall be
provided to the Committee for its review.</P>
<P align=justify>Under the Policy, no director shall participate in any
discussion or approval of an Interested Transaction for which he or she is a
Related Party, except that the director shall provide all material information
concerning the Interested Transaction to the Governance and Nominating
Committee.</P>
<P align=justify>If an Interested Transaction will be ongoing, the Governance
and Nominating Committee may establish guidelines for our management to follow
in its ongoing dealings with the Related Party. Thereafter, the Governance and
Nominating Committee, on at least an annual basis, shall review and assess
ongoing relationships with the Related Party to see that they are in compliance
with the Committee&#146;s guidelines and that the Interested Transaction remains
appropriate.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Standing Pre-Approval for Certain Interested

<p>The Board of Directors and Stockholders <br>
China Biologic Products, Inc.: </p>
<p align="justify">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
of China Biologic Products, Inc. and subsidiaries (the &quot;Company&quot;) as of December
31, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders&#146;
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the year then ended. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audit. </p>
<p align="justify">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. </p>
<p align="justify">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of China Biologic Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then
ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. </p>
<p align="justify">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), China Biologic
Products, Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2010, based on criteria established in <i>Internal Control &#150; Integrated
Framework</i> issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 31, 2011 expressed an
adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting. </p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company&#146;s subsidiary, Guizhou Taibang Biological Products Co.,
Ltd. (&quot;Guizhou Taibang&quot;) is a defendant in a lawsuit brought by certain
potential investors with respect to Guizhou Taibang&#146;s failure to register their
capital contributions in Guizhou Taibang with the local Administration for
Industry and Commerce. </p>

<p align="justify">To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of <br>
China Biologic Products, Inc. </p>
<p align="justify">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of China Biologic Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and
2008, and the related consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive
income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year
period ended December 31, 2009. China Biologic Products, Inc.&#146;s management is
responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. </p>
<p align="justify">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. </p>

referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of China Biologic Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </p>

<P align=center>CHINA BIOLOGIC PRODUCTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES <BR>NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS <BR>DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 </P>
<P align=justify><B>NOTE 1 &#150; ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND AND PRINCIPAL
ACTIVITIES</B> </P>
<P align=justify>A. Reorganization and Principal Activities</P>
<P align=justify>China Biologic Products, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;CBP&#148;, formerly
known as &#147;GRC Holdings, Inc.&#148;) was originally incorporated in the State of Texas
in 1989. On July 19, 2006, the Company and its principle shareholders entered
into a share exchange agreement (the &#147;Exchange Agreement&#148;) with Logic Express
Ltd. (&#147;Logic Express&#148;), a privately held investment holding company incorporated
on January 6, 2006 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and all the
shareholders of Logic Express (the &#147;Logic Express Shareholders&#148;). Pursuant to
the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Logic Express Shareholders transferred
to the Company all of their shares in exchange for 18,484,715 shares of the
Company&#146;s common shares (the &#147;Share Exchange&#148;). As a result of the Share
Exchange, Logic Express became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the
Logic Express Shareholders received approximately 96.1% of the Company&#146;s issued
and outstanding common shares. Immediately prior to the date of the Share
Exchange, the Company was a publicly listed shell entity with no operations and,
Logic Express, through its 82.76% owned subsidiary, Shandong Taibang Biological
Products Co. Ltd. (&#147;Shandong Taibang&#148;), was engaged in the research,
development, commercialization, manufacture and sale of human blood products
primarily in the People&#146;s Republic of China ( the &#147;PRC&#148; or China). The Share
Exchange was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, equivalent to the
issuance of stock by Logic Express for the net monetary assets of the Company
accompanied by a recapitalization. After consummation of the Share Exchange, the
Company converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to China
Biologic Products, Inc. on January 10, 2007. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company is a biopharmaceutical company and, through its PRC
subsidiaries, is principally engaged in the research, development, manufacturing
and sales of plasma-based pharmaceutical products in PRC. The PRC subsidiaries
own plasma stations to purchase and collect plasma from individual donors for a
fee. The plasma is processed into finished goods after passing through a series
of fractionating processes. All of the Company&#146;s products are prescription
medicines which require government approval on the quality before the products
are sold to customers. The Company primarily sells its products to hospitals and
inoculation centers directly or through distributors in the PRC. </P>
<P align=justify>On September 26, 2008, the Company, through Logic Express,
entered in an equity purchase agreement with Guiyang Dalin Biologic Technologies
Co. Ltd. (&#147;Dalin&#148;, formerly known as &#147;Chongqing Dalin Biologic Technologies Co.
Ltd.&#148;), an investment holding company, and certain equity owners of Dalin, to
acquire 90% equity interest of Dalin. The purchase consideration for the 90%
equity interest in Dalin was RMB 194,400,000 (or approximately $28,479,600) in
cash (See Note 17).</P>
<P align=justify>Dalin holds 54% equity interest in Guiyang Qianfeng Biological
Products Co., Ltd. (&#147;Qianfeng&#148;), which changed its name to Guizhou Taibang
Biological Products Co., Ltd. (&#147;Guizhou Taibang&#148;) on December 30, 2010. Qianfeng
is one of the largest plasma-based biopharmaceutical companies in China and is
the only manufacturer currently operating in Guizhou Province. Qianfeng is in
compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices certified by State Food and
Drug Administration (&#147;SFDA&#148;) for the manufacturing, sale and distribution of
Human Albumin, Human Immunoglobulin, Human Intravenous Immunoglobulin, Human
Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin, Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin and Human Rabies Immune
Globulin. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company completed the acquisition of 90% equity interests
in Dalin in Janurary, 2009. On December 28, 2009, the Company&#146;s 90% equity
interest in Dalin was transferred to Logic Management Consulting (China) Co.,
Ltd. (&#147;Logic China&#148;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (see Note 17).
The Company established Logic China in December 2009, for the purpose of being
the holding company of the 90% equity interest in Dalin.</P>
<P align=justify>On August 5, 2010, Logic China established a wholly-owned
subsidiary, Logic Taibang Biological Institute (Beijing) (&#147;Logic Beijing&#148;), with
registered capital of $149,700 (RMB 1 million). Logic Beijing is principally
engaged in the research and development of plasma-based pharmaceutical products
and will coordinate the research and development activities of the Company and
its subsidiaries. </P>

<P align=justify>On January 13, 2010, Shandong Taibang acquired the remaining
20% equity interest in Fangcheng Plasma Company from the noncontrolling interest
holder (see Note 20).  Since the additional purchase of 20%
equity interest did not result in a change of the Company&#146;s control over Fangcheng Plasma Company, this transaction was accounted for as an equity
transaction. After the acquisition, Fangcheng Plasma Company became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Shandong Taibang. </P>
<P align=justify>On July 8, 2010, Logic China entered into an equity purchase
agreement with Shandong Taibang, to acquire 100% equity interest in Shandong
Taibang Medical Company (&#147;Taibang Medical&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Shandong Taibang. The cash consideration of the 100% equity interest in Taibang
Medical was RMB 6,440,000 (approximately $947,327). The transaction was
completed on September 23, 2010. The purpose of this transaction is to
effectively acquire the 17.24% equity interest indirectly held by the
noncontrolling interest in Shandong Taibang, which will enable the Company to
consolidate its resources in the sales and marketing of Shandong Taibang and
Guizhou Taibang&#146;s products. This transaction was accounted for as an equity
transaction. </P>
<P align=justify>On November 11, 2010, the Company established Qianfeng
Biological Science Company (&#147;Qianfeng Biologic&#148;) for the purpose of research and
development of placenta based products. As of December 31, 2010, Qianfeng
Biologic, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Guizhou Taibang, had no
operations. </P>
<P align=justify><B>NOTE 2 &#150; SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</B> </P>
<P align=justify><U>Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation</U>
</P>
<P align=justify>The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the
Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (&#147;GAAP&#148;), and include the financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Use of Estimates</U></P>
<P align=justify>The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items
subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of fixed
assets; the allowance for doubtful accounts; the fair value determinations of
financial and equity instruments and stock compensation awards, assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in a business combination; the realizability of deferred
tax assets and inventories; the recoverability of goodwill, intangible asset,
land use right and property, plant and equipment; and accruals for income tax
uncertainties and other contingencies. The current economic environment has
increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in those estimates and assumptions.
</P>
<P align=justify><U>Foreign Currency Translation</U></P>
<P align=justify>The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the
Company are reported in US dollar. The financial position and results of
operations of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries in the PRC are measured using the
Renminbi, the local and functional currency of these entities. Assets and
liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at the prevailing exchange rate
in effect at each period end. Income statement accounts are translated at the
average rate of exchange during the period. Translation adjustments are included
in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of
stockholders&#146; equity and comprehensive income. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Revenue Recognition</U></P>
<P align=justify>Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the sales price is
fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company
mainly sells human albumin and human immunoglobulin to hospitals, inoculation
centers and pharmaceutical distributors. The Company requires a contract or
purchase order which specify pricing, quantity and product specifications for
all sales. Delivery of the product occurs when the product is received by the
customer, which is when the risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred. Delivery is evidenced by a signed customer acceptance form. Sales
are presented net of any discounts given to customers. For the year ended
December 31, 2009 and 2010, there were no significant sales return from the
customers.</P>

<!--$$/page=--><A name=page_12></A>
<P align=justify><U>Fair Value Measurements</U> </P>
<P align=justify>The Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10,
<I>Fair Value Measurements</I>, for fair value measurements of financial assets
and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items
that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements. ASC
Subtopic 820-10 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company has included
these disclosures in Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P align=justify>ASC Subtopic 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When
determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or
permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or
most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. </P>
<P align=justify>ASC Subtopic 820-10 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC Subtopic 820-10
establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 12">Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
  identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at
  the measurement date.
  <LI>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 12">Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
  that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

  <LI>Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
</LI></UL>
<P align=justify>The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value
measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Cash and Cash Equivalents</U></P>
<P align=justify>Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand
deposits. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three-month or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had cash maintained at banks
in the PRC, BVI, Hong Kong and the United States of $62,898,395, $1,376,822,
$64,205 and $103,894, respectively. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Accounts Receivable and Allowance For Doubtful Accounts</U>
</P>
<P align=justify>Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do
not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing
the required allowance, management considers historical losses adjusted to take
into account current market conditions and the customers&#146; financial condition,
the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and
current payment patterns. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful
accounts monthly. Past due balances are reviewed individually for
collectability. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all
means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is
considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit
exposure related to its customers. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Inventories</U></P>
<P align=justify>Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is

<P align=justify><U>Equity method investment</U> </P>
<P align=justify>Investment in an investee in which the Company has the ability
to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling interest is
accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence is generally
presumed to exist when the Company has an ownership interest in the voting stock
between 20% and 50%, and other factors, such as representation on the board of
directors and participation in policy-making processes, are considered in
determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under the
equity method of accounting, the Company&#146;s share of the investee&#146;s results of
operations is included in other income (expense) in the Company&#146;s consolidated
statements of income. The Company recognizes a loss if it is determined that
other than temporary decline in the value of the investment exists. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Intangible Assets</U></P>
<P align=justify>Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated
amortization. Amortization expense is recognized on the straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives, as the pattern in which the economic benefits of the
intangible assets are used up cannot be reliably determined. The estimated
useful live is the period over which the intangible asset is expected to
contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the Company. The
Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Estimate useful
lives of the assets are as follows: </P>

<P align=justify><U>Land use right</U>s</P>
<P align=justify>Land use rights represent the exclusive right to occupy and use
a piece of land in the PRC for a specified contractual term. Land use rights are
carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated using
the straight-line method over the lives of the rights ranging from 39 to 50
years. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Goodwill</U> </P>
<P align=justify>Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition
over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but
is instead tested for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually
in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 350, <I>Intangibles -
Goodwill and Other. </I>The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. Under
the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its
carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is
less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for
the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment
test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any
excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill over the implied
fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by
allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a
purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of the
reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. If the fair
value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, step two does not need
to be performed. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company performs its annual impairment review of goodwill
at each December 31, and when a triggering event occurs between annual
impairment tests. No impairment of goodwill was recorded for the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009. </P>

<P align=justify><U>Income Taxes</U> </P>
<P align=justify>Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in
the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided
to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
</P>
<P align=justify>The Company recognizes in the consolidated financial statements
the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being
sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.
Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is
greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement
are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company
records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and
penalties in selling, general, and administrative expenses. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Stock-based Compensation</U> </P>
<P align=justify>The Company measures the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value
of the award and recognizes the cost over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the
vesting period. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets</U> </P>
<P align=justify>In accordance with Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Subsections of FASB ASC Subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment -
Overall, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased
intangible asset subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset
group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying
value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not
recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to
the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is
determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow
models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as
considered necessary. No impairment of long-lived assets was recognized for the
years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.</P>
<P align=justify><U>Earnings Per Share</U> </P>
<P align=justify>Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
attributable to the Company by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
dilution that would occur upon the exercise of outstanding warrants, options and
the conversion of the convertible notes. Common share equivalents are excluded
from the computation of the diluted earnings per share when their effect would
be anti-dilutive.</P>
<P align=justify><U>Segment Reporting</U> </P>
<P align=justify>The Company has one operating segment, which is the manufacture
and sales of human blood products. Substantially all of the Company&#146;s operations
and customers are located in the PRC, and therefore, no geographic information
is presented. </P>
<P align=justify><U>Contingencies</U> </P>
<P align=justify>In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to
loss contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its
business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others,
government investigations and tax matters. An accrual for a loss contingency is
recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
of loss can be reasonably estimated.</P>
<P align=justify><U>Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</U></P>
<P align=justify>In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
(&#147;ASU&#148;) 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
Arrangements (EITF Issue No. 08-1, &#147;Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables&#148;). ASU 2009-13 amends FASB ASC Subtopic 605-25 to eliminate the
requirement that all undelivered elements have vendor specific objective
evidence of selling price (&#147;VSOE&#148;) or third party evidence of selling price
(&#147;TPE&#148;) before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee
that is attributable to items that already have been delivered. In the absence
of VSOE or TPE for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a
multiple-element arrangement, entities will be required to estimate the selling
prices of those elements. The overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each
element (both delivered and undelivered items) based on their relative selling
prices, regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by VSOE or TPE
or are based on the entity&#146;s estimated selling price. Application of the
&#147;residual method&#148; of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and
undelivered elements will no longer be permitted upon adoption of ASU 2009-13. Additionally, the new guidance will require entities to
disclose more information about their multiple-element revenue arrangements. ASU
2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early
adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact,
if any, of adopting ASU 2009-13 on the Company&#146;s financial position and results
of operations.

      <P align=justify>In 2009, 107 employees of the Company entered into
      agreements with developers in two housing projects. According to these
      agreements, the employees placed deposits equal to 80% of the purchase
      price of the residential units in these two housing projects with
      developers. To assist with their deposits, the Company entered into
      separate agreements with the employees by providing advances to them for
      an amount up to
      50% of the purchase price of the residential units. The advances bear an
      annual interest rate of 3.89%. As of December 31, 2010, these two housing
      projects were still in construction stage. The Company expects the
      employees to settle these advances in 2011. </P></TD></TR>

<P align=justify>The Company&#146;s equity method investment as of December 31, 2010
and 2009 represented 35% equity interest investment in Xi&#146;an Huitian Blood
Products Co., Ltd. (&#147;Huitian&#148;). </P>
<P align=justify>In October 2008, Shandong Taibang entered into an equity
purchase agreement with one of the equity owners of Huitian (&#147;Seller&#148;) to
acquire 35% equity interest in Huitian, for cash consideration of $6,454,800 (or
RMB 44,000,000). In connection with this transaction, in October 2008, Logic
Express entered into an entrust agreement (the &#147;Entrust Agreement&#148;) with
Shandong Taibang and the noncontrolling interest holder of Shandong Taibang,
pursuant to which, Logic Express would pay the cash consideration of $6,502,901
to the Seller, and would bear the risks and benefits as a 35% equity owner in
Huitian. In addition, Logic Express would pay Shandong Taibang $18,204 (or RMB
120,000) per year as compensation for the administrative costs of its holding of
the 35% equity interest in Huitian on behalf of Logic Express. Such amount paid
and received is eliminated upon consolidation. Logic Express agreed to indemnify
the noncontrolling interest holder of Shandong Taibang for any loss arising from
the Entrust Agreement and has pledged the Company&#146;s equity interest in Shandong
Taibang as collateral against such loss. </P>
<P align=justify>The excess of cost over the Company's share of net assets of
equity method investees is $1,145,966 at December 31, 2010. </P>

<P align=justify>The deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards of
$2,575,574 as of December 31, 2010 of which $279,578 and $2,295,996 relate to
tax loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries and the Company, respectively.
For PRC income tax purposes, certain of the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries had tax
loss carryforwards of $1,118,311 which would expire in December 2015, if unused.
For United States federal income tax purposes, the Company had tax loss
carryforwards of approximately $6,752,930, of which $1,268,307, $614,982,
$1,113,597, $1,405,718 and $2,350,326 would expire on December 31, 2026, 2027,
2028, 2029 and 2030, respectively, if unused. Management determined it is more
likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized, and
therefore, full valuation allowances were provided as of December 31, 2010 and
2009. The increase in valuation allowance during the years ended December 31,
2010 and 2009 was $2,806,835 and $477,944, respectively. </P>
<P align=justify>In assessing the realizability of the Company&#146;s deferred tax
assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable
income during the periods in which the deductible temporary differences and the
tax loss carryforwards are utilized. The Company considers historical
performance, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in
making its assessment. Management believes it is more likely than not that the
Company will realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets, net of the
valuation allowances, as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. </P>
<P align=justify>According to the prevailing PRC income tax law and relevant
regulations, dividends received by non-PRC-resident enterprises from
PRC-resident enterprises are subject to withholding tax at 10%, unless reduced
by tax treaties or similar arrangement, on earnings accumulated beginning on
January 1, 2008. Undistributed earnings generated prior to January 1, 2008 are
exempt from such withholding tax. Further, dividends received by the Company
from its overseas subsidiaries are subject to the U.S. federal income tax at
34%, less any qualified foreign tax credits. Due to the Company&#146;s policy of
reinvesting its earnings in its overseas business, the Company has not provided
for the related deferred tax liabilities on undistributed earnings of $90
million and $54 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. It is
not practicable to estimate the amounts of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities
thereof.</P>
<P align=justify>As of January 1, 2009 and for each of the years ended December
31, 2009 and 2010, the Company and its subsidiaries did not have any
unrecognized tax benefits, and therefore no interest or penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits were accrued. The Company does not expect that the
amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next 12
months. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company and each of its PRC subsidiaries file income tax
returns in the United States and the PRC, respectively. The Company is subject
to U.S. federal income tax examination by tax authorities for tax years
beginning in 2007. According to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law,
the statute of limitations is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to
computational errors made by the taxpayer or the withholding agent. The statute
of limitations is extended to five years under special circumstances where the
underpayment of taxes is more than RMB100,000 ($15,000). In the case of transfer
pricing issues, the statute of limitations is ten years. There is no statute of
limitations in the case of tax evasion. The PRC tax returns for the Company&#146;s
PRC subsidiaries are open to examination by the PRC tax authorities for the tax
years beginning in 2005. </P>

<P align=justify>On June 5, 2009, the Company entered into a securities purchase
agreement (the &#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;) with certain accredited investors (the
&#147;Investors&#148;), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Investors
3.8% Senior Secured Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$9,554,140 (the &#147;Notes&#148;) and warrants (the &#147;Warrants&#148; and together with the
Notes, the &#147;Subscribed Securities&#148;) to purchase up to 1,194,268 shares of common
stock of the Company (the &#147;Warrant Shares&#148; and together with the shares to be
converted in the Notes, the &#147;Underlying Securities&#148;). The transaction closed on
June 10, 2009. </P>
<P align=justify>The coupon rate of the Notes is 3.8% per annum (the &#147;Interest
Rate&#148;), payable from the closing until repayment, whether on maturity on June 5,
2011, by acceleration or otherwise. Interest on the Notes is due and payable in
cash semi-annually on September 30 and March 31 of each year, commencing on
September 30, 2009. The Company has the option to pay the interest due through
the issuance of its common stock at a conversion price of $4.00 per share. If
the Company defaults in the payment of the principal or interest on the Notes
when due, subject to the Investors&#146; election, the Company is obligated to either
(a) redeem all or a portion of the Notes pursuant to the redemption rights
discussed below or (b) pay interest on such defaulted amount at a rate equal to
the Interest Rate plus 2.0% . The Notes are convertible at any time before
maturity into the Company&#146;s common stock at a conversion price of $4.00 per
share, subject to certain adjustments as specified in the Purchase Agreement. </P>
<P align=justify>The Warrants have a term of 3 years, with an exercise price of
$4.80 per share, subject to adjustments as provided in the Warrants, from time
to time pursuant to anti-dilution and other customary provisions, and are
exercisable by the Investors at any time after the date on which their related
Notes are converted, except that if any of the Notes is partially converted, the
Investors could only exercise the corresponding portion of the Warrants. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company has granted the Investors demand and piggy-back
registration rights with respect to the Underlying Securities, pursuant to a
registration rights agreement among the Company and the Investors. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company paid its placement agent a cash fee, representing
6.1% of the proceeds received in connection with the issuance of the Notes, in
addition to a 3-year warrant to purchase 93,750 shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock with an exercise price of $6.00 per share. The aggregate fee of $870,417
paid to the placement agent, including the fair value of the warrant issued, was
deferred and amortized over the life of the Notes. </P>
<P align=justify>The Notes are secured by 3,000,000 shares of common stock of
the Company held by Siu Ling Chan (&#147;Ms. Chan&#148;), the Company&#146;s board of directors
chairwoman and a principal shareholder of the Company, pursuant to the terms of
a Guarantee and Pledge Agreement signed among the Company, the Investors and Ms.
Chan. To induce Ms. Chan to enter into the Guarantee and Pledge Agreement with
the Investors, the Company agreed to indemnify Ms. Chan for all damages,
liabilities, losses and expenses of any kind (&#147;Losses&#148;), which may be sustained
or suffered by Ms. Chan, arising out of or in connection with any enforcement
action instituted by the Investors pursuant to the Guarantee and Pledge
Agreement. The Company&#146;s indemnification obligation is limited to Losses that
arise as the result of any negligent or unlawful conduct of the Company that is
caused unilaterally by the Company and is beyond Ms. Chan&#146;s control in her
capacity as a director of the Company, and will not exceed the market value of
the pledged shares as of the closing of the transaction. On December 22, 2009,
two of the Company&#146;s Notes holders converted $1,000,000 of their Notes into an
aggregate of 250,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. On January 13, 2010,
these two Notes holders converted an additional $1,054,140 of their remaining
Notes into an aggregate of 263,535 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. On
November 10, 2010, another Notes holder converted $2,800,000 of Notes into an
aggregate of 700,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. As of December 31,
2010, Notes in the principal amount of $4,700,000 was outstanding. </P>
<P align=justify>The terms of the Notes and Warrants include price adjustment
provisions under which the conversion price for the Notes and the exercise price
for the Warrants could be affected by future equity offerings undertaken by the
Company. As a result, the embedded conversion option in the Notes and Warrants
are not considered indexed to the Company&#146;s own stock, and therefore accounted
for as derivatives. The economic characteristics and risks of the embedded
conversion option in the Notes are not considered clearly and closely related to
the economic characteristics and risks of the host debt contract. The embedded
conversion option in the Notes met all of the characteristics of a derivative
instrument pursuant to ASC Subtopic 815-10. In accordance with ASC Subtopic
815-15, the embedded conversion option in the Notes was separated from the host
debt contract and accounted for as a derivative.</P>

<P align=justify>Total principal of the Notes in the amount of $9,554,140 was
first allocated to the embedded conversion option in the Notes and to the
Warrants based on their fair value on the issuance date of $6,552,505 and
$3,826,896, respectively. As a result, the Company recognized an initial charge
to income of $825,261 (see Note 14) for the amount by which the fair value of
these liabilities exceeded the face amount of the Notes for the year ended
December 31, 2009. All changes in the fair value of the embedded conversion option in the Notes and Warrants are
recognized in the statements of income until such time as the Notes are
converted or redeemed and Warrants are exercised or expired.</P>
<P align=justify>The residual amount is allocated to the debt instrument in the
amount of $0.01 and is accreted to the principal amount of the Notes using an
effective annual interest rate of approximately 365% with the related interest
expense recognized in the statements of income. Interest expense is expected to
be $3,580,167 for the year ended December 31, 2011. </P>
<P align=justify>The fair value of the embedded conversion option in the Notes
of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was determined based on the Binominal option
pricing model, using the following key assumptions: </P>

per share (the &#147;2006 Warrants&#148;). The warrants have a 5-year term and are
callable by the Company if the shares trade at 160% of the exercise price for 15
consecutive trading days. On July 28, 2006, the Company issued additional
warrants to purchase 214,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at an exercise
price of $2.8425 to a placement agent (the &#147;Placement Agent Warrants&#148;). These
warrants have a 5-year term and are non-callable. As a result of adopting ASC
815-40, &#147;<I>Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed
to an Entity's Own Stock&#148;</I> (&#147;ASC 815-40&#148;), effective January 1, 2009, both of
the 2006 Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants which were previously equity
classified were no longer equity classified because the exercise price of these
warrants are denominated in US dollar, a currency other than the Company&#146;s
functional currency, Renminbi. In addition, the terms of the 2006 Warrants
include a &#147;down-round&#148; provision under which the exercise price could be
affected by future equity offerings undertaken by the Company. As a result,
these warrants are not considered indexed to the Company&#146;s own stock, and as
such, are liability classified. All future changes in the fair value of these
warrants are recognized in earnings until such time as the warrants are
exercised or expired. As of January 1, 2009, the Company reclassified the
original fair value of these warrants of $600,289 from additional paid-in
capital to derivative liabilities, as if these warrants were treated as a
derivative liability since their date of issuance in July 2006. In addition, the
Company reclassified $393,962 from beginning retained earnings as of January 1,
2009 to derivative liabilities to recognize the change in fair value of 2006
Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants from the date of issuance to January 1,
2009. The cumulative-effect adjustment is the difference between the amounts
recognized in the statement of financial position before initial application of
ASC 815-40, and the amounts recognized in the statement of financial position at
initial application of ASC 815-40. The amounts recognized in the statement of
financial position as a result of the initial application of ASC 815-40 shall be
determined based on the amounts that would have been recognized if the guidance
in ASC 815-40 had been applied from the issuance date of the warrant. All of the
2006 Warrants and Placement Agent Warrants were exercised into the Company&#146;s
common stock during the year ended December 31, 2009. </P>
<P align=justify>In connection with the issuance of the Notes (see Note 13), the
Company issued warrants to purchase up to 1,194,268 and 93,750 shares of common
stock of the Company to the Investors and placement agent, respectively. During
the year ended December 31, 2010, warrants to purchase 256,768 and 93,750 shares
of common stock of the Company were exercised by the Investors and placement
agent, respectively. At the time of the exercises, the fair value of the warrant
derivative liabilities of $3,045,704 was transferred to additional paid-in
capital. </P>

<P align=justify>The volatility of the Company&#146;s common stock was estimated by
management based on the historical volatility of the Company&#146;s common stock. The
risk free interest rate was based on Treasury Constant Maturity Rates published
by the U.S. Federal Reserve for periods applicable to the estimated term of the
options. The expected dividend yield was based on the Company&#146;s current and
expected dividend policy. Changes in the management&#146;s estimates and assumptions
regarding the expected volatility and valuation of the Company&#146;s common stock
could significantly impact the estimated fair values of the share options
determined under the Black-Scholes option pricing model and, as a result, the
net income and the net income attributable to the Company&#146;s stockholders. The
weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the year of
2010 was $10.70. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $386,332 and $437,474, respectively. For
the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded stock
compensation expense of $2,341,783 and $62,281, respectively, in general and
administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $8,799,015 of
stock compensation expense with respect to non-vested stock-based awards is to
be recognized over approximately 2.5 years. The options activity is as follows: </P>

<P align=justify><B>NOTE 16 &#150; STATUTORY RESERVES</B> </P>
<P align=justify>The Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries are required to allocate at
least 10% of its after tax profits as determined under generally accepted
accounting principal in the PRC to its statutory surplus reserve until the
reserve balance reaches 50% of respective registered capital. The accumulated
balance of the statutory reserve as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was
$28,820,686 and $17,414,769, respectively. </P>
<P align=justify><B>NOTE 17 &#150; BUSINESS COMBINATION </B></P>
<P align=justify>On September 26, 2008, the Company entered into an equity
purchase agreement with Dalin, an investment holding company, and certain equity
owners of Dalin (&#147;Equity Owners of Dalin&#148;), to purchase 90% equity interest in
Dalin, for cash consideration of RMB194,400,000 (approximately $28.9 million)
(&#147;Consideration&#148;), payable in four installments. Dalin in turns held a 54%
equity interest in Qianfeng and subsequently renamed as Guizhou Taibang on
December 30, 2010. Pursuant to the equity purchase agreement (i) if the Company
pays RMB 174,960,000 (approximately $25.6 million), representing 90% of the
Consideration, on or before April 7, 2009, the Company will be entitled to share
Dalin&#146;s portion of the profit generated by Qianfeng starting from January 1,
2009, and (ii) if the Company fails to pay RMB174,960,000 on or before April 7,
2009, the profit generated by Qianfeng from January 1, 2009 until the day of
payment of RMB174,960,000 will be shared by the Company and the Equity Owners of
Dalin on a proportionate basis. In addition, the final installment, representing
the 10% of the Consideration, should be paid on or before April 9, 2010 with
interest accruing at 5.31% per annum. </P>
<P align=justify>The Company initiated payment of the third installment of the
Consideration on April 7, 2009, in accordance with the instructions provided by
Equity Owners of Dalin, which was subsequently paid on April 8 and April 14,
2009. The payment was deemed by Equity Owners of Dalin that the Company
fulfilled its obligations under the equity purchase agreement. As a result, the
Company was entitled to all the rights and privileges of a 90% shareholder in
Dalin, including the right to receive its pro rata share of the profits
generated by Dalin's 54% owned subsidiary, Qianfeng, since January 1, 2009,
subject to a possible dilution to as low as 41.3%, if potential investors of
Qianfeng prevail in a lawsuit to obtain additional equity interests in Qianfeng,
or to 52.45%, if the Company decides to ratify a dissenting Qianfeng
shareholder&#146;s request to register its additional capital infusion (see Note 20).
The Company paid a substantial portion of the final installment, representing
10% of the Consideration, on April 9, 2010. The remaining balance as of December
31, 2010 was $71,496. </P>
<P align=justify>According to the equity purchase agreement, as amended, the
Company can exercise its shareholder's rights, as well as to take control over
all the corporate seals and license of Dalin upon the payment of the second
installment, which was paid by the Company on December 14, 2008. However,
Dalin's related voting power over its subsidiary, Qianfeng, was not transferred
to the Company until the Company's nominees gained control of the board of
directors and the management positions of Qianfeng on January 16, 2009. The
Company's four nominees were elected to Qianfeng's seven-member Board of
Directors in a special meeting on January 16, 2009. In addition, on the same
date, Qianfeng's Board of Directors elected a new management team consisting of
all Company&#146;s appointees, including Chief Executive Officer, Executive Senior
Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director of Sales. Therefore, the
Company believes that January 16, 2009, the date on which the Company legally
obtained control, acquired the assets, assumed the liabilities and became
entitled to Dalin's share of the profit generated by Qianfeng, as the
acquisition date. The results of Dalin's and its subsidiaries' operations from
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 are included in the Company's
consolidated statements of income and stockholders&#146; equity and comprehensive
income.</P>

<P align=justify>The Company determined the fair values primarily based on the
evaluation report prepared by an independent appraisal. The fair values of the
assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest were primarily
estimated using a combination of income approach, cost approach and market
approach valuation techniques. A goodwill of $17.2 million, representing the
excess of the consideration and fair value of noncontrolling interest over the
fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, was recognized
at the acquisition date. The goodwill is mainly for the synergies and cost
reduction expected to be achieved. The acquired goodwill is not deductible for
tax purposes. The transaction costs of the acquisition were not material, and
have been recorded in general and administrative expenses. </P>
<P align=justify><B>NOTE 18 &#150; FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS </B></P>
<P align=justify>Management used the following methods and assumptions to
estimate the fair value of financial instruments at the relevant balance sheet
dates: </P>
<ul>
  <li>
<P align=justify style="margin-bottom: 12">Short-term financial instruments (including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivables, other receivables, short-term loans, accounts
payable, other payables and accrued expenses, accrued interest, and amounts due
to related parties) &#150; The carrying amounts of the short-term financial
instruments approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments. </P>
  </li>
  <li>
<P align=justify style="margin-bottom: 12">Long-term other payable &#150; The fair value of the Company&#146;s
long-term other payable is estimated by discounting future cash flows using
current market interest rates offered to the Company and its subsidiaries for
debts with substantially the same characteristics and maturities. </P>
  </li>
  <li>
<P align=justify>Derivative liabilities (the embedded conversion option in the
Notes and Warrants) &#150; The estimated fair values were determined by using
Binominal Option Pricing Model with Level 2 inputs. The following table sets
forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Company&#146;s financial
instruments that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December

<P align=justify><U>Legal proceedings</U> </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Bobai County Collection Station</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In January 2007, the Company's PRC subsidiary, Shandong
Taibang, advanced $413,697 (RMB3.0 million) to Feng Lin, the 20% minority
shareholder of Fang Cheng Plasma Company, a Company's majority owned subsidiary,
for the purpose of establishing or acquiring a plasma collection station. Mr.
Lin and Shandong Taibang intended to establish the Bobai Kangan Plasma
Collection Co., Ltd. (&#147;Bobai&#148;) in Bobai County, Guangxi. On January 18, 2007,
Shandong Taibang signed a letter of intent to acquire the assets of the Bobai
Plasma Collection Station, which was co-owned by Mr. Lin and Mr. Keliang Huang.
However, in January 2007, Hua Lan Biological Engineering Co., Ltd. (&#147;Hua Lan&#148;)
filed suit in the District Court of Hong Qi District, Xin Xiang City, Henan
Province, alleging that Feng Lin, Keliang Huang and Shandong Taibang established
and/or sought to operate the Bobai Plasma Collection Station using a permit for
collecting and supplying human plasma in Bobai County, that was originally
granted to Hua Lan by the government of the Guangxi region, without Hua Lan's
permission. The establishment and registration of Bobai was never realized as a
result of this law suit. On January 29, 2007, on Hua Lan's motion, the District
Court entered an order to freeze funds in the amount of approximately $386,100
(RMB3,000,000) held by the defendants in the case, including approximately
$65,750 (RMB500,000) in funds held in Shandong Taibang's bank account in Tai'an
City. A hearing was held on June 25, 2007 and judgment was entered against the
defendants along with a $226,780 (RMB1,700,000) joint financial judgment. The
Company appealed the District Court judgment to the Xinxiang City Intermediate
Court. In November 2007, the Intermediate Court affirmed the judgment against
the three defendants and increased the amount of the joint financial judgment to
approximately $405,954 (RMB3,000,000).</P>
<P align=justify>In January 2008, Hua Lan enforced the judgment granted by the
Intermediate Court to freeze the Company's bank accounts. Shandong Taibang filed
a separate action against Hua Lan before the Tai'an City District Court to seek
recovery of any losses in connection with Hua Lan's claim and to request that
the Tai'an City District Court preserve Hua Lan's property or freeze up to
approximately $411,300 (RMB 3 million) of Hua Lan's assets to secure the return
of such funds to the Company. The intermediate court in Tai'an City accepted the
application on February 14, 2008 but the matter is still pending. Pending the
outcome of the proceedings, Shandong Taibang increased its loss contingency
reserve during its fourth quarter of 2007 from approximately $75,593
(RMB566,667) to $133,400 (RMB1,000,000) to cover its share of the enforcement of
this judgment. During the fourth quarter of 2008, full amount of the judgment,
including Feng Lin and Keliang Huang's portions of the judgment and the related
fees, of approximately $456,222 (RMB3,109,900) was withdrawn from Shandong
Taibang's account. The Company recorded Feng Lin and Keliang Huang's portion of
the judgment, of approximately $304,143 (RMB2,073,234), as receivable as a
result of the withdrawal. As of December 31, 2008, the Company determined that
it is unlikely that the Company will be able to recover such receivable from
those two individuals and wrote off the receivable as bad debt expense. In
January 2010, Feng Lin transferred his 20% equity in Fang Cheng Plasma Company
as a repayment for such receivable he owed to the Company. As a result, the
Company is now the 100% owner of the Fang Cheng Plasma Company. </P>
<P align=justify>In October 2009, Shandong Taibang appealed to the High Court of
Henan Province requesting the court to reverse judgments from the Hong Qi
District Court based on Shandong Taibang's belief that Hua Lan&#146;s involvement in
Bobai was in violation of PRC Blood Products Regulations since Hua Lan did not
invest, as Shandong Taibang did, in Bobai as required by the Regulation. The
Company is awaiting the judgment of the Henan High Court as of the date of this
report. In light of the foregoing, it is unlikely that the Company's plan
acquisition of the assets of Bobai will go forward.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Dispute among Guizhou Taibang Shareholders over Raising
Additional Capital</I></B> </P>
<P align=justify>On May 28, 2007, a 91% majority of Guizhou Taibang's
shareholders approved a plan to raise additional capital from private strategic
investors through the issuance of an additional 20,000,000 shares of Guizhou
Taibang equity interests at RMB2.80 per share. The plan required all existing
Guizhou Taibang shareholders to waive their rights of first refusal to subscribe
for the additional shares. The remaining 9% minority holder of Guizhou Taibang's
shares, the Guizhou Jie'an Company, or Jie'an, did not support the plan and did
not agree to waive its right of first refusal. On May 29, 2007, the majority
shareholders caused Guizhou Taibang to sign an Equity Purchase Agreement with
certain investors, pursuant to which the investors agreed to invest an aggregate
of RMB50,960,000 (approximately $7,475,832) in exchange for 18,200,000 shares,
or 21.4%, of Guizhou Taibang's equity interests. At the same time, Jie'an also
subscribed for 1,800,000 shares, representing its 9% pro rata share of the
20,000,000 shares being offered. The proceeds from all parties were received by
Guizhou Taibang in accordance with the agreement.</P>
<P align=justify>In June 2007, Jie'an brought suit in the High Court of Guizhou
province, China, against Guizhou Taibang and the three other original Guizhou
Taibang shareholders, alleging the illegality of the Equity Purchase Agreement.
In its complaint, Jie'an alleged that it had a right to acquire the shares
waived by the original Guizhou Taibang shareholders and offered to the investors
in connection with the Equity Purchase Agreement. On September 12, 2008, the
Guizhou High Court ruled against Jie'an and sustained the Equity Purchase
Agreement. On November 2008, Jie'an appealed the Guizhou High Court judgment to
the People's Supreme Court in Beijing. On May 13, 2009, the People's Supreme
Court sustained the original ruling and denied the rights of first refusal of
Jie'an over the additional shares waived by the original Guizhou Taibang's
shareholders. The registration of the new investors as Guizhou Taibang's
shareholders and the related increase in registered capital of Guizhou Taibang
with the Administration for Industry and Commerce are still pending. On January
27, 2010, the strategic investors brought suit in the High Court of Guizhou
Province against Guizhou Taibang alleging Guizhou Taibang&#146;s failure to register
their equity interest in Guizhou Taibang with the local Administration for
Industry and Commerce (&#147;AIC&#148;) and requesting the distribution of their share of Guizhou Taibang&#146;s dividends. Dalin was also joined as
a co-defendant as it is the majority shareholder and exercises control over
Guizhou Taibang&#146;s day-to-day operations. The Company does not expect the
strategic investors to prevail because, upon evaluation of the Equity Purchase
Agreement, the Company believes that the Equity Purchase Agreement is void due
to certain invalid pre-conditions and the absence of shareholder authorization
of the initial investment. In the event that Guizhou Taibang is required to
return their original investment amount to the strategic investors, Guizhou
Taibang has set aside the strategic investors&#146; initial fund along with
RMB10,056,242 (approximately $1,525,532) in accrued interest, and RMB509,600
(approximately $77,306) for the 1% penalty imposed by the agreement for any
breach as of December 31, 2010. If strategic investors prevail in their suit,
Dalin's interests in Guizhou Taibang could be reduced to approximately 41.3% .
The High Court of Guizhou heard the case on April 8, 2010 and encouraged, and
accepted by both parties, to settle the dispute outside the court but both
parties failed to reach a mutual agreeable term.</P>

<P align=justify>On October 14, 2010, the High Court of Guizhou ruled in favor
of the Company and denied the strategic investors&#146; right as shareholders of
Guizhou Taibang, as well as their entitlement to the dividends. On October 26,
2010, the strategic investors appealed to, and subsequently accepted by, the PRC
Superior Court in Beijing on the ruling. As of the date of this report, the
Company is waiting to hear the ruling from the Court.</P>
<P align=justify>During the second quarter of 2010, Jie&#146;an requested that
Guizhou Taibang register its 1.8 million shares of additional capital infusion
with the local AIC, pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, and such request
was approved by the majority shareholders of Guizhou Taibang in a shareholders
meeting held in the second quarter of 2010. However, the Board of Directors of
the Company is withholding its required ratification of the shareholders&#146;
approval of Jie&#146;an&#146;s request until the outcome of the ongoing litigations. If
the Company decides to ratify the approval, Dalin&#146;s ownership in Guizhou Taibang
will be diluted from 54% to 52.54% and Jie&#146;an may be entitled to receive its pro
rata share of Guizhou Taibang&#146;s profits from the prior 2 years.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Dispute over Guizhou Taibang Technical Consulting
Agreement </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In 1997, Guizhou Taibang entered into a Technical Cooperation
Agreement with Sin Kyung Ye, or Sin, a Korean individual, to provide certain
fractionation equipment and transfer processing know-how to Guizhou Taibang. In
August 2004, Sin filed a law suit against Guizhou Taibang with the Intermediate
Court in Guiyang City, China, alleging non-payment of RMB100,000 (approximately
$14,670) for his fractionation equipment and RMB5,000,000 (approximately
$733,500) for the transfer of his technological know-how. The Intermediate Court
ruled in favor of Sin and found that Guizhou Taibang owed Sin RMB10,376,160
(approximately $1,522,183). Guizhou Taibang appealed the Intermediate Court
ruling to the Guizhou High Court. The Guizhou High Court agreed in part with
Guizhou Taibang's grounds for appeal and reduced the amount of know-how transfer
fee to RMB1,970,413 (approximately $289,060). In May 2007, Sin appealed the
Guizhou High Court's decision to the People's Supreme Court in Beijing. The
People's Supreme Court heard the case in April 2008 and ruled on December 29,
2009 for Guizhou Taibang to pay RMB4,700,000 (approximately $689,490) as
compensation to Sin for technology transfer and RMB100,000 (approximately,
$14,670) for unpaid equipment purchase. In December 2010, Sin filed another law
suit against Guizhou Taibang with the Guizhou High Court for additional
compensation of RMB5,376,160 (USD815,563). The Guizhou High Court ruled in favor
of Sin and ruled on December 7, 2010 for Guizhou Taibang to pay the additional
compensation. Guizhou Taibang has accrued and accounted for all these expenses
as of December 31, 2010 and subsequently paid the judgment in full as of the
date of this report. </P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Guizhou Taibang's Guarantee to a Third Party </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>In 2007, as a condition to purchase Huang Ping Plasma Station,
Guizhou Taibang entered into an agreement with Guizhou Zhongxin Investment
Company, or Zhongxin, in which Guizhou Taibang agreed to repay Zhongxin's debt
out of Guizhou Taibang's payables to Zhongxin arising from plasma purchased from
Zhongxin. In the same agreement, Guizhou Taibang also delivered a guarantee to
the Huang Ping County Hospital, the former co-owner of the Huang Ping Plasma
Station, that it would pay RMB3,074,342 (approximately, $451,006) in debt that
Zhongxin owed to the hospital. On June 1, 2009, Huang Ping Hospital brought
suit, in the Huang Ping County People's Court of Guizhou Province, against
Zhongxin for non-payment of its payables and debt due to Huang Ping Hospital and
against Guizhou Taibang as the guarantor. On November 2, 2009, the court ruled
in favor of the plaintiff and Guizhou Taibang as the guarantor became obligated
to repay the Zhongxin&#146;s debt to the Huang Ping Hospital on behalf of Zhongxin.
In October 2009, Guizhou Taibang appealed to the Middle Court of Kaili District
in Guizhou Province which sustained the original judgment on April 8, 2010.
Under the Equity Transfer Agreement pursuant to which we acquired a 90% interest
in Dalin, Guizhou Taibang's majority shareholder, provides that the sellers will
be responsible, based on their pro rata equity interest in Guizhou Taibang, for
damages incurred by Guizhou Taibang from Zhongxin's debt and that they will
repay Dalin their pro rata share of payments made by Guizhou Taibang to
creditors in connection with Zhongxin's debt within 10 days after payment by
Guizhou Taibang. The RMB3,074,342 contingent liability and proportionate share
of the liability to be recovered from the sellers were properly reflected in the
financials as of December 31, 2009. On December 31, 2010, Guizhou Taibang
brought suit against Zhongxin in the Middle Court of Guiyang City, to recover
the full judgment amount of RMB3,074,342 plus court fee of RMB32,340 that
Guizhou Taibang has already paid on behalf of Zhongxin.</P>
<P align=justify>On September 13, 2010, Zhongxin countersued the Company for a
consideration of RMB500,000 (approximately $74,850) for the alleged loss of its
share of income from the Huang Ping Plasma Station since the Company acquired
the station in April 2007. The Company believes Zhongxin&#146;s claim is unwarranted since the
Company acquired the station from its rightful owner, the Treasury Department of
Huangpin County, Guizhou Province.</P>

<P align=justify><B><I>Shandong Taibang Equity Interests </I></B></P>
<P align=justify>Mr. Zu Ying Du was one of the original equity holders in the
Company&#146;s operating subsidiary, Shandong Taibang. Pursuant to a joint venture
agreement, among the original equity holders, Mr. Du was obligated to make a
capital contribution of RMB 20 million (or approximately $2.6 million) for a 25%
interest in Shandong Taibang. Mr. Du made this contribution using funds borrowed
from the Beijing Chen Da Technology Investment Company, or Beijing Chen Da. Mr.
Du failed to repay Beijing Chen Da for his loan of the capital contribution
amount. Mr. Du disputes that the money was due and owing. A Beijing court found
that Beijing Chen Da had given money to Mr. Du but found that the loan agreement
failed to comply with Chinese law. A notice was issued on July 5, 2004 by the
Shenzhen Public Security Bureau Economic Crime Investigation Unit requesting a
stay of the Beijing action pending their investigation into money laundering
relating to the 20 million RMB loan to Zu Ying Du. </P>
<P align=justify>Subsequently, Beijing Chen Da entered into an equity transfer
agreement with Mr. Du, pursuant to which Mr. Du's 25% equity interest in
Shandong Taibang was transferred to Beijing Chen Da as repayment of the RMB 20
million debt. This agreement was signed by Mr. Du's brother who held a power of
attorney from Mr. Du. Mr. Du disputes the legitimacy of this transfer and has
argued that his brother, Du Hai Shan, exceeded the scope of the power of
attorney. Mr. Du sued his brother in the court of Jianli County, Hubei province,
relating to the propriety of the brother's actions under the power of attorney.
Initially the county court found in its judgment that the act had exceeded the
scope of the power of attorney. Subsequently the Intermediate Court of Jingzhou
City, Hubei province, ruled on December 10, 2008 to suspend the judgment based
on the grounds that the original court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The
case is slated to be reviewed again by the Hubei Jingzhou Intermediate Court.
</P>
<P align=justify>Missile Engineering, another original equity holder wholly
controlled by Mr. Du, was obligated to contribute RMB 32.8 million (or $4.2
million) for a 41% interest in Shandong Taibang by means of cash, equipment and
patent technology. It was obligated to obtain new drug certificate and
production license of its patent technology from the government within a
stipulated period in order to be recognized as a valid capital contribution, or
in the alternative, make a cash payment. The patent technology was valued as RMB
26.4 million (or approximately $3.4 million). However, Missile Engineering
failed to obtain the new drug certificate and production license within the
stipulated period. Mr. Du also disputed whether the period for obtaining the
certificate and license had expired. Pursuant to a stockholders resolution on
September 26, 2004, Missile Engineering agreed to sell its 41% interest in
Shandong Taibang to Up-Wing Investments Limited (&#147;Up-Wing&#148;) and Up-Wing agreed
to take up the obligation of Missile Engineering to pay the RMB 26.4 million in
cash. Missile Engineering disputed this transaction and sued the brother of Mr.
Du in the court of Jianli County, Hubei province, relating to the propriety of
the brother's actions under the power of attorney. Initially the county court
found in its judgment that the act had exceeded the scope of the power of
attorney. Subsequently the Intermediate Court of Jingzhou City, Hubei province,
ruled on December 10, 2008 to suspend the judgment based on the grounds that the
original court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The case is slated to be
reviewed again by the Hubei Jingzhou Intermediate Court. </P>
<P align=justify>In June 10, 2005, Beijing Chen Da also sold its equity interest
in Shandong Taibang to Up-Wing Investments Limited, or Up-Wing, pursuant to a
share transfer agreement, which became effective on September 2, 2005, upon
approval by the Shandong Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC. In March 2006, Up-Wing sold its equity
interests in Shandong Taibang to Logic Express, the Company&#146;s subsidiary. </P>
<P align=justify>In 2006, Missile Engineering applied for arbitration before the
China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, or CIETAC, to
challenge the effectiveness of the transfer to Up-Wing Investments Limited, of
the equity interests in Shandong Taibang formerly owned by Missile Engineering.
The equity transfer had been approved by the Shandong Provincial Department of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, or the Shandong COFTEC. Missile
Engineering later voluntarily withdrew this application and instead applied for
administrative reconsideration of the equity transfer, but this application was
rejected by the Ministry of Commerce in 2007. Missile Engineering applied with
the District Court of Lixia District, Jinan City, Shandong province requesting
revocation of Shandong COFTEC's approval of the equity transfer to Up-wing by
Missile Engineering. Missile Engineering later voluntarily withdrew the action.
In April 2007, Logic Express initiated an arbitration proceeding before the
Shandong Tai'an Arbitration Committee, to establish that Logic Express is the
lawful shareholder of Shandong Taibang. The parties to that proceeding were
Logic Express Ltd. and Shandong Taibang Biological Products Co., Ltd. The
Arbitration Committee's decision on September 6, 2007 confirmed that Logic
Express had legitimate ownership as a result of the transfer of Shandong
Taibang. Up-Wing started an action in the Intermediate Court of Tai'an City,
Shandong province requesting the court to establish that Up-Wing is the lawful
shareholder of Shandong Taibang. The Intermediate Court of Tai'an City, Shandong
province on December 20, 2007 rejected the application on the basis that the
same matter had been tried by the arbitration panel. </P>
<P align=justify>Up-Wing filed a defamation case in the District Court of
Hi-technology and Industry Development District, Tai'an City, Shandong province
claiming defamation against Mr. Du and the 21<SUP>st</SUP> Century Economic
Report Newspaper. Judgment in favor of Up-Wing was rendered on July 22, 2008
ordering the newspaper and Mr. Du to publish an apology to Up-Wing. </P>

<P align=justify>Mr. Du and Missile Engineering subsequently filed two actions
in the Intermediate Court of Wuhan City, Hubei province, against Du Hai Shan,
his brother, Beijing Chen Da and Logic Express, requesting that the court
restore the equity interests originally held by the plaintiffs, 25% equity
interest held by Mr. Du and 41% equity interest held by Missile Engineering and
the court issued a preliminary order attaching 66% of the equity of Shandong
Taibang pending the outcome of the case. On September 25, 2009, the Higher
People's Court of Hubei overruled the Wuhan Intermediate Court's acceptance of
jurisdiction over the case and ruled that the Tai'an Intermediate Court in
Shandong Province, where the Company is located, had the proper jurisdiction
over the parties' dispute. The court ruled that while the plaintiffs had the
right to bring a lawsuit for the validity of the share transfer agreement
because they did not attend the previous arbitration hearing and never reached
an arbitration agreement regarding their dispute, the Tai'an Intermediate Court
has the proper jurisdiction over the dispute pursuant to the prior agreement of
the parties. As a result, the attached 66% of the equity of Shandong Taibang was
released back to Logic Express. On November 17, 2009, the Wuhan Intermediate
Court permitted Mr. Du and Missile Engineering to withdraw their suits against
Logic Express and the other defendants.</P>
<P align=justify>On December 31, 2010, the Company received a Notice from the
PRC Supreme Court, advising the Company that the PRC Supreme Court has accepted
an appeal for judicial review of the Hubei High Court ruling dismissing case.
The Company has submitted its counter-argument and related material to the PRC
Supreme Court on November 2, 2010 and the PRC Supreme Court ruled in favor of
the Company on November 30, 2010 and denied Mr. Du and Missile Engineering&#146;s
appeal to the ruling of Wuhan Intermediate Court.</P>
<P align=justify><B><I>Dispute over Raw Plasma Supply Agreement with Xintai
</I></B></P>
<P align=justify>On March 10, 2009, Henan Xintai Medicine Company (previously
known as Henan Zhongtai Medicine, &#147;Xintai&#148;) brought suit against Shandong
Taibang and its two wholly-owned plasma collecting subsidiaries in Shandong for
breach of a raw plasma supply agreement. The suit was subsequently withdrawn by
Xintai on May 31, 2009. The agreement, signed by Shandong Taibang and Xintai on
October 10, 2006, requires the two subsidiaries to provide to Xintai 45 metric
tons of raw plasma per year from 2007 to 2009. The subsidiaries provided more
than 34 metric tons of plasma to Xintai during 2007. However, the Company ceased
its delivery of plasma to Xintai in late 2007 to avoid contravention of new PRC
regulation. Clause 43 of an October 31, 2007, PRC State Department Regulation on
Plasma Collection Stations, prohibits plasma collecting stations from providing
raw plasma to any manufacturer other than their direct parent (the
&#147;Regulation&#148;). On March 12, 2009, Shandong Taibang filed a suit in the Shandong
Tai'an Middle Court against Xintai seeking damages of RMB50,000 (approximately,
$7,335) for the plasma already supplied to Xintai during 2007. On June 29, 2009,
Xintai re-filed its suit in the Shandong Tai'an Middle Court against Shandong
Taibang and the two subsidiaries seeking compensation of RMB6,000,000
(approximately, $880,200) for alleged breach of contract and demanding that
Shandong Taibang and the subsidiaries continue to honor the agreement. On
October 20, 2009, the Tai'an Middle Court combined and heard the two suits and
ruled on January 20, 2010 in favor of Shandong Taibang on all accounts. </P>
<P align=justify>On February 17, 2010, Xintai appealed to the High Court of
Shandong Province and on August 10, 2010, the High Court remanded the suit to
the Tai&#146;an Middle Court for retrial on grounds of insufficient evidence.</P>
<P align=justify>On November 8, 2010, the Company and Xintai reached an out of
court settlement whereby Shandong Taibang agreed to pay Xintai RMB 4,000,000
(approximately $598,800), payable on or before November 22, 2010, and RMB 43,950
(approximately $6,430) in court costs. The Company has paid the costs of its
settlement agreement with Xintai under legal expenses as of December 31,
2010.</P>

Guizhou Eakan Co., Ltd. (&#147;Guizhou Eakan&#148;), the affiliate of one of the Guizhou
Taibang&#146;s noncontrolling interests holders. The Company&#146;s total processing
services income from Guizhou Eakan amounted to $499,128 and $705,018 for the
years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, Guizhou
Taibang made sales to Guizhou Eakan, amounting to $521,306, for the year ended
December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, accounts receivable due
from Guizhou Eakan amounted to $212,611 and $222,617, respectively. The
outstanding balance as of December 31, 2010 was settled in cash in January 2011.

<P align=justify><SUP>(2)</SUP> On April 6, 2009, Logic Express entered into an
agreement with Shandong Institute, the noncontrolling interest holders in
Shandong Taibang, pursuant to which, Shandong Institute would provide an advance
to assist Logic Express&#146;s purchase of 90% Dalin's equity interests (see Note
17). Under the terms of the agreement, Shandong Institute agreed to provide
advance of $3,652,500 (RMB25,000,000), representing 12.86% of the Company&#146;s
purchase consideration in Dalin to the Company for one year, bearing interest
equal to the higher of a proportionate share of the net income of Dalin during
the year ended December 31, 2009 or 6% per annum. On April 12, 2010, the Company
fully paid the advance from Shandong Institute and the interest of approximately
$1.3 million, which was less than the Company&#146;s previous estimate by
approximately $0.9 million. The Company recorded the difference between the
previous estimate and actual payment in other income of the consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2010.</P>
<P align=justify><SUP>(3)</SUP> Guizhou Taibang has payables to Guizhou Eakan
Investing Corp., amounting to approximately $2,195,123 (RMB14,470,160). Guizhou
Eakan Investing Corp. is one of the noncontrolling interest holders of the
Guizhou Taibang. The Company borrowed this interest free advance for working
capital purpose for Guizhou Taibang. The balance is due on demand. </P>
<P align=justify><SUP>(4)</SUP> Guizhou Taibang has payables to Guizhou Jie&#146;an,
a noncontrolling interest holder of Guizhou Taibang, amounting to approximately
$997,017 (RMB 6,569,840). In 2007, Guizhou Taibang received additional
contributions from Guizhou Jie&#146;an of $962,853 to maintain Jie&#146;an equity interest
in Guizhou Taibang at 9%. However, due to a legal dispute among shareholders
over raising additional capital as discussed in the legal proceeding section
(see note 20), the money may be returned to Jie&#146;an. During the second quarter of
2010, Jie&#146;an requested that Guizhou Taibang register its 1.8 million shares of
additional capital infusion with the local Administration for Industry and
Commerce, pursuant to the equity purchase agreement, and such registration was
approved by the majority shareholders of Guizhou Taibang in a shareholders
meeting held in the second quarter of 2010. However, the Board of Directors of
the Company is withholding its required ratification of the shareholders&#146;
approval of Jie&#146;an&#146;s request until the outcome of the ongoing litigations. If
the Company decided to ratify the approval, Dalin&#146;s ownership in Guizhou Taibang
will be diluted from 54% to 52.54% and Guizhou Jie&#146;an will be entitled to
receive its pro rata share of Guizhou Taibang&#146;s profits from the prior 2 years.

Company's business, financial condition and results of operations may be
influenced by the political, economic and legal environments in the PRC, and by
the general state of the PRC economy. The Company's results may be adversely
