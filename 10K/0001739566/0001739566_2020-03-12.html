industry and business characteristics. Key industry characteristics include stable long-term growth trends and industry fundamentals,
attractive competitive dynamics, opportunities to benefit from secular changes in consumer behavior (including shifting consumer
demographics, changing consumer shopping behaviors and evolving consumer preferences), limited &ldquo;fad&rdquo; or technological
disruption risks and potential consolidation opportunities. Key business characteristics include predictable and recurring revenues,
attractive market positions and competitive advantages, strong operating margins and free cash flow characteristics, opportunities

be made regardless of whether any Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders. The forward purchase securities

value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital

agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine
the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider
it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be
unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount
of uncertainty as to the value of the target&rsquo;s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development,
operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the
board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. As any such opinion,
if obtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material
information regarding the valuation of the target or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such
opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required by Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act, any proxy solicitation
materials or tender offer documents that we will file with the SEC in connection with our initial business combination will include
such opinion.</P>

our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire
100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination
such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order
to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business
combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or
otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of
the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction
company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction
in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this
case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number
of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding
shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business
or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or
acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one
target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We intend to focus
our search for a business combination target in the consumer goods industry and related sectors. We believe these areas represent
attractive segments of the economy in which to execute an initial business combination and generate attractive returns for our
shareholders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We believe there are
numerous founder- and privately-owned businesses in these sectors that could benefit from our active ownership, operating model
and capital to scale their businesses. We also believe that there may be opportunities to effectuate corporate carve-outs of non-core
businesses that could benefit from increased attention and investment under our ownership. We believe this opportunity is enhanced
by recent consolidation in the sector (which could fuel corporate divestures and portfolio rationalization) and recent reductions
to federal corporate tax rates (which may increase net proceeds to corporate sellers). We believe we represent an attractive business
combination alternative to owners in our target sectors given (a)&nbsp;the significant demand for equities by public market investors
who understand these sectors and often value the perceived stability and cash flow generation of consumer and related assets, (b)&nbsp;the
potential for well-run, diversified and scaled businesses to trade at a premium relative to potential private transaction values
for smaller consumer and related assets and (c)&nbsp;our potential to add significant value to target businesses through our management
team&rsquo;s experience and operational strategies. We also believe consumer goods and related sectors may present attractive returns
for investors during this stage in the economic cycle as our experience has shown that numerous sub-segments, such as consumer
staples, have historically exhibited limited cyclicality and resilience to economic recessions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Although we expect
the consumer goods industry and related sectors to offer an array of potential target businesses with relatively stable and recurring
cash flows, the sector is undergoing a number of fundamental changes which we believe will impact relative growth rates and performance
going forward. These changes include shifting consumer demographics (including an increase in ethnic diversity, the aging of baby
boomers, and the transition of millennials into prime spending years), changing consumer shopping behaviors (including the increased
use of technology by consumers to research and purchase consumer goods and by brand owners to cost-effectively communicate with
consumers) and evolving consumer preferences (including an increased focus on health and wellness, an expanding appeal for customized,
authentic or local products, a growing focus on social responsibility, a shift of consumer spending toward experiences and the
bifurcation of spending into premium and value purchases). The retail segment is also experiencing significant change, including
disruption of substantial portions of the industry by technology and direct-to-consumer distribution models.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We intend to focus
our search for a business combination target on fundamentally sound businesses that we believe have a competitive advantage, can
be industry leaders, can scale rapidly, can capitalize on one or more of the above trends, and where there is substantial opportunity
for operational improvements. We intend to avoid target businesses experiencing or at significant risk of experiencing material
disruption to their businesses from technology, shifting consumer preferences or other factors.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We intend to focus
our search for a business combination target on businesses that can benefit from the industry knowledge and operational experience
of our management team and where we believe there are opportunities for operational improvements. We believe we can generate attractive
returns for our investors in relatively stable industry sub-sectors through implementation of our operational strategies focused
on enhancing organic growth, realizing supply chain efficiencies and streamlining costs and pursuing strategic acquisitions that
enhance the overall business profile and offer significant synergy opportunities. Our strategies to enhance organic growth may
include accelerating revenues of existing products through innovation, sales enhancements, improving returns on marketing investments,
optimizing promotional spending, or other process improvements. They may also include expanding revenues via new product offerings
or expansion into new channels of distribution or geographic areas. Our strategies to realize supply chain efficiencies and streamline
costs may include implementation of company-wide productivity programs (including &ldquo;LEAN&rdquo; or similar initiatives), investments
in technology or equipment, optimization of procurement (including through e-auctions and other tools), reducing distribution costs
(including through use of technology and software tools), and refinements to organizational structure, reporting layers, spans
of control and other variables. We also intend to evaluate strategic follow-on acquisitions that may accelerate our revenue growth,
enhance our market position or generate meaningful cost synergies. We believe the effective implementation of the above strategies
has the potential to meaningfully accelerate earnings growth of a target business. Our experience has shown such improved performance
can also result in public market investors or potential acquirers valuing the company at a higher multiple of earnings or cash
flows, further enhancing shareholder returns. While there can be no guarantees we will identify a target where each or any of these
strategies is applicable or that we will effectively implement these strategies, we believe our management&rsquo;s experience pursuing
similar strategies will be attractive to potential sellers, management teams and our shareholders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We believe our structure
makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business
an alternative to a traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination
transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business
for our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares
and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find
this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than a typical initial public offering. The
typical initial public offering process can take a significantly longer period of time than a potential transaction with us, and
there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may
not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Furthermore, once
a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public
offering is always subject to the underwriters&rsquo; ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which
could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital,
an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders&rsquo; interests and the ability to use its
shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&rsquo;s profile
among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">While we believe that
our structure and our management team&rsquo;s background makes us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses
may view our status as a special purpose acquisition company, including our lack of an operating history and our potential need
to seek shareholder approval of a proposed initial business combination, negatively.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We are an &ldquo;emerging
growth company,&rdquo; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &ldquo;JOBS Act&rdquo;). We will remain
an emerging growth company until the earlier of&thinsp;&thinsp; (1)&nbsp;the last day of the fiscal year (a)&nbsp;following the
fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b)&nbsp;in which we have total annual gross revenue of at
least $1.07&nbsp;billion, or (c)&nbsp;in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our
Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700&nbsp;million as of the prior June&nbsp;30, and (2)&nbsp;the
date on which we have issued more than $1.0&nbsp;billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.</P>

a &ldquo;smaller reporting company&rdquo; as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage
of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements.
We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary
shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during
such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior

2019, we had $451,020,841 in the trust account that we may use to complete our initial business combination (after payment of offering
costs, including the $15,450,000 in deferred underwriting commissions and deferred legal fees). We offer a target business a variety
of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations
or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination
using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient
combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However,
we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.</P>

otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management
determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder&rsquo;s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction,

closely the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination
with that business, our assessment of the target business&rsquo;s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future
management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role
of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination
as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial
business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following
our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our
initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience
or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.</P>

The redemption right will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised

on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold
in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&rsquo;s shares are not purchased
by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our
shareholders&rsquo; ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent,
we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete
our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">In connection with
any vote held to approve a proposed business combination, public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether
they are record holders or hold their shares in &ldquo;street&nbsp;name,&rdquo; will be required to either tender their certificates
(if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company&rsquo;s
DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&rsquo;s option, in each case no later than two business days prior
to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials,
as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate
the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption
right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have
from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior
to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek
to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for
shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">There is a nominal
cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through
the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up
to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether
or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement
of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.</P>

submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent at least two business days prior to the vote in which the name of
the beneficial owner of such shares is included.</P>

to have vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements
with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of
our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that
they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach
of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case
in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any
third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider
whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the company, and will only enter into an agreement with such third
party if management believes that such third party&rsquo;s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances.
Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third
party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other
consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute
a waiver. The underwriters of our initial public offering will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies
held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in
the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against
the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor agreed that it will be
liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target
business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination
agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of&thinsp; (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii)
the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than
$10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not
apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held
in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters
of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;). However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor
have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that
our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to
satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation,
claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</P>

and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of
these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target
businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing
the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise
their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants,
and the future dilution they potentially represent, or the possible need for us to conduct a shareholder vote to approve the transaction,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully

with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials,
as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled
to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may
acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance
with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that
any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared
in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial
statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not
be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we
do not believe that this limitation will be material.</P>

will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements on our internal control

our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its

$11.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of&thinsp;$35,000,000, or $10.00 per Class&nbsp;A ordinary share, in a private
placement to close concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. These purchases will be made regardless of
whether any Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders. The forward purchase securities will be issued
only in connection with the closing of the initial business combination. The proceeds from the sale of forward purchase securities
may be used to fund part of the consideration to the sellers in our initial business combination, expenses in connection with our
initial business combination or for working capital in the post-transaction company. However, if the sale of the forward purchase
securities does not close by reason of the failure by some or all of our sponsor or independent directors to fund the purchase
price for their forward purchase securities, for example, we may lack sufficient funds to consummate our initial business combination.
Additionally, our sponsor&rsquo;s and independent directors&rsquo; obligations to purchase the forward purchase securities are
subject to termination prior to the closing of the sale of the forward purchase securities by mutual written consent of the company
and each of the sponsor or independent director, or, automatically if our initial business combination is not consummated within
24&nbsp;months from the closing of our initial public offering or such later date as may be approved by our shareholders. Our sponsor&rsquo;s
and independent directors&rsquo; obligations to purchase their forward purchase securities are subject to fulfillment of customary
closing conditions, including that our initial business combination must be consummated substantially concurrently with, and immediately
following, the purchase of forward purchase securities and that the company must have delivered a certificate evidencing the company&rsquo;s
good standing as a Cayman Islands exempted limited company, as of a date within ten business days of the closing of the sale of
forward purchase securities. In the event of any such failure to fund, any obligation is so terminated or any such condition is
not satisfied and not waived, we may not be able to obtain additional funds to account for such shortfall on terms favorable to
us or at all. Any such shortfall would also reduce the amount of funds that we have available for working capital of the post-business
combination company. While our sponsor and independent directors represented to us that they have sufficient funds to satisfy their
obligations under the respective forward purchase agreements, we have not obligated them to reserve funds for such obligations.</P>

minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be
able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore,
in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so
that we are not subject to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules). Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted
redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to satisfy
a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may
instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant
to enter into a business combination transaction with us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">At the time we enter
into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights,
and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted
for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to
pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash
in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares
are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion
of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive
equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. In addition, the amount of the deferred underwriting
commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business
combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be
reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our
obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the
most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure.</P>

however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro&nbsp;rata amount per share in the trust account. In either

public offering not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate until October 10, 2020, it could limit
the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, and
we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">As of December 31,
2019, we had approximately $585,000 in cash held outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. We believe
that, the funds available to us outside of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate until October 10, 2020;
however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds
available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the
funds as a down payment or to fund a &ldquo;no-shop&rdquo; provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target
businesses from &ldquo;shopping&rdquo; around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such
target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were
subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds
to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">If we are required
to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or
may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation
to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account
or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible
into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of&thinsp;$1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect
to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing
to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable
to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease
operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public shareholders may only receive an estimated $10.00 per share,
or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless.</P>

initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges
or file for bankruptcy protection, which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations
and our share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Even if we conduct
due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues
with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence,
or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we
may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges or file
for bankruptcy protection, which could result in our reporting losses. For example, following an investment by one of our founders
in Constellation Healthcare Technologies Inc. (&ldquo;CHT&rdquo;), CHT filed for bankruptcy protection. Even if our due diligence
successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent
with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity,
the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition,
charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming
pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any shareholders
who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities.
Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the
reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they
are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as
applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.</P>

in the trust account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have vendors, service
providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us (except our independent
registered public accounting firm) waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust
account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such
agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent
inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the
waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust
account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management
will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the company, and will only enter into an agreement with
such third party if management believes that such third party&rsquo;s engagement would be in the best interests of the company
under the circumstances. The underwriters of our initial public offering will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims
to the monies held in the trust account.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Examples of possible
instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant
whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that
would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.
In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of,
or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any
reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed
timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required
to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10&nbsp;years following
redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.00 per public
share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to a letter agreement, our sponsor agreed
that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or
a prospective target business with which we entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement
or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of&thinsp; (i) $10.00 per
public share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account,
if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability
will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the
monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity
of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether
our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities
of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers
or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target
businesses.</P>

to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent
directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible
that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do
so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount

entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations
of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks
inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant
risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our

We also cannot assure you that an investment in our&nbsp;securities will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than
a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose
to remain shareholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such

to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly,
any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of
their shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully
claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them,
or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials,
as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.</P>

not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting
securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority economic or
voting interest in the post business combination company, depending on the terms of the business combination and valuations ascribed
to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number
of new Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire
a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares,
our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class&nbsp;A ordinary
shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting
in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&rsquo;s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this

These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally

Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to
be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial

including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of
any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information
they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five&nbsp;years, although circumstances could cause us
to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700&nbsp;million
as of any June&nbsp;30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December&nbsp;31.
We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some
investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities
may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices
of our securities may be more volatile.</P>

until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not
have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out
of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates
for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither
an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult
or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.</P>

to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial
reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly
burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business
combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls.
The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the

United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary
responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman
Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands
as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in
the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law
are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular,
the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware,
may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not
have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal court of the United States.</P>

upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities
imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman
Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money
judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a
competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided
certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive
and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment
in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of
which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well
be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are
being brought elsewhere.</P>

Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained
in the future. If in the future such country&rsquo;s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there
may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially

a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net
assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the
currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions.
Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business
or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally,
if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of
a target business as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction.</P>

does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the trust account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds
held in the trust account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to $1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may

rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining

assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:</P>

limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial statements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2019. In making these assessments,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control &mdash; Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.</P>

fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy
solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination.
We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members
of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because
the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation.
Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination,
either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on
our board of directors.</P>

take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial
business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may remain directors or
negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms
of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management&rsquo;s motivation
in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after
the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential
business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon
termination of employment.</P>

an aggregate of 12,375,000 founder shares. On October 10, 2018, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option,
and an aggregate of 500,000 founder shares were subsequently surrendered to us by our sponsor for no consideration on October 19,
2018. Of the 11,875,000 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019, our sponsor owned an aggregate of 11,680,000 Class B ordinary
shares and our independent directors owned an aggregate of 195,000 Class B ordinary shares. The total number of Class&nbsp;B ordinary
shares outstanding equals 20% of the sum of the total number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and Class&nbsp;B ordinary shares outstanding
plus the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares to be sold pursuant to the forward purchase agreements. The Class&nbsp;B ordinary
shares will automatically convert into Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation
of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment.</P>

of our initial public offering. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one ordinary share at $11.50 per

warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30&nbsp;days after the completion
of our initial business combination.</P>

We entered into forward purchase agreements with our sponsor and our independent directors which provide for the purchase of an

ordinary share at $11.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of&thinsp;$35,000,000, or $10.00 per Class&nbsp;A ordinary
share, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. Our sponsor, Antonio
F. Fernandez, Matthew M. Mannelly, William D. Toler and Craig D. Steeneck agreed to purchase, individually or through entities
owned and/or controlled by them, 3,000,000, 100,000, 100,000, 150,000 and 150,000 Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, respectively (or
a price of $30.0 million, $1.0 million, $1.0&nbsp;million, $1.5 million and $1.5 million respectively). Our founders Chinh E. Chu,
Roger K. Deromedi and Jason K. Giordano are the managers of our sponsor and share voting and investment discretion over any securities
owned by our sponsor. Each of our founders, individually or through entities controlled by them, is a member of our sponsor, together

business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned
amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be converted
into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of&thinsp;$1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination,
we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties
will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.</P>

amount of which exceeds (or is reasonably expected to exceed) $120,000 in the aggregate over the duration of the transaction (without
regard to profit or loss); and (iii) in which a &ldquo;related party&rdquo; had, has or will have a direct or indirect material
interest. &ldquo;Related parties&rdquo; under this charter will include: (i)&nbsp;our directors or executive officers; (ii) any

the audit committee will consider (i)&nbsp;the relevant facts and circumstances of each related party transaction, including if
the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arms&rsquo;-length dealings with an unrelated third party,
(ii) the extent of the related party&rsquo;s interest in the transaction, (iii) whether the transaction contravenes our code of
ethics or other policies, (iv) whether the audit committee believes the relationship underlying the transaction to be in the best
interests of the company and its shareholders and (v)&nbsp;the effect that the transaction may have on a director&rsquo;s status
as an independent member of the board and on his or her eligibility to serve on the board&rsquo;s committees. Management will present
to the audit committee each proposed related party transaction, including all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto.
Under the charter, we may consummate related party transactions only if our audit committee approves or ratifies the transaction
in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the charter. The charter will not permit any director or executive officer to participate
in the discussion of, or decision concerning, a related person transaction in which he or she is the related party.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We have audited the accompanying balance
sheets of Collier Creek Holdings (the &quot;Company&quot;) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related statements of operations,
changes in shareholders&rsquo; equity and cash flows, for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for the period from April 30, 2018
(inception) through December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &quot;financial statements&quot;).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for the
period from April 30, 2018 (inception) through December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The accompanying financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, if
the Company is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs as well as complete a Business Combination by the
close of business on October 10, 2020, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. This date
for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company&rsquo;s ability to continue as
a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</P>

of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&quot;PCAOB&quot;)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

(the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on April&nbsp;30, 2018. The Company was
incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar
business combination with one or more businesses that the Company has not yet identified (a &ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo;).
Although the Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination,
the Company intends to focus on the consumer goods industry and related sectors. The Company&rsquo;s sponsor is Collier Creek Partners
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the &ldquo;Sponsor&rdquo;).</P>

The Company has selected December&nbsp;31 as its fiscal year end.</P>

for the Initial Public Offering was declared effective on October 4, 2018. On October 10, 2018, the Company consummated the Initial
Public Offering of 44,000,000&nbsp;units (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo; and, with respect to the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares included
in the Units being offered, the &ldquo;Public Shares&rdquo;), including the issuance of 4,000,000 Units as a result of the underwriters&rsquo;
partial exercise of their over-allotment option, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of&nbsp;$440&nbsp;million (Note

and underwriting commissions (Note 5).</P>

management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public Offering and
Private Placement, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business
Combination. The Company&rsquo;s initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair
market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working
capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in the Trust Account) at the time the Company
signs a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business
Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or
otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act.</P>

its shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination
either (i)&nbsp;in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender
offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer
will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for
a pro&nbsp;rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially approximately $10.00 per share, plus any pro&nbsp;rata
interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations).
The per-share amount to be distributed to public shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred
underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5). These Public Shares subject to potential
redemption were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 480 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo; The Company will proceed with a Business Combination
if (i) the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of such Business Combination and meets
any additional requirements (including but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with such Business Combination
and (ii) a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by
the law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant
to its second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the &ldquo;Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and
Articles of Association&rdquo;), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo;), and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If,
however, a shareholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for
business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy
rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares
irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection
with a Business Combination, the Initial Shareholders (as defined below) agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note
4) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition,
the Initial Shareholders agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection
with the completion of a Business Combination.</P>

the redemption of 100% of the Company&rsquo;s outstanding Public Shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each
holder will receive its pro&nbsp;rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, including any pro&nbsp;rata interest earned
on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay the Company&rsquo;s taxes (less taxes
payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses). The Initial Shareholders agreed to waive their liquidation
rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.
However, if the Initial Shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled
to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business
Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission
(see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the Combination
Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund
the redemption of Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets
remaining available for distribution (including the Trust Account assets) will be only $10.00 per share initially held in the Trust
Account, or less due to reductions in the value of the Trust Account assets. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust
Account, the Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services
rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter
of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust
Account to below the lesser of&thinsp;(i)&nbsp;$10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the
Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per Public Share due to reductions in
the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or
prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not
such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company&rsquo;s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial
Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities
Act&rdquo;). The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims
of creditors by endeavoring to have vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the
Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies
held in the Trust Account.</P>

of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards
until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not
have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt
out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates
for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time
private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements with
another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using
the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.</P>

based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation
allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.</P>

a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company&rsquo;s management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company&rsquo;s
only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income
tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2019
and 2018. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Additionally, commencing
ninety days after the Public Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem its outstanding warrants (except with respect
to the Private Placement Warrants) in whole and not in part, for the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares determined by reference
to the table set forth in the Company&rsquo;s prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering based on the redemption date and
the &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, upon a minimum of 30 days&rsquo; prior written notice
of redemption and if, and only if, the last sale price of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as
adjusted per share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) on the trading day prior to the date
on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the Public Warrant holders. The &ldquo;fair market value&rdquo; of the Class&nbsp;A
ordinary shares is the average last reported sale price of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares for the 10&nbsp;trading days ending
on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">If the Company calls
the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants
to do so on a &ldquo;cashless basis,&rdquo; as described in the warrant agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The exercise price
and number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including
in the event of a share capitalization, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will
not be adjusted for issuance of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will
the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants shares. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within
the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any
of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company&rsquo;s assets held outside
of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.</P>
