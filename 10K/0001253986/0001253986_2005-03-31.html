<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ITEM 1. </B><B><I>BUSINESS</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Overview</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a specialized real estate finance company which invests in a diversified portfolio of
structured finance assets in the multi-family and commercial real estate market. We invest
primarily in real estate-related bridge and mezzanine loans, including junior participating
interests in first mortgages, and preferred equity and, in limited cases, discounted mortgage notes
and other real estate-related assets, which we refer to collectively as structured finance
investments. We also invest in mortgage-related securities. Our principal business objective is
to maximize the difference between the yield on our investments and the cost of financing these
investments to generate cash available for distribution, facilitate capital appreciation and
maximize total return to our stockholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust (&#147;REIT&#148;) for federal income tax
purposes. We commenced operations in July&nbsp;2003 and conduct substantially all of our operations and
investing activities through our operating partnership, Arbor Realty Limited Partnership, and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. We serve as the general partner of our operating partnership, and own
an approximately 81% partnership interest in our operating partnership as of December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are externally managed and advised by Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC (&#147;ACM&#148;), a national
commercial real estate finance company which specializes in debt and equity financing for
multi-family and commercial real estate, pursuant to the terms of a management agreement described
below. We believe ACM&#146;s experience and reputation positions it to originate attractive investment
opportunities for us. Our management agreement with ACM was developed to capitalize on synergies
with ACM&#146;s origination infrastructure, existing business relationships and management expertise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the financing of multi-family and commercial real estate offers significant growth
opportunities that demand customized financing solutions. ACM has granted us a right of first
refusal to pursue all structured finance investment opportunities identified by ACM. ACM continues
to originate and service multi-family and commercial mortgage loans under Fannie Mae, Federal
Housing Administration and conduit commercial lending programs. We believe that the customer
relationships established from these lines of business may generate additional real estate
investment opportunities for our business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Our Corporate History</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003, ACM contributed a portfolio of structured finance investments to our
operating partnership. Concurrently with this contribution, we and our operating partnership
entered into a management agreement with ACM pursuant to which ACM manages our investments for a
base management fee and incentive compensation, and the nine person asset management group of ACM
became our employees.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In exchange for ACM&#146;s contribution of structured finance investments, our operating partnership
issued approximately 3.1&nbsp;million units of limited partnership interest, or operating partnership
units, and approximately 0.6&nbsp;million warrants to purchase additional operating partnership units at
an initial exercise price of $15.00 per operating partnership unit to ACM. Concurrently, we, our
operating partnership and ACM entered into a pairing agreement. Pursuant to the pairing agreement,
each operating partnership unit issued to ACM and issuable to ACM upon exercise of its warrants for
additional operating partnership units in connection with the contribution of initial assets was
paired with one share of the Company&#146;s special voting preferred stock. In October&nbsp;2004, ACM
exercised these warrants and currently holds approximately 3.8&nbsp;million operating partnership units,
constituting an approximately 19% limited partnership interest in our operating partnership. ACM
may redeem each of these operating partnership units for cash or, at our election, one share of our
common stock. We granted ACM certain demand and other registration rights with respect to the
shares of common stock that may be issued upon redemption of these operating

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">partnership units. Each of these operating partnership units is also paired with one share of our
special voting preferred stock entitling ACM to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our
stockholders. ACM currently holds approximately 19% of the voting power of our outstanding stock.
If ACM redeems these operating partnership units, an equivalent number of shares of our special
voting preferred stock will be redeemed and cancelled.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with ACM&#146;s contribution of investments to our operating partnership, we sold 1.6
million of our units, each consisting of five shares of our common stock and one warrant to
purchase an additional share of common stock at an initial exercise price of $15.00 per share, for
$75.00 per unit in a private placement and agreed to register the shares of common stock underlying
these units and warrants for resale under the Securities Act of 1933. On July&nbsp;13, 2004, we
registered approximately 9.6&nbsp;million shares of common stock underlying these units and warrants.
As of March&nbsp;28, 2005, approximately 1.5&nbsp;million warrants were exercised, of which 0.5&nbsp;million
were exercised &#147;cashless&#148;, for a total of 1.2&nbsp;million common shares issued pursuant to their
exercise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2004, we closed our initial public offering in which we issued and sold 6.3&nbsp;million
shares of common stock and a selling stockholder sold 22,500 shares of common stock, each at $20.00
per share. Concurrently with the initial public offering, we sold 0.5&nbsp;million shares of common
stock at the initial public offering price directly to an entity wholly-owned by one of our
directors. The underwriters of our initial public offering exercised their overallotment option
and, in May&nbsp;2004, we issued and sold an additional 0.5&nbsp;million shares of our common stock pursuant
to such exercise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2005, we completed a non-recourse collateralized debt obligation (&#147;CDO&#148;)
transaction, whereby $469&nbsp;million of real estate related and other assets were contributed to a
newly-formed consolidated subsidiary, Arbor Realty SR, Inc., which issued $305&nbsp;million of
investment grade-rated floating-rate notes in a private placement. These proceeds were used to
repay outstanding debt and resulted in a decreased cost of funds relating to the CDO assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Our Investment Strategy</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our principal business objectives are to invest in bridge and mezzanine loans, including
junior participating interests in first mortgages, preferred equity and other real estate related
assets in the multifamily and commercial real estate market and actively manage our investment
portfolio in order to generate cash available for distribution, facilitate capital appreciation and
maximize total return to our stockholders. We believe we can achieve these objectives through the
following business and growth strategies:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Provide Customized Financing. </I></B>We provide financing customized to the needs of our borrowers.
We target borrowers who have demonstrated a history of enhancing the value of the properties they
operate, but whose options may be limited by conventional bank financing and who may benefit from
the sophisticated structured finance products we offer


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Focus on a Niche Market in Smaller Loan Balances. </I></B>We focus on loans with principal amounts
under $40&nbsp;million, which many larger lending firms do not target. We can afford to invest the time
and effort required to close loans of this size because of our relatively efficient cost structure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Execute Transactions Rapidly. </I></B>We act quickly and decisively on proposals, provide commitments
and close transactions within a few weeks and sometimes days, if required. We believe that rapid
execution attracts opportunities from both borrowers and other lenders that would not otherwise be
available. We believe our ability to structure flexible terms and close loans in a timely manner
gives us a competitive advantage over lending firms that also serve the market for loans with
principal amounts under $40&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Manage and Maintain Credit Quality. </I></B>A critical component of our success in the real estate
finance sector is our ability to manage the real estate risk that is underwritten by our manager
and us. We actively manage and maintain the credit quality of our portfolio by using the expertise
of our asset management group, which has a proven track record of structuring and repositioning
structured finance investments to improve the credit quality and yield on managed investments.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Use Arbor Commercial Mortgage&#146;s Relationships with Existing Borrowers. </I></B>We capitalize on ACM&#146;s
reputation in the commercial real estate finance industry. ACM has relationships with over 400
distinct borrowers nationwide. Since ACM&#146;s originators offer senior mortgage loans as well as our
structured finance products, we are able to benefit from its existing customer base and use its
senior lending business as a potential refinance vehicle for our structured finance assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Offer Broader Products and Expand Customer Base. </I></B>We have the ability to offer a larger number
of financing alternatives than ACM has been able to offer to its customers in the past. Our
potential borrowers are able to choose from products offering longer maturities and larger
principal amounts than ACM could previously offer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Leverage the Experience of Executive Officers and Arbor Commercial Mortgage and Our Employees.</I></B>
Our executive officers and employees, and those of ACM, have extensive experience originating and
managing structured commercial real estate investments. Our senior management team has on average
over 20&nbsp;years experience in the financial services industry including prior experience in managing
and operating a public company, the predecessor of ACM.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Our Targeted Investments</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We actively pursue lending and investment opportunities with property owners and developers
who need interim financing until permanent financing can be obtained. We target transactions under
$40&nbsp;million where we believe we have competitive advantages, particularly our lower cost structure
and in house capabilities. Our structured finance investments generally have maturities of two to
five years, depending on type, have extension options when appropriate, and generally require a
balloon payment of principal at maturity. Borrowers in the market for these types of loans
include, but are not limited to, owners or developers seeking either to acquire or refurbish real
estate or to pay down debt and reposition a property for permanent financing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investment program emphasizes the following general categories of real estate related
activities:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Bridge Financing. </I></B>We offer bridge financing products to borrowers who are typically seeking
short term capital to be used in an acquisition of property. The borrower has usually identified
an undervalued asset that has been under managed and/or is located in a recovering market. From
the borrower&#146;s perspective, shorter term bridge financing is advantageous because it allows time to
improve the property value through repositioning the property without encumbering it with
restrictive long term debt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridge loans we make typically range in size from $3&nbsp;million to $30&nbsp;million and are
predominantly secured by first mortgage liens on the property. The term of the loan typically is
up to five years. Historically, interest rates have ranged from 3.00% to 9.00% over 30-day LIBOR.
Additional yield enhancements may include origination fees, deferred interest and participating
interests, which are equity interests in the borrower that share in a percentage of the underlying
cash flows of the property. Borrowers usually use the proceeds of a conventional mortgage to repay
a bridge loan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Mezzanine Financing. </I></B>We offer mezzanine financing in the form of loans that are subordinate to
a conventional first mortgage loan and senior to the borrower&#146;s equity in a transaction. These
loans may be in the form of a junior participating interest in the senior debt. Mezzanine financing
may take the form of loans secured by pledges of ownership interests in entities that directly or
indirectly control the real property or subordinated loans secured by second mortgage liens on the
property. We may also require additional collateral such as personal guarantees, letters of credit
and/or additional collateral unrelated to the property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mezzanine loans typically range in size from $3&nbsp;million to $35&nbsp;million and have terms of
up to seven years. Historically, interest rates have ranged from 5.00% to 12.00% over 30-day LIBOR,

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">occasionally with an interest rate floor. As in the case with our bridge loans, the yield on
these investments may be enhanced by prepaid and deferred interest payments, yield look-backs and
participating interests.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hold our mezzanine loans through subsidiaries of our operating partnership that are
pass-through entities for tax purposes or taxable subsidiary corporations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Preferred Equity Investments. </I></B>We provide financing by making preferred equity investments in
entities that directly or indirectly own real property. In cases where the terms of a first
mortgage prohibit additional liens on the ownership entity, investments structured as preferred
equity in the entity owning the property serve as viable financing substitutes. With preferred
equity investments, we typically become a special limited partner or member in the ownership
entity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Real Property Acquisitions. </I></B>We may purchase existing real estate for repositioning and/or
renovation and then disposition at an anticipated significant return. From time to time, we may
identify real estate investment opportunities. In these situations, we may act solely on our own
behalf or in partnership with other investors. Typically, these transactions are analyzed with the
expectation that we will have the ability to sell the property within a one to two year time
period, achieving a significant return on invested capital. In connection with these transactions,
speed of execution is often the most critical component to success. We may seek to finance a
portion of the acquisition price through short term financing. Repayment of the short term
financing will either come from the sale of the property or conventional permanent debt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Note Acquisitions. </I></B>We may acquire real estate notes from lenders in situations where the
borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes, for a
variety of reasons (such as risk mitigation, portfolio diversification or other strategic reasons),
to divest certain assets from its portfolio. These notes may be acquired at a discount. In such
cases, we intend to use our management resources to resolve any dispute concerning the note or the
property securing it and to identify and resolve any existing operational or any other problems at
the property. We will then either restructure the debt obligation for immediate resale or sale at a
later date or reposition it for permanent financing. In some instances, we may take title to the
property underlying the real estate note.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Mortgage-Related Securities. </I></B>We invest in certificates issued by the Government National
Mortgage Association, or GNMA, Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, or the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Association, or FHLMC that are collateralized by whole pools of fixed or adjustable
rate residential or commercial mortgage loans. We refer to these mortgage-related securities as
agency-sponsored whole loan pool certificates. The adjustable rate mortgage-related securities
include adjustable-rate FHLMC ARM and FNMA ARM certificates, which are generally evidenced by pools
of mortgage loans with a fixed rate of interest for the first three years with annual interest
adjustments thereafter and GNMA ARM certificates, which have a fixed rate of interest for the first
three years with annual adjustments in relation to the Treasury index thereafter. Unlike
conventional fixed-income securities which provide for periodic fixed interest payments and
principal payments at maturity and specified call dates, mortgage-related securities provide for
monthly payments of interest and principal that, in effect, are a &#147;pass-through&#148; of the monthly
payments made by the borrowers on the residential or commercial mortgage loans underlying such
securities, net of any fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of such securities. Additional
payments on the securities are made when repayments of principal are made due to the sale of the
underlying property, refinancing or foreclosure, net of fees or costs that may be incurred. Some
mortgage-related securities (such as securities issued by GNMA) are described as &#147;modified
pass-through&#148; because they entitle the holder to receive all interest and principal payments owed
on the mortgage pool, net of certain fees, at scheduled payment dates regardless of whether or not
the mortgagor makes the payment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans affect the price and volatility of
mortgage-related securities and may have the effect of shortening or extending the effective
maturity of the security beyond what was anticipated at the time of our investment in such
securities. The yield and maturity characteristics of mortgage-related securities differ from
conventional fixed-income securities in that the principal amount of mortgage-related securities
may be prepaid at any time because the underlying

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">mortgage loans may be prepaid at any time. Therefore, some mortgage-related securities may
have less potential for growth in value than conventional fixed-income securities with comparable
maturities. In addition, the rate of prepayments tends to increase in periods of falling interest
rates. During such periods, the reinvestment of prepayment proceeds by us will generally be at
lower rates than the rates that were carried by the obligations that have been prepaid. To the
extent that we purchase mortgage-related securities at a premium, prepayments (which may be made
without penalty) may result in loss of our principal investment to the extent of the premium paid.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Our Structured Finance Investments</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We own a diversified portfolio of structured finance investments consisting primarily of real
estate-related bridge and mezzanine loans as well as preferred equity investments and
mortgage-backed securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2004, we had 61 loans and investments in our portfolio, totaling $842&nbsp;million.
These loans and investments were for 31 multi-family properties, 9 condo properties, 13 office
properties, 3 hotels, 2 commercial properties, 2 retail properties, and 1 co-op property. There are
no loans or investments in the portfolio that are non-performing. We continue to actively manage
all loans and investments in the portfolio and believe that our strict underwriting and active
asset management enable us to maintain the credit quality of our portfolio.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall yield on our portfolio in 2004 was 8.80% on average assets of $635.1&nbsp;million. This
yield was computed by dividing the interest income earned during the year by the average assets
during the year. Our cost of funds in 2004 was 4.80% on average borrowings of $383.8&nbsp;million. This
cost of funds was computed by dividing the interest expense incurred during the year by the average
borrowings during the year. Our average net investment (average assets less average borrowings) in
2004 was $251.3&nbsp;million, resulting in average leverage (average borrowings divided by average
assets) of 60.4%. The net interest income earned in 2004 yielded a 15.2% return on our average net
investment during the year. This yield was computed by dividing the net interest (interest income
less interest expense) earned in 2004 by the average equity (computed as average assets minus
average borrowings) invested during the year. Our business plan contemplates that our leverage
ratio will be approximately 65% to 70%. However, our leverage will not exceed 80% of the value of
our assets in the aggregate unless approval to exceed the 80% limit is obtained from our board of
directors.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, we invested $57.4&nbsp;million (including $0.1&nbsp;million of purchased interest) in
agency-sponsored whole pool certificates. $20.6&nbsp;million of these securities were issued by FNMA
and $36.7&nbsp;million were issued by FHLMC. Pools of FNMA and FHLMC adjustable rate residential
mortgage loans underlie these securities. The underlying mortgage loans bear interest at a
weighted average fixed rate for three years and adjusts annually thereafter and have a weighted
average coupon rate of 3.8%. We receive monthly payments of interest and principal on these
securities based on the monthly interest and principal payments that are made on the underlying
mortgage loans. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, these securities were financed under a $100&nbsp;million
repurchase agreement, maturing July&nbsp;2005, at a rate of one-month LIBOR plus 0.15%. At December&nbsp;31,
2004, the amortized cost of these securities was $47.1&nbsp;million and the amount outstanding on the
repurchase agreement related to the financing of these securities was $44.2&nbsp;million. These
investments had a weighted average balance of $51.9&nbsp;million for the year with an average yield of
2.08%. These assets were financed by borrowings with a weighted average balance of $50.3&nbsp;million
and an average cost of of funds of 1.24%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table below sets forth information regarding our investments in mortgage-related
securities as of December&nbsp;31, 2004. These securities have a fixed interest rate until March&nbsp;2007,
and adjust annually thereafter.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Regulatory Aspects of Our Investment Strategy</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Real Estate Exemption from Investment Company Act. </B>We believe that we conduct and we intend
to conduct our business at all times in a manner that avoids registration as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940. There is an exemption from registration for entities that
are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring &#147;mortgages and other
liens on and interests in real estate.&#148; This exemption generally requires us to maintain at least
55% of our assets directly in qualifying real estate assets. Assets that qualify for purposes of
this 55% test include, among other things, real estate, mortgage loans and agency-sponsored whole
loan pool certificates. Our bridge loans secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying
properties&#146; loans secured by second mortgage liens on the underlying properties and
agency-sponsored whole loan pool certificates generally qualify for purposes of this 55% test. We
believe that these assets and certain of our mezzanine loans are in excess of 55% of our assets as
of December&nbsp;31, 2004 to qualify for purposes of the 55% test. The percentage of our assets that we
invest in agency-sponsored whole loan pool certificates may decrease if we determine that we do not
need to purchase such certificates for purposes of meeting the 55% test. If the Securities and
Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) takes a position or makes an interpretation more favorable to us, we
may have greater flexibility in the investments we make. Our investments in mortgage-related
securities are limited to agency-sponsored whole loan pool certificates which qualify for purposes
of the 55% test. Our investment guidelines provide that no more than 15% of our assets may consist
of any type of the mortgage-related securities and that the percentage of our investments in
mortgage-related securities as compared to our structured finance investments be monitored on a
regular basis.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Management Agreement</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003, we and our operating partnership entered into a management agreement with
ACM. On January&nbsp;19, 2005, we, our operating partnership, Arbor Realty SR, Inc., one of our
subsidiaries and ACM entered into an amended and restated management agreement with substantially
the same terms as the original management agreement in order to add Arbor Realty SR, Inc. as a
beneficiary of ACM&#146;s services. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, our manager has
agreed to service and manage our investments and to provide us with structured finance investment
opportunities, finance and other services necessary to operate our business. Our manager is
required to provide a dedicated management team to provide these services to us, the members of
which will devote such of their time to our management as our independent directors reasonably deem
necessary and appropriate, commensurate with our level of activity from time to time. We rely to a
significant extent on the facilities and resources of our manager to conduct our operations. For
performing services under the management agreement, ACM receives a base management fee and
incentive compensation calculated as described in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Arbor Realty Trust Inc. and Subsidiaries&#148; under
Item&nbsp;7 of this report.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Operations</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Our Manager&#146;s Investment Services. </B>Under the management agreement, ACM is responsible for
sourcing originations, providing underwriting services and processing approvals for all loans and
other investments in our portfolio. ACM also provides certain administrative loan servicing
functions with respect to our loans and investments. We are able to capitalize on ACM&#146;s well
established operations and services in each area described below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Origination. </I></B>Our manager sources the origination of most of our investments. ACM has a
network of 15 sales offices located in Atlanta, Georgia; Bethesda, Maryland; Bloomfield Hills,
Michigan; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Woodland Hills, California;
Rochester, New York; New York, New York; San Francisco, California; Pasadena, California; Manhattan
Beach California; Salt Lake City, Utah; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Uniondale, New York. These
offices are staffed by approximately 21 loan originators who solicit property owners, developers
and mortgage loan brokers. In some instances, the originators accept loan applications meeting our
underwriting criteria from a select group of mortgage loan brokers. While a large portion of ACM&#146;s
marketing effort occurs at the branch level, ACM also markets its products in industry publications
and targeted direct mailings. ACM markets structured finance products and our product offerings
using the same methods. Once potential borrowers have been identified, ACM determines which
financing products best meet the borrower&#146;s needs. Loan originators in every branch office are able
to offer borrowers the full array of ACM&#146;s and our structured finance products. After identifying a
suitable product, ACM works with the borrower to prepare a loan application. Upon completion by the
borrower, the application is forwarded to ACM&#146;s underwriters for due diligence.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Underwriting. </I></B>ACM&#146;s loan originators work in conjunction with its underwriters who perform
due diligence on all proposed transactions prior to loan approval and commitment. The underwriters
analyze each loan application in accordance with the guidelines set forth below in order to
determine the loan&#146;s conformity with respect to such guidelines. In general, ACM&#146;s underwriting
guidelines require it to evaluate the following: the historic and in place property revenues and
expenses; the potential for near term revenue growth and opportunity for expense reduction and
increased operating efficiencies; the property&#146;s location, its attributes and competitive position
within its market; the proposed ownership structure, financial strength and real estate experience

liability insurance. Key factors considered in credit decisions include, but are not limited to,
debt service coverage, loan to value ratios and property, financial and operating performance.
Consideration is also given to other factors, such as additional forms of collateral and
identifying likely strategies to effect repayment. ACM will refine its underwriting criteria based
upon actual loan portfolio experience and as market conditions and investor requirements evolve.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Investment Approval Process. </I></B>ACM applies its established investment approval process to all
loans and other investments proposed for our portfolio before submitting each proposal to us for
final approval. A written report is generated for every loan or other investment that is submitted
to ACM&#146;s credit committee for approval. The report includes a description of the prospective
borrower and any guarantors, the collateral and the proposed use of investment proceeds, as well as
borrower and property consolidated financial statements and analysis. In addition, the report
summarizes an analysis of borrower liquidity, net worth, cash investment, income, credit history
and operating experience. If the transaction is approved by a majority of ACM&#146;s credit committee,
it is presented for approval to our credit committee, which consists of our chief executive
officer, chief credit officer, and executive vice president of structured finance. All transactions
require the approval of a majority of the members of our credit committee. Following the approval
of any such transaction, ACM&#146;s underwriting and servicing departments, together with our asset
management group, assure that all loan approval terms have been satisfied and that they conform
with lending requirements established for that particular transaction. If our credit committee and
our independent directors reject the loan and our independent directors allow ACM or one of its
affiliates to pursue it, ACM will have the opportunity to execute the transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Servicing. </I></B>ACM services our loans and investments through its internal servicing operations.
Our manager currently services an expanding portfolio, consisting of approximately 600 loans with
outstanding balances of $3.5&nbsp;billion through its loan administration department in Buffalo, New
York. ACM&#146;s loan servicing operations are designed to provide prompt customer service and accurate
and timely information for account follow up, financial reporting and management review. Following
the funding of an approved loan, all pertinent loan data is entered into ACM&#146;s data processing
system, which provides monthly billing statements, tracks payment performance and processes
contractual interest rate adjustments on variable rate loans. Our manager utilizes the operations
of its loan administration department to service our portfolio with the same efficiency, accuracy
and promptness. ACM also works closely with our asset management group to ensure the appropriate
level of customer service and monitoring of these loans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Our
Asset Management Operations.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our asset management group is comprised of fifteen
employees. Prior to our formation, the asset management group successfully managed numerous
transactions, including complex restructurings, refinancings and asset dispositions for ACM.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective asset and portfolio management is essential to maximizing the performance and value
of a real estate investment. The asset management group customizes an asset management plan with
the loan originators and underwriters to track each investment from origination through
disposition. This group monitors each investment&#146;s operating history, local economic trends and
rental and occupancy rates and evaluates the underlying property&#146;s competitiveness within its
market. This group assesses potential operational and financial performance of each investment in
order to evaluate and ultimately improve its operations and financial viability. The asset
management group performs frequent onsite inspections, conducts meetings with borrowers and
evaluates and participates in the budgeting process, financial and operational review and
renovation plans of each of the underlying properties. As an asset and portfolio manager, the
asset management group focuses on increasing the productivity of on site property managers and
leasing brokers. This group communicates the status of each transaction against its established
asset management plan to senior management in order to enhance and preserve capital, as well as to
avoid litigation and potential exposure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timely and accurate identification of an investment&#146;s operational and financial issues and
each borrower&#146;s objectives is essential to implementing an executable loan workout and
restructuring process. Since existing management may not have the requisite expertise to manage the
workout process effectively, the asset management group determines current operating and financial
status of an asset or portfolio and

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">performs liquidity analysis of properties and ownership entities and then, if appropriate,
identifies and evaluates alternatives in order to maximize the value of an investment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our asset management group continues to provide its services to ACM on a limited basis
pursuant to an asset management services agreement between ACM and us. The asset management
services agreement will be effective throughout the term of our management agreement and during the
origination period described in the management agreement. In the event the services provided by our
asset management group pursuant to this agreement exceed by more than 15% per quarter the level
anticipated by our board of directors, we will negotiate in good faith with our manager an
adjustment to our manager&#146;s base management fee under the management agreement, to reduce the scope
of the services, the quantity of serviced assets or the time required to be devoted to the services
by our asset management group.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Operating Policies and Strategies</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Investment
Guidelines.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Our board of directors has adopted general guidelines for our
investments and borrowings to the effect that: (1)&nbsp;no investment will be made that would cause us
to fail to qualify as a REIT; (2)&nbsp;no investment will be made that would cause us to be regulated as
an investment company under the Investment Company Act; (3)&nbsp;no more than 25% of our equity,
determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in any single asset; (4)&nbsp;our
leverage will generally not exceed 80% of the value of our assets, in the aggregate; (5)&nbsp;we will
not co-invest with our manager or any of its affiliates unless such co-investment is otherwise in
accordance with these guidelines and its terms are at least as favorable to us as to our manager or
the affiliate making such co-investment; (6)&nbsp;no more than 15% of our gross assets may consist of
mortgage-related securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Financing
Policies.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;We finance the acquisition of our structured finance investments
primarily by borrowing against or &#147;leveraging&#148; our existing portfolio and using the proceeds to
acquire additional mortgage assets. We expect to incur debt such that we will maintain an equity to
assets ratio no greater than 20%, although the actual ratio may be lower from time to time
depending on market conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our manager. Our charter and
bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness we can incur, and the board of directors has
discretion to deviate from or change our indebtedness policy at any time. However, we intend to
maintain an adequate capital base to protect against various business environments in which our
financing and hedging costs might exceed the net interest income from our investments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our investments are financed primarily by floating rate secured notes collateralized by
certain of our structured finance investments and through our floating rate warehouse lines of
credit, loan repurchase agreements and other financing facilities with institutional lenders.
Although we expect that these will be the principal means of leveraging our investments, we may
issue preferred stock or secured or unsecured notes of any maturity if it appears advantageous to
do so.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Credit
Risk Management Policy.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed to various levels of credit and special hazard
risk depending on the nature of our underlying assets and the nature and level of credit
enhancements supporting our assets. We originate or purchase mortgage loans that meet our minimum
debt service coverage standards. ACM, as our manager, our asset management group and our chief
credit officer review and monitor credit risk and other risks of loss associated with each
investment. In addition, ACM seeks to diversify our portfolio of assets to avoid undue geographic,
issuer, industry and certain other types of concentrations. Our board of directors monitors the
overall portfolio risk and reviews levels of provision for loss.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Interest
Rate Risk Management Policy.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent consistent with our election to qualify as
a REIT, we follow an interest rate risk management policy intended to mitigate the negative effects
of major interest rate changes. We minimize our interest rate risk from borrowings by attempting to
structure the key terms of our borrowings to generally correspond to the interest rate term of our
assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may enter into hedging transactions to protect our investment portfolio from interest rate
fluctuations and other changes in market conditions. These transactions may include interest rate
swaps, the


<P align="center" style="font-size: 7.5pt">10

<!-- PAGEBREAK -->

<H5 align="left" style="page-break-before:always"><A HREF="#tocpage">Table of Contents</A></H5><P>

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">purchase or sale of interest rate collars, caps or floors, options, mortgage derivatives and
other hedging instruments. These instruments may be used to hedge as much of the interest rate risk
as ACM determines is in the best interest of our stockholders, given the cost of such hedges and
the need to maintain our status as a REIT. In general, income from hedging transactions does not
constitute qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income requirements. To the extent,
however, that we enter into a hedging contract to reduce interest rate risk on indebtedness
incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets, any income that we
derive from the contract, while comprising nonqualifying income for purposes of the REIT 75% gross income test,
would not give rise to nonqualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross
income test. ACM may elect to have us bear a level of interest rate risk that could otherwise be
hedged when it believes, based on all relevant facts, that bearing such risk is advisable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, the only hedging transaction we have entered into was an interest rate swap in
December&nbsp;2004 in connection with the issuance of floating rate secured notes collateralized by
certain of our structured finance investments. The notional amount of the interest rate swap
agreement approximates the amount of the floating rate secured notes. We will receive interest
payments on the notional amount based on three-month LIBOR and pay interest on the notional amount
based on one-month LIBOR.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Disposition
Policies.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are no current plans to dispose of properties or other
assets within our portfolio, ACM evaluates our asset portfolio on a regular basis to determine if
it continues to satisfy our investment criteria. Subject to certain restrictions applicable to
REITs, ACM may cause us to sell our investments opportunistically and use the proceeds of any such
sale for debt reduction, additional acquisitions or working capital purposes.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Equity
Capital Policies.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to applicable law, our board of directors has the authority,
without further stockholder approval, to issue additional authorized common stock and preferred
stock or otherwise raise capital, including through the issuance of senior securities, in any
manner and on the terms and for the consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for
property. We may in the future issue common stock in connection with acquisitions. We also may
issue units of partnership interest in our operating partnership in connection with acquisitions
of property. We may, under certain circumstances, repurchase our common stock in private
transactions with our stockholders, if those purchases are approved by our board of directors. Our
board of directors has no present intention of causing us to repurchase any shares, and any action
would only be taken in conformity with applicable federal and state laws and the applicable
requirements for qualifying as a REIT, for so long as the board of directors concludes that we
should continue to qualify as a REIT.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Conflicts
of Interest Policies.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;We, our executive officers and ACM face conflicts of interests
because of our relationships with each other. Mr.&nbsp;Kaufman is our chief executive officer and the
chief executive officer of ACM and serves on our credit committee. Mr.&nbsp;Ivan Kaufman and entities
controlled by him own approximately 90% of the outstanding membership interests of ACM. Mr.&nbsp;Herbst
is our chief financial officer and the chief financial officer of ACM and has a minority ownership
interest in ACM. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Weber, our executive vice president of structured finance and two
of our directors, Mr.&nbsp;Joseph Martello and Mr.&nbsp;Walter Horn, have minority ownership interests in
ACM. Mr.&nbsp;Horn also serves as our secretary and general counsel. Mr.&nbsp;Martello serves as the trustee
and co-trustee of two separate trusts through which Mr.&nbsp;Kaufman owns an equity interest in ACM.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have implemented several policies, through board action and through the terms of our
constituent documents and of our agreements with ACM, to help address these conflicts of interest:

directors (including a majority of our independent directors) determines that such modification or
waiver is in the best interest of our stockholders. Among other factors, developments in the
market that either affect the policies and strategies mentioned herein or that change our
assessment of the market may cause our board of directors to revise its policies and strategies.
However, if such modification or waiver involves the relationship of, or any transaction between,
us and our manager or any affiliate of our manager, the approval of a majority of our independent
directors is also required. We may not, however, amend our charter to change the requirement that a

entitled to be cast by our stockholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Laws</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Properties that we may acquire, and the properties underlying our structured finance
investments and mortgage-related securities, are subject to various federal, state and local
environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. Under these laws, ordinances and regulations, a
current or previous owner of real estate (including, in certain circumstances, a secured lender
that succeeds to ownership or control of a property) may become liable for the costs of removal or
remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at, on, under or
in its property. These laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard
to whether the owner or control party knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of the
hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of these
substances may be substantial and could exceed the value of the property. An owner or control
party of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs
resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. Certain environmental laws also
impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to materials containing asbestos.
These laws allow third parties to seek recovery from owners of real properties for personal
injuries associated with materials containing asbestos. Our operating costs and the values of
these assets may be adversely affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with
existing environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as the cost of complying with
future legislation, and our income and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be
affected adversely by the existence of an environmental liability with respect to properties we may
acquire. We will endeavor to ensure that these properties are in compliance in all material
respects with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or
toxic substances or petroleum products.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our net income depends, in large part, on our manager&#146;s ability to originate structured
finance investments with spreads over our borrowing costs. In originating these investments, our
manager competes with other mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan
associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors,
investment banking firms, other lenders, governmental bodies and other entities, some of which may
have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital available to them. In addition, there
are numerous mortgage REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours, and others may be
organized in the future. The effect of the existence of additional REITs may be to increase
competition for the available supply of structured finance assets suitable for purchase by us.
Competitive variables include market presence and visibility, size of loans offered and
underwriting standards. To the extent that a competitor is willing to risk larger amounts of
capital in a particular transaction or to employ more liberal underwriting standards when
evaluating potential loans, our origination volume and profit margins for our investment portfolio
could be impacted. Our competitors may also be willing to accept lower returns on their investments
and may succeed in buying the assets that we have targeted for acquisition. Although management
believes that we are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in each facet of our
business, there can be no assurance that we will do so or that we will not encounter further
increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to compete effectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Employees</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently have twenty-one employees, including Mr.&nbsp;Kovarik, our chief credit officer, Mr.
Weber, our executive vice president of structured finance, and Mr.&nbsp;Kilgore, our executive vice

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(1)&nbsp;We were formed in June&nbsp;2003 as a Maryland corporation and became a publicly traded company
after the pricing of our public offering on April&nbsp;6, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(2)&nbsp;Represents the portion of the second quarter of 2004 prior to our initial public offering.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(3)&nbsp;When combined with the $0.02 paid for the period April 1 through April&nbsp;6, represents a regular
quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(4)&nbsp;On January&nbsp;13, 2005, we declared distributions of $0.47 per share of common stock, payable
with respect to the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of
business on January&nbsp;31, 2005.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate
investment trust, or a REIT, which requires that we distribute at least 90% of taxable income. Therefore, we intend to
continue to declare quarterly distributions on our common stock. No assurance, however, can be
given as to the amounts or timing of future distributions as such distributions are subject to our
earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our board of
directors deems relevant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
March&nbsp;18, 2005, the closing sale price for our common stock, as reported on the NYSE, was
$25.68. As of March 18, 2005, there were 3,336 record holders of our common stock. This figure does
not reflect the beneficial ownership of shares held in nominee name.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the quarter ending December&nbsp;31, 2004, we issued a total of 422,204 shares of common
stock upon the exercise of 430,016 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and received a
total of approximately $6.3&nbsp;million in proceeds as a result of the exercise of such warrants. These
warrants were originally issued and sold as part of units, each consisting of five shares of common
stock and one warrant. Pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement, dated as of July&nbsp;1, 2003,
each of the warrants are exercisable from July&nbsp;13, 2004 to July&nbsp;1, 2005 for one share of common
stock at an initial exercise price of $15 in cash or a number of shares of common stock or warrants
deemed to have a fair market value equivalent to the cash exercise price. Of the total number of
shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of such warrants, 418,748 shares were issued in
consideration of the payment of the cash exercise price and 3,456 shares were issued in
consideration of the holder of the related warrant surrendering shares of common stock or
additional warrants in lieu of the cash exercise price. Funds received from the exercise of
warrants were initially used to pay down debt outstanding under our credit facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issuance and sale of the shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of these warrants
was not registered under the Securities Act in reliance on the exemption from registration provided
by Section&nbsp;4(2) thereof. These transactions did not involve any public offering of common stock,
the holders of the warrants had adequate access to information about us through our public filings
with the SEC, and an appropriate legend was placed on the certificates evidencing the shares of
common stock issued to the exercising holders of the warrants.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;3, 2004, we issued 22,498 shares of common stock to ACM as payment of the
incentive compensation earned by ACM for the quarter ending September&nbsp;30, 2004. The issuance of
these 22,498 shares as payment for ACM&#146;s incentive compensation was not registered under the
Securities Act in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section&nbsp;4(2) thereof.

STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS OF ARBOR COMMERCIAL<BR>
MORTGAGE, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003, Arbor Commercial Mortgage contributed a portfolio of structured finance
investments and related liabilities to our operating partnership. In addition, certain employees of
Arbor Commercial Mortgage became our employees. These assets, liabilities and employees represented
a substantial portion of Arbor Commercial Mortgage&#146;s structured finance business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tables on the following page present selected historical consolidated financial
information of the structured finance business of Arbor Commercial Mortgage at the dates and for
the periods indicated. The structured finance business did not operate as a separate legal entity
or business division or segment of Arbor Commercial Mortgage but as an integrated part of Arbor
Commercial Mortgage&#146;s consolidated business. Accordingly, the statements of revenue and direct
operating expenses do not include charges from Arbor Commercial Mortgage for corporate general and
administrative expense because Arbor Commercial Mortgage considered such items to be corporate
expenses and did not allocate them to individual business units. These expenses included costs for
Arbor Commercial Mortgage&#146;s executive management, corporate facilities and overhead costs,
corporate accounting and treasury functions, corporate legal matters and other similar costs. The
selected consolidated financial information presented under the caption &#145;&#145;Consolidated Statement of
Revenue and Direct Operating Expenses Data&#146;&#146; for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001, the
six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003 and under the caption &#145;&#145;Consolidated Statement of Assets and
Liabilities Data&#146;&#146; as of December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001 have been derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements of the structured finance business of Arbor Commercial Mortgage included
elsewhere in this report. The selected consolidated financial information presented under the
caption &#145;&#145;Consolidated Statement of Revenue and Direct Operating Expenses Data&#146;&#146; for the six months
ended June&nbsp;30, 2003 is not necessarily indicative of the results of any other interim period or the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. The selected consolidated financial information presented under the
caption &#145;&#145;Consolidated Statement of Revenue and Direct Operating Expenses Data&#146;&#146; for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2000 and the caption &#145;&#145;Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities Data&#146;&#146; as of
December&nbsp;31, 2000 have also been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the
structured finance business of Arbor Commercial Mortgage. The selected consolidated financial
information presented under the caption &#145;&#145;Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities Data&#146;&#146;
as of December&nbsp;31, 2000 has been derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of
the structured finance business of Arbor Commercial Mortgage.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The selected consolidated financial information presented under the caption &#145;&#145;Consolidated
Statement of Revenue and Direct Operating Expenses Data&#146;&#146; for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2002
have been derived from the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Arbor Commercial
Mortgage&#146;s structured finance business and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring accruals, which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the historical
consolidated financial information for such periods. The selected consolidated financial
information presented under the caption &#145;&#145;Consolidated Statement of Revenue and Direct Operating
Expenses Data&#146;&#146; for the six-month period ended June&nbsp;30, 2002 are not necessarily indicative of the
results of any other interim period or the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The consolidated financial statements of Arbor Commercial Mortgage&#146;s structured finance business
included in this report represent the consolidated financial position and results of operations of
Arbor Commercial Mortgage&#146;s structured finance business during certain periods and at certain dates
when Arbor Commercial Mortgage previously held our initial assets, as well as several other
structured finance investments that we did not acquire in connection with our formation
transactions. See &#145;&#145;Arbor Realty Trust, Inc.&#146;&#146; Accordingly, the historical financial results of
Arbor Commercial Mortgage&#146;s structured finance business are not indicative of our future
performance. In addition, since the information presented is only a summary and does not provide
all of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements of Arbor Commercial
Mortgage&#146;s structured finance business, including related notes, you should read it in conjunction

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 8pt"><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">(1)</SUP> In June&nbsp;1998, Arbor Commercial Mortgage
entered into a joint venture with SFG I, an affiliate of Nomura Asset Capital
Corp., for the purpose of acquiring up to $250&nbsp;million of structured finance
investments. Arbor Commercial Mortgage and SFG I each made 50% of the capital
contributions to the joint venture and shared profits equally. Nomura Asset
Capital Corp. provided financing to the joint venture in the form of a
repurchase agreement. On July&nbsp;31, 2001, Arbor Commercial Mortgage purchased SFG

purchase accounting method. Prior to the purchase, net income from this venture

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Overview</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a Maryland corporation that was formed in June&nbsp;2003 to invest in real estate-related
bridge and mezzanine loans, including junior participating interests in first mortgages, preferred
equity and, in limited cases, discounted mortgage notes and other real estate-related assets, which
we refer to collectively as structured finance investments. We also invest in mortgage-related
securities. We conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors:

borrowings decreases, this will have a positive impact on earnings. Net interest income is
also directly impacted by the size of our asset portfolio.</TD>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or a
REIT and to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the
Code with respect thereto. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of
its REIT-taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders provided that at least 90% of its
REIT-taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. Certain of
our assets that produce non-qualifying income may be held in taxable REIT subsidiaries. Unlike
other subsidiaries of a REIT, the income of a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to Federal and
state income taxes. As our taxable REIT subsidiaries have had minimal activity since their
inception, we have determined that no provision for income taxes is necessary at this time.

structured finance assets, encumbered by $169.2&nbsp;million of borrowings in exchange for an equity
interest in our operating partnership represented by 3,146,724 units of limited partnership
interest and 629,345 warrants to acquire additional units of limited partnership interest. In
addition, certain employees of ACM became our employees. We are externally managed and advised by
ACM and pay ACM a management fee in accordance with a management agreement. ACM originates,
underwrites and services all structured finance assets on behalf of our operating partnership.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with ACM&#146;s asset contribution, we consummated a private placement of 1.6&nbsp;million
units, each consisting of five shares of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of
common stock, for $75.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of $120.2&nbsp;million. Gross proceeds
from the private placement combined with the concurrent equity contribution by ACM totaled
approximately $164.1&nbsp;million in equity capital.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;13, 2004, we sold 6,750,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of
$20.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $124.4&nbsp;million after deducting the underwriting
discount and the other estimated offering expenses. On May&nbsp;11, 2004, we issued and sold 524,200
additional shares of common stock, for net proceeds of approximately $9.8&nbsp;million after deducting
the underwriting discount pursuant to the exercise of a portion of the over-allotment option
granted to the underwriters of our initial public offering. Additionally, as of December&nbsp;31, 2004,
we issued 973,354 shares of common stock from the exercise of warrants originally issued as a
component of units on July&nbsp;1, 2003, for proceeds of $12.9&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Changes in Financial Condition</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year, we originated fifty-three loans and investments totaling $782.3&nbsp;million, of
which $746.1&nbsp;million was funded as of December&nbsp;31, 2004. Of the new loans and investments,
twenty-three were mezzanine loans totaling $387.5&nbsp;million, twenty were bridge loans totaling $300.8
million, five were junior participating interests totaling $84.5&nbsp;million, and five were direct
equity investments totaling $9.6&nbsp;million. We have received full satisfaction of nineteen loans
totaling $181.4&nbsp;million and partial repayment on seven loans totaling $40.0&nbsp;million. Also, we had
sold one equity investment totaling $3.0&nbsp;million, two equity investments convert to loans totaling
$6.7&nbsp;million and we recorded a $0.5&nbsp;million distribution for one of our equity investments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since December&nbsp;31, 2004, we have originated seven loans totaling approximately $134.7&nbsp;million.
In addition, we have received $145.9&nbsp;million for the repayment in full of ten loans and $36.0
million for the partial repayment of two loans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our loan portfolio balance at December&nbsp;31, 2004 was $842.5&nbsp;million, with a weighted average
current interest pay rate of 8.87%, as compared to $323.5&nbsp;million, with a weighted average interest
pay rate of 7.49%, at December&nbsp;31, 2003. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, advances on financing facilities
totaled $530.7&nbsp;million, with a weighted average funding cost of 5.05% as compared to $172.5
million, with a weighted average funding cost of 3.40%, at December&nbsp;31, 2003. Additionally, our
joint venture investment portfolio at December&nbsp;31, 2004 was $5.3&nbsp;million as compared to $5.9
million at December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, we purchased $57.4&nbsp;million (including $0.1&nbsp;million of purchased interest) of
agency-sponsored whole pool mortgage-related securities. Pools of FNMA and FHLMC adjustable rate
residential mortgage loans underlie these mortgage-related securities. We receive payments based on
the payments that are made on these mortgage loans. The underlying mortgage loans have a fixed rate
of interest for three years and adjust annually thereafter. These loans have a weighted average
coupon rate of 3.8%. Of these mortgage-related securities, $20.6&nbsp;million were issued by FNMA and
$36.7&nbsp;million were issued by FHLMC. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the amortized cost of these securities
was $47.1&nbsp;million. We are carrying these securities at their estimated fair value of $46.6&nbsp;million,
which resulted in a $0.5&nbsp;million unrealized loss that was recorded in other comprehensive loss. At
December&nbsp;31, 2004, the outstanding balance on the financing of these securities was $44.2&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;19, 2005 the Company completed a non-recourse collateralized debt obligation
(&#147;CDO&#148;) transaction, whereby a portfolio of real estate-related assets were contributed to a
consolidated subsidiary which issued $305&nbsp;million of investment grade-rated floating-rate notes in
a private placement. The subsidiary retained the equity interest in the issuer with a value of
approximately $164&nbsp;million. The notes are secured by a portfolio of real estate-related assets
with a face value of approximately $441&nbsp;million, consisting primarily of bridge loans, mezzanine
loans and junior participating interests in first mortgages, and by approximately $28&nbsp;million of
cash available for acquisitions of loans and other permitted investments. The notes have an
initial weighted average spread of approximately 77 basis points over

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">three-month LIBOR. The facility has a four-year replenishment period that allows the principal
proceeds from repayments of the collateral assets to be reinvested in qualifying replacement
assets, subject to certain conditions. The Company intends to own the portfolio of real
estate-related assets until its maturity and will account for this transaction on its balance sheet
as a financing. These proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt with higher costs of funds. In
connection with the CDO, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its
exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three-month LIBOR and one-month LIBOR.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Sources of Operating Revenues</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We derive our operating revenues primarily through interest received from making
real estate-related bridge and mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments. Interest income
earned on these loans and investments represented approximately 96% and 98% of our total revenues
in 2004 and for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income is also derived from profits of equity participation interests. In 2004,
interest income from participation interests represented approximately $1.2&nbsp;million or 2% of total
revenues. No income was derived from this source in 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also derive interest income from our investments in mortgage related securities. In 2004,
interest on these investments represented approximately 2% of our total revenues. No income was
derived from this source in 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we also derive operating revenues from other income that represents loan
structuring and miscellaneous asset management fees associated with our loans and investments
portfolio. Revenue from other income represented less than 1% and 2% of our total revenues in 2004
and the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Gain on Sale of Loans and Real Estate and Income from Equity Affiliates</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may derive income from the gain on sale of loans and real estate. We may acquire
(1)&nbsp;real estate for our own investment and, upon stabilization, disposition at an anticipated
return and (2)&nbsp;real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the
borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest
certain assets from its portfolio. No such income has been recorded to date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also derive income from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that were formed with
equity partners to acquire, develop and/or sell real estate assets. Such investments are recorded
under the equity method. We record our share of net income from the underlying properties in which
we invest through these joint ventures. In 2004, income from equity affiliates totaled $525,000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management&#146;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based
upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported
amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements, which appear in &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#148; Set forth
below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Certain of the
accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are
particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations
presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require
the application of significant judgment by management and, as a result, are subject to a degree of
uncertainty.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Loans and Investments</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;115 requires that at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held
to maturity, available for sale, or trading depending on ability and intent. Securities held for
sale are reported at fair value, while securities and investments held to maturity are reported at
amortized cost. We do not have any trading securities at this time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at
cost, net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees, unless such loan or investment is deemed
to be impaired. We invest in preferred equity interests that allow us to participate in a
percentage of the underlying property&#146;s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or
refinancing. At the inception of each such investment, management must determine whether such
investment should be accounted for as a loan, joint venture or as real estate. To date, management
has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported as loans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific valuation allowances are established for impaired loans based on the fair value of
collateral on an individual loan basis. The fair value of the collateral is determined by an
evaluation of operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period, and
estimated sales value computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net
operating income of the specific property, less selling costs, discounted at market discount rates.
If upon completion of the valuation, the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the
impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan, an allowance is created with a
corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses. An allowance for each loan would be
maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses. As of December&nbsp;31,
2004, no impairment has been identified and no valuation allowances have been established.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Available-For-Sale Securities</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We invest in agency-sponsored whole pool mortgage related securities. Pools of
Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or
FHLMC, adjustable rate residential mortgage loans underlie these mortgage related securities. We
receive payments from the payments that are made on these underlying mortgage loans, which have a
fixed rate of interest for three years and adjust annually thereafter. These securities are carried
at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported
in other comprehensive income pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;115 &#147;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities.&#148; Unrealized losses other than temporary losses are recognized currently in
income.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Revenue Recognition</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Interest Income. </I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned
from loans, investments and available-for-sale securities. In many instances, the borrower pays an
additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed, an origination fee, and deferred
interest upon maturity. In some cases interest income may also include the amortization or
accretion of premiums and discounts arising at the purchase or origination. This additional income,
net of any direct loan origination costs incurred, is deferred and accreted into interest income on
an effective yield or &#147;interest&#148; method adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the life of
the related loan or available-for-sale security as a yield adjustment. Income recognition is
suspended for loans when in the opinion of management a full recovery of income and principal
becomes doubtful. Income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and
performance is demonstrated to be resumed. Several of the loans provide for accrual of interest at
specified rates, which differ from current payment terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at
the accrual rate subject to management&#146;s determination that accrued interest and outstanding
principal are ultimately collectible, based on the underlying collateral and operations of the
borrower. If management cannot make this determination regarding collectibility, interest income
above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt. Additionally, interest income is
recorded when earned from equity participation interests, referred to as equity kickers. These
equity kickers have the potential to generate

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">additional revenues to the Company as a result of excess cash flows being distributed and/or as
appreciated properties are sold or refinanced.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Derivatives and Hedging Activities</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with FAS 133, the carrying values of interest rate swaps, as well as
the underlying hedged liability, if applicable, are reflected at their fair value. We rely on
quotations from a third party to determine these fair values. Derivatives that are not hedges are
adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the
hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in the fair
value of the hedged liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until
the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative&#146;s change in fair
value is immediately recognized in earnings.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the valuations of our hedging activities are based on estimates, the fair value may
change if our estimates are inaccurate. For the effect of hypothetical changes in market interest
rates on our interest rate swaps, see the Market Risk section.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued FASB
Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, &#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities&#148; (&#147;FIN 46&#148;), which requires a
variable interest entity (&#147;VIE&#148;) to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary (&#147;PB&#148;). The PB is
the party that absorbs a majority of the VIE&#146;s anticipated losses and/or a majority of the expected
returns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 (&#147;FIN 46(R)&#148;), delaying the effective date for
certain entities created before February&nbsp;1, 2003 and making other amendments to clarify the
application of the guidance. FIN 46(R) is effective no later than the end of the first interim or
annual period ending after December&nbsp;15, 2003 for entities created after January&nbsp;31, 2003 and for
entities created before February&nbsp;1, 2003, no later than the end of the first interim or annual
period ending after March&nbsp;15, 2004. As required, we adopted the guidance of FIN 46(R) accordingly.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In adopting FIN 46 and FIN 46(R), we have evaluated our loans and investments and investments
in equity affiliates to determine whether they are VIE&#146;s. This evaluation resulted in us
determining that our mezzanine loans, preferred equity investments and investments in equity
affiliates were potential variable interests. For each of these investments, we have evaluated (1)
the sufficiency of the fair value of the entities&#146; equity investments at risk to absorb losses, (2)
that as a group the holders of the equity investments at risk have (a)&nbsp;the direct or indirect
ability through voting rights to make decisions about the entities&#146; significant activities, (b)&nbsp;the
obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity and their obligations are not protected
directly or indirectly, (c)&nbsp;the right to receive the expected residual return of the entity and
their rights are not capped, (3)&nbsp;the voting rights of some of these investors are proportional to
their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity, their rights to receive the expected
returns of the equity, or both, and (4)&nbsp;that substantially all of the entities&#146; activities do not
involve or are not conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting
rights. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, we have identified four loans and investments which were made to
entities determined to be VIE&#146;s. A summary of our identified VIE&#146;s is presented in Note 2 of our
consolidated financial statements, which appear in &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148;.
For the four VIE&#146;s identified, we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiaries and as
such the VIE&#146;s should not be consolidated in our financial statements. For all other investments,
we have determined they are not VIE&#146;s. As such, we have continued to account for these loans and
investments as a loan or joint venture, as appropriate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, the SEC released SAB 105, &#147;Application of Accounting Principles to Loan
Commitments,&#148; providing guidance on how to account for a commitment to purchase a mortgage loan
prior to funding the loan. SAB 105 requires that these commitments be recorded at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in current earnings and was intended to eliminate the diversity in
industry practice that existed relating to the accounting for loan commitments. SAB 105 is
effective for loan commitments

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">entered into after March&nbsp;31, 2004. Our method of accounting for loan commitments is consistent with
the guidance provided by SAB 105.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 03-3, &#147;Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities
Acquired in a Transfer.&#148; SOP 03-3 addresses the accounting for acquired impaired loans, which are
loans that show evidence of having deteriorated in terms of credit quality since their origination.
SOP 03-3 is effective for loans acquired after December&nbsp;31, 2004. We do not expect the adoption of
SOP 03-3 to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued EITF 03-01, &#147;The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
Its Application to Certain Investments.&#148; EITF 03-01 requires an investor to determine when an
investment is considered impaired, evaluate whether that impairment is other than temporary, and,
if the impairment is other than temporary, recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference
between the investment&#146;s cost and its fair value. The guidance also includes accounting
considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires
certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary
impairments. The impairment loss recognition and measurement guidance was to be applicable to
other-than-temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2004. In
September&nbsp;2004, the FASB proposed additional guidance related to debt securities that are impaired
because of interest rate and/or sector spread increases, and delayed the effective date of EITF
03-01. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 03-01 to have a material effect on our financial
condition, results of operations, or liquidity. EITF 03-01 also includes disclosure requirements
for investments in an unrealized loss position for which other-than-temporary impairments have not
been recognized. These disclosures are included in our report for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004
as required by the EITF.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB published SFAS 123(R) entitled &#147;Share-Based Payment.&#148; It requires
all public companies to report share-based compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the
related share-based awards. We are required to adopt the provisions of the standard effective for
periods beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2005. We believe that our current method of accounting for
share-based payments is consistent with SFAS 123(R).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income increased $47.9&nbsp;million, or 479%, to $57.9&nbsp;million in 2004 from $10.0&nbsp;million
for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This increase was due to a full year&#146;s results in 2004 as
compared to a partial year&#146;s results in 2003, a 149% increase in the average balance of the loan
and investment portfolio from $254.9&nbsp;million for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 to $635.1
million in 2004 due to increased loan and investment originations, as
well as a 14% increase in the
average yield on the assets from 7.7% to 8.8% as a result of increased market interest rates. In
addition, interest income in 2004 included a $1.2&nbsp;million participation interest earned and
received on one of our loans as compared to no participation interest recorded during the period
ending December&nbsp;31, 2003. Interest income from available for sale securities in 2004 was $1.1
million, with an average available for sale securities balance of $51.9&nbsp;million and an average
yield of 2.1%. There was no interest income recorded from available for sale securities during the
period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other income decreased $114,000, or 73%, to $42,000 in 2004 from $157,000 for the period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2003. This income represents loan structuring and miscellaneous asset management fees
associated with our loan and investment portfolio.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Expenses</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense increased $17.7&nbsp;million, or 1060%, to $19.4&nbsp;million in 2004 from $1.7&nbsp;million
for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This increase was due to a full year&#146;s results in 2004 as
compared to a partial year&#146;s results in 2003, a 315% increase in the average debt financing on our
loan and investment portfolio from $92.5&nbsp;million for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 to $383.8
million in 2004 due to increased loan and portfolio originations, as
well as a 37% increase in the
average cost of these borrowings from 3.5% to 4.8% as a result of increased market interest rates.
In addition, interest expense on debt financing of our available-for-sale securities portfolio in
2004 was $0.6&nbsp;million, with an average debt financing on our available for sale securities balance
of $50.3&nbsp;million and an average yield of 1.24%. There

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">was no interest expense recorded from available for sale securities during the period ended
December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $1.4&nbsp;million, or 147%, to $2.3&nbsp;million in
2004 from $0.9&nbsp;million for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This increase was due to a full
year&#146;s results in 2004 as compared to a partial year&#146;s results in 2003 combined with the expansion
of staffing needs associated with strengthening our organization as a publicly traded company in
2004. These expenses represent salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation for those employed by
us during these periods.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock-based compensation expense decreased $1.4&nbsp;million, or 82%, to $0.3&nbsp;million in 2004 from
$1.7&nbsp;million for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This decrease was primarily due to a greater
portion of the restricted stock grants vesting for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 partially
offset by a full year&#146;s results in 2004 as compared to a partial year&#146;s results in 2003. This
expense represents the cost of restricted stock granted to certain of our employees, executive
officers and directors and certain executive officers and employees of our manager. Of the total
shares granted, two-thirds of the shares granted vested immediately and the remaining one-third
vests over three years. The amount of compensation expense recorded for the period ended December
31, 2003 represents the full expense of the initial two-thirds vesting and a ratable portion of the
expense of the unvested shares. The amount of expense in 2004 represents a ratable portion of the
expense of the unvested shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling and administrative expense increased $1.4&nbsp;million, or 258%, to $1.9&nbsp;million in 2004
from $0.5&nbsp;million for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This increase was directly attributable
to a full year&#146;s results in 2004 as compared to a partial year&#146;s results in 2003 combined with an
increase in professional fees, including legal and accounting services, insurance expense and
director&#146;s fees associated with operating a public company since our filing in 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management fees increased $3.0&nbsp;million, or 515%, to $3.6&nbsp;million in 2004 from $2.0&nbsp;million for
the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This increase was directly attributable to a full year&#146;s
results in 2004 as compared to a partial year&#146;s results in 2003, combined with $1.6&nbsp;million in
incentive management fees recorded in 2004 not earned during the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 due
to the requirements for incentive compensation not satisfied, as well as an increase in the average
base management fees associated with increased stockholder&#146;s equity directly attributable to
greater profits and contributed capital.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Income From Equity Affiliates</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income from equity affiliates was $525,000 in 2004. This amount represents an allocation of
income from one of our joint venture interests. For the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, no income
from equity affiliates was recorded.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Income Allocated to Minority Interest</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income allocated to minority interest increased $4.6&nbsp;million, or 349%, to $5.9&nbsp;million in 2004
from $1.3&nbsp;million for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. These amounts represent the portion of
our income allocated to our manager. This increase was due to a full year&#146;s results in 2004 as
compared to a partial year&#146;s results in 2003, combined with a 556% increase in income before
minority interest, partially offset by a decrease in our manager&#146;s limited partnership interest in
us. Our manager owned a 18.7% and 27.7% limited partnership interest in our operating partnership
and was allocated 18.7% and 27.7% at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Sources of Liquidity</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquidity is a measurement of the ability to meet potential cash requirements,
including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund loans and investments and other general
business needs. Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of funds raised from our private
equity offering in July&nbsp;2003,

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">net proceeds from our initial public offering of our common stock in April&nbsp;2004, the issuance of
floating rate notes pursuant to a CDO (described below) in January&nbsp;2005, borrowings under credit
agreements, net cash provided by operating activities, repayments of outstanding loans and
investments, funds from junior and senior loan participation arrangements and the future issuance
of common, convertible and/or preferred equity securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, we received gross proceeds from the private placement totaling $120.2&nbsp;million, which
combined with ACM&#146;s equity contribution of $43.9&nbsp;million, resulted in total contributed capital of
$164.1&nbsp;million. These proceeds were used to pay down borrowings under our existing credit
facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, we sold 6,750,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering on April&nbsp;13, 2004
for net proceeds of approximately $125.4&nbsp;million. We used the proceeds to pay down indebtedness. In
addition, in May&nbsp;2004 the underwriters exercised a portion of their over allotment option, which
resulted in the issuance of 524,200 additional shares for net proceeds of approximately $9.8
million. Additionally, in 2004, 1.3&nbsp;million common stock warrants were exercised which resulted in
proceeds of $12.9&nbsp;million. Also, Arbor Realty Limited Partnership (&#147;ARLP&#148;), the operating
partnership of Arbor Realty Trust received proceeds of $9.4&nbsp;million from the exercise of ACM&#146;s
warrants for a total of 629,345 operating partnership units.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also maintain liquidity through one warehouse credit agreement, one unsecured revolving
credit agreement, five master repurchase agreements, and one secured term credit facility with
seven different financial institutions. London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, refers to
one-month LIBOR unless specifically stated.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a $250.0&nbsp;million warehouse credit agreement with a financial institution, dated as of
July&nbsp;1, 2003, with a term of three years and bears interest at LIBOR plus pricing of 2.00% to
2.75%, varying on type of asset financed. In the event this facility is not renewed, we have nine
months to repay all outstanding advances. In addition to LIBOR-based interest obligations, this
warehouse credit facility includes a profit sharing agreement, whereby the institution shares in
the net interest spread of the assets financed. The profit sharing component represents the
percentage of the net profits earned over the life of a loan that are payable to the lender upon
repayment of the underlying investment. Net profits are based on interest income, interest expense
and deferred interest payable at repayment of an investment. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the outstanding
balance under this facility was $137.2&nbsp;million with a current weighted average note rate of 4.87%.
On January&nbsp;19, 2005, $36&nbsp;million of this facility was paid down in connection with the CDO (see
below). In addition, on March&nbsp;29, 2005 we terminated this facility scheduled to expire in June,
2006. We simultaneously repaid all indebtedness outstanding on that date. This debt underlying
certain of our assets was transferred to our other facilities described below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a $100.0&nbsp;million master repurchase agreement with a second financial institution, as
amended in December&nbsp;2004, that has a term expiring in June&nbsp;2005 and bears interest at LIBOR plus
pricing of 2.00% to 2.75%, varying on type of asset financed. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the outstanding
balance under this facility was $19.5&nbsp;million with a current weighted average note rate of 5.43%.
Subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2004, $7&nbsp;million of this facility was paid down in connection with the
CDO (see below).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a $350.0&nbsp;million master repurchase agreement with Wachovia Bank National Association,
dated as of December&nbsp;23, 2003, with a term of three years and bears interest at LIBOR plus pricing
of 0.94% to 3.65%, varying on type of asset financed. In July&nbsp;2004, this repurchase agreement was
amended increasing the amount of available financing from $250&nbsp;million to $350&nbsp;million and amending
certain terms of this agreement, which were generally more favorable to us. This amendment has a
expiration date of July&nbsp;2005. In December&nbsp;2004, we amended this facility on a temporary basis which
provided for an increase in the amount of financing available under this facility from $350&nbsp;million
to $430&nbsp;million, and expired in February&nbsp;2005. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the outstanding balance under
this facility was $324.4&nbsp;million with a current weighted average note rate of 4.63%. Subsequent to
December&nbsp;31, 2004, $203&nbsp;million of this facility was paid down in connection with the CDO (see
below). In addition, we have a $100&nbsp;million repurchase agreement with the same financial
institution as above that we entered into for the purpose of financing our securities available for
sale. This agreement expires on July&nbsp;2005 and has an

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.15%. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the outstanding balance under this
facility was $44.2&nbsp;million with a current weighted average note rate of 2.36%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We entered into a $21&nbsp;million repurchase agreement with a fourth financial institution, dated
July&nbsp;30, 2004 for the purpose of financing a $30&nbsp;million mezzanine loan which was purchased from
this institution. The agreement provides for a 70% advance rate of the current loan balance,
interest to be paid monthly at LIBOR plus 1.50%, and has a term that will expire in April&nbsp;2005.
Subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2004, this loan was contributed to the portfolio of the CDO and the debt
financing was paid in full (see below).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a $50.0&nbsp;million master repurchase agreement with a fifth financial institution, dated
as of July&nbsp;1, 2003, which matures in November&nbsp;2005 and bears interest at LIBOR plus pricing of
2.00% to 2.75%, varying on type of asset financed. This facility has not yet been utilized.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a $50.0&nbsp;million unsecured revolving credit agreement with a sixth financial
institution, dated December&nbsp;7, 2004, with a term of one year with two one-year extension options
and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 7.00%. This revolving credit facility is primarily used to
manage the timing difference between when new loans and investments are closed and when they are
financed within one of the warehouse credit or master repurchase agreements. At December&nbsp;31, 2004,
the outstanding balance under this facility was $15.0&nbsp;million with a current weighted average note
rate of 9.37%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2005, we closed a $50&nbsp;million term credit facility with a seventh financial
institution who beneficially owned approximately 7.1% of our outstanding common stock as of
December&nbsp;31, 2004. This agreement has a term of one year with two six-month renewal options and
bears interest at LIBOR plus 6.00%. On February&nbsp;28, 2005, the outstanding balance under this
facility was $30.0&nbsp;million with a current weighted average note rate of 8.72%.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2005, we completed a non-recourse collateralized debt obligation (&#147;CDO&#148;)
transaction, whereby $469&nbsp;million of real estate related and other assets were contributed to a
newly-formed consolidated subsidiary which issued $305&nbsp;million of investment grade-rated
floating-rate notes in a private placement. These proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt
under our current facilities totaling $267&nbsp;million. By contributing these real estate assets to the
CDO, this transaction resulted in a decreased cost of funds relating to the CDO assets and created
capacity in our existing credit facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;15, 2005, we, through a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of its operating
partnership, issued $27.1&nbsp;million of junior subordinated notes in a private placement. These
securities are unsecured, have a maturity of 29&nbsp;years, pay interest quarterly at a floating rate of
interest based on LIBOR and, absent the occurrence of special events, are not redeemable during the
first five years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warehouse credit agreement, unsecured revolving credit agreement, and the master
repurchase agreements require that we pay interest monthly, based on pricing over LIBOR. The amount
of our pricing over LIBOR varies depending upon the structure of the loan or investment financed
pursuant to the warehouse credit agreement or the master repurchase agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warehouse credit agreement, the master repurchase agreements and the secured term credit
facility require that we pay down borrowings under these facilities pro-rata as principal payments
on our loans and investments are received. In addition, if upon maturity of a loan or investment we
decide to grant the borrower an extension option, the financial institutions have the option to
extend the borrowings or request payment in full on the outstanding borrowings of the loan or
investment extended. The financial institutions also have the right to request immediate payment of
any outstanding borrowings on any loan or investment that is at least 60&nbsp;days delinquent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, these facilities had an aggregate capacity of $1.0&nbsp;billion and
borrowings were approximately $561.3&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
of the credit facilities contains various financials covenants and
restrictions, including minimum net worth and debt-to-equity ratios. In addition to the financial terms and capacities described above, our credit facilities
generally contain covenants that prohibit us from effecting a change in control, disposing of or
encumbering assets being

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">financed and restrict us from making any material amendment to our underwriting guidelines without
approval of the lender. If we violate these covenants in any of our credit facilities, we could be
required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be
unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms, if at all. Violations of these
covenants may result in our being unable to borrow unused amounts under our credit facilities, even
if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004 we are in
compliance with all covenants and restrictions under these credit facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have entered into two junior loan participations with a total outstanding
balance at December&nbsp;31, 2004 of $10.6&nbsp;million. These participation borrowings have maturity dates
equal to the corresponding mortgage loan and are secured by the participant&#146;s interest in the
mortgage loan. Interest expense is based on a portion of the interest received from the loan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We entered into one senior loan participation with a total outstanding balance as of December
31, 2004 of $3.0&nbsp;million. Interest expense relating to this senior participation was based on 50%
of the net spread on the loan. In January&nbsp;2005, the senior loan participation was repaid in full.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our
short-term liquidity (within one year) and long-term liquidity needs. Our short-term and long-term
liquidity needs include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund future investments, fund
operating costs and fund distributions to our stockholders. Our loans and investments are financed
under existing credit facilities and their credit status is continuously monitored; therefore,
these loans and investments are expected to generate a generally stable return. Our ability to meet
our long-term liquidity and capital resource requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt
and equity financing. If we are unable to renew our sources of financing on substantially similar
terms or at all, it would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any
decision by our lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a
number of factors, such as our financial performance, compliance with the terms of our existing
credit arrangements, industry or market trends, the general availability of and rates applicable to
financing transactions, such lenders&#146; and investors&#146; resources and policies concerning the terms
under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative
investment or lending opportunities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we must distribute annually
at least 90% of our taxable income. These distribution requirements limit our ability to retain
earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations. However, we believe that our
significant capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility
and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital
requirements, including expected new lending and investment opportunities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to maximize the return on our funds, cash generated from operations is generally used
to temporarily pay down borrowings under credit facilities whose primary purpose is to fund our new
loans and investments. When making distributions, we borrow the required funds by drawing on credit
capacity available under our credit facilities. To date, all distributions have been funded in this
manner. All funds borrowed to make distributions have been repaid by funds generated from
operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Base Management Fees. </I>In exchange for the services that ACM provides us pursuant to the
management agreement, we pay our manager a monthly base management fee in an amount equal to:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(1)&nbsp;0.75% per annum of the first $400&nbsp;million of our operating partnership&#146;s equity (equal the
month-end value computed in accordance with GAAP of total partners&#146; equity in our operating

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base management fee is not calculated based on the manager&#146;s performance or the types of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, our manager earned a total of $1.6&nbsp;million of incentive compensation and elected to
receive it in 66,141 shares of common stock. Our manager did not earn incentive compensation for
the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pay the annual incentive compensation in four installments, each within 60&nbsp;days of the end
of each fiscal quarter. The calculation of each installment is based on results for the 12&nbsp;months
ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the installment is payable. These
installments of the annual incentive compensation are subject to recalculation and potential
reconciliation at the end of such fiscal year. Subject to the ownership limitations in our
charter, at least 25% of this incentive compensation is payable to our manager in shares of our
common stock having a value equal to the average closing price per share for the last twenty days
of the fiscal quarter for which the incentive compensation is being paid.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incentive compensation is accrued as it is earned. In accordance with Issue 4(b) of EITF
96-18, &#147;Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or
in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services,&#148; the expense incurred for incentive compensation
paid in common stock is determined using the valuation method described above and the quoted market
price of our common stock on the last day of each quarter. At December&nbsp;31 of each year, we
remeasure the incentive compensation paid to our manager in the form of common stock in accordance
with Issue 4(a) of EITF 96-18 which discusses how to measure at the measurement date when certain
terms are not known prior to the measurement date. Accordingly, the expense recorded for such
common stock is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date when
the final calculation of the annual incentive compensation is determined. In the event that the
annual incentive compensation calculated as of the measurement date is less than the four quarterly
installments of the annual incentive compensation paid in advance, our manager will refund the
amount of such overpayment in cash and we would record a negative incentive compensation expense in
the quarter when such overpayment is determined.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Origination Fees. </I>Our manager is entitled to 100% of the origination fees paid by borrowers
under each of our bridge loan and mezzanine loans that do not exceed 1% of the loan&#146;s principal
amount. We retain 100% of the origination fee that exceeds 1% of the loan&#146;s principal amount.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Term and Termination. </I>The management agreement has an initial term of two years and is
renewable automatically for an additional one year period every year thereafter, unless terminated
with six months&#146; prior written notice. If we terminate or elect not to renew the management
agreement in order to manage our portfolio internally, we are required to pay a termination fee
equal to the base management fee and incentive compensation for the 12-month period preceding the
termination. If, without cause, we terminate or elect not to renew the management agreement for
any other reason, including a change of control of us, we are required to pay a termination fee
equal to two times the base management fee and incentive compensation paid for the 12-month period
preceding the termination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Inflation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our two most recent fiscal years, inflation and changing prices have not had a material

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, we had a $7.75&nbsp;million first mortgage loan and as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003, this first mortgage loan had an outstanding principal amount of $13.5&nbsp;million
and we had a $1.2&nbsp;million second mortgage loan, each of which bore interest at a variable rate of
one month LIBOR plus 4.25% and matures in March&nbsp;2005. Each of these loans were made to a
not-for-profit corporation that holds and manages investment property from the endowment of a
private academic institution. Two of our directors are members of the board of trustees of the
borrower under each of these loans and the private academic institution. Interest income recorded
from these loans in 2004 and 2003 was approximately $0.9&nbsp;million and $0.4&nbsp;million, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACM has a 50% non-controlling interest in a joint venture, which was formed to acquire,
develop and/or sell real estate assets. At December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, ACM&#146;s investment in this
joint venture was approximately $2.6&nbsp;million. All loans outstanding to this joint venture were
repaid in full in 2004. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, we had a $16.0&nbsp;million bridge loan outstanding to the
joint venture, which was collateralized by a first lien position on a commercial real estate
property. This loan was funded by ACM in June&nbsp;2003 and was purchased by us in July&nbsp;2003. The loan
required monthly interest payments based on one month LIBOR and was repaid in full in 2004. We had
agreed to provide the borrower with additional mezzanine financing in the amount of up to $8.0
million. The mezzanine financing required interest payments based on one month LIBOR and was repaid
in full in 2004. Interest income recorded from these loans for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2004
and 2003 was approximately $0.8&nbsp;million and $0.5&nbsp;million, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our $16.0&nbsp;million bridge loan to the joint venture was contributed by ACM as one of the
structured finance assets contributed to us on July&nbsp;1, 2003 at book value, which approximates fair
value. At the time of contribution, ACM also agreed to provide a limited guarantee of the loan&#146;s
principal amount based any profits realized on its retained 50% interest in the joint venture with
the borrower and ACM&#146;s participating interests in borrowers under three other contributed
structured finance assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of ACM&#146;s origination of three of the structured finance assets that it contributed
to us on July&nbsp;1, 2003 at book value, which approximates fair value, each of the property owners
related to these contributed assets granted ACM participating interests that share in a percentage
of the cash flows of the underlying properties. Upon contribution of the structured finance assets,
ACM retained these participating interests and its 50% non-controlling interest in the joint
venture to which it had made the $16.0&nbsp;million bridge loan. ACM agreed that if any portion of the
outstanding amount of any of these four contributed assets is not paid at its maturity or
repurchase date, ACM will pay to us, subject to the limitation described below, the portion of the
unpaid amount of the contributed asset up to the total amount then received by ACM due to the
realization of any profits on its retained interests associated with any other of the four
contributed assets (which had an aggregate balance of $48.3&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003).
However, ACM will no longer be obligated to make such payments to us when the remaining accumulated
principal amount of the four contributed assets, collectively, falls below $5&nbsp;million and none of
the four contributed assets are in default. In 2004, two of these investments matured and the
borrowers paid the amount due in full. The remaining two investments have an aggregate balance of
$22.3&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, approximately $0.3&nbsp;million of interest payments from borrowers due
from ACM was included in other assets. These payments were remitted in January&nbsp;2005. As of December
31, 2004, approximately $0.6&nbsp;million of interest reserve payments due to ACM was included in other
liabilities. These payments were remitted in January&nbsp;2005.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, ACM received a brokerage fee for services rendered in arranging a loan facility for a
borrower. A portion of the loan facility was provided by us. We were credited $0.1&nbsp;million of this
brokerage fee which represented our proportionate share of the loan facility provided to the
borrower and is included in other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2003, which was received in January&nbsp;2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Other Related Party Transactions</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACM contributed the majority of its structured finance portfolio to our operating
partnership pursuant to a contribution agreement. The contribution agreement contains
representations and warranties concerning the ownership and terms of the structured finance assets
it contributed and other customary matters. ACM has agreed to indemnify us and our operating
partnership against breaches of those representations and warranties. In connection with its asset
contribution ACM has also agreed to guaranty a portion of the principal amount of four contributed
assets in which ACM has retained a participating interest or a joint venture interest in the
borrower. In 2004, two of these investments matured and the borrowers paid the amounts due in full.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange for ACM&#146;s asset contribution, we issued to ACM approximately 3.1&nbsp;million operating
partnership units, each of which ACM may redeem for one share of our common stock or an equivalent
amount in cash, at our election, and approximately 629,000 warrants, each of which entitles ACM to
purchase one additional operating partnership unit at an initial exercise price of $15.00. The
operating partnership units and warrants for additional operating partnership units issued to ACM
were valued at approximately $43.9&nbsp;million at July&nbsp;1, 2003, based on the price offered to investors
in our units in the private placement, adjusted for the initial purchaser&#146;s discount. We also
granted ACM certain demand and other registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock
issuable upon redemption of its operating partnership units. In October&nbsp;2004, ACM exercised all of
its warrants for a total of 629,345 operating partnership units and proceeds of $9.4&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the approximately 3.7&nbsp;million operating partnership units owned by ACM is paired with
one share of our special voting preferred stock that entitles the holder to one vote on all matters
submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As operating partnership units are redeemed for shares of
our common stock or cash an equivalent number of shares of special voting preferred stock will be
redeemed and cancelled. As a result of the ACM asset contribution and the related formation
transactions, ACM owns approximately a 19% limited partnership interest in our operating
partnership and the remaining 81% interest in our operating partnership is owned by us. In
addition, ACM has approximately 19% of the voting power of our outstanding stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We and our operating partnership have entered into a management agreement with ACM pursuant to
which ACM has agreed to provide us with structured finance investment opportunities and loan
servicing as well as other services necessary to operate our business. As discussed above in &#145;&#145;&#151;
Contractual Commitments,&#146;&#146; we have agreed to pay our manager an annual base management fee and
incentive compensation each fiscal quarter and share with ACM a portion of the origination fees
that we receive on loans we originate with ACM pursuant to this agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the management agreement, ACM is also required to provide us with a right
of first refusal with respect to all structured finance transactions identified by ACM or its
affiliates. We have agreed not to pursue, and to allow ACM to pursue, any real estate opportunities
other than structured finance transactions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Kaufman has entered into a non-competition agreement with us pursuant to
which he has agreed not to pursue structured finance investment opportunities, except as approved
by our board of directors.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS OF<BR>
ARBOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report
entitled &#147;Risk Factors&#148;, &#147;Forward-Looking Statements&#148; and &#147;Selected Consolidated Financial
Information of the Structured Finance Business of Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC and Subsidiaries&#148;
and the historical consolidated financial statements of the structured finance business of Arbor
Commercial Mortgage, including related notes, included elsewhere in this report.</I>


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Overview and Basis of Presentation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003 ACM contributed a portfolio of structured finance investments and related
liabilities to our operating partnership. In addition, certain employees of ACM related to its
structured finance business became our employees. These assets, liabilities and employees
represented a substantial portion of ACM&#146;s structured finance business, which historically invested
in real estate related bridge and mezzanine loans, preferred equity and other real estate related
assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structured finance business of ACM is not a separate legal entity and the assets and
liabilities associated with ACM&#146;s structured finance business are components of a larger business.
We obtained the information in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
report from ACM&#146;s consolidated historical accounting records.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structured finance business of ACM never operated as a separate business segment or
division of ACM, but as an integrated part of ACM&#146;s consolidated business. Accordingly, the
statements of revenue and direct operating expenses do not include charges from ACM for corporate
general and administrative expense because ACM considered such items to be corporate expenses and
did not allocate them to individual business units. These expenses included costs for ACM&#146;s
executive management, corporate facilities and overhead costs, corporate accounting and treasury
functions, corporate legal matters and other similar costs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information in the statements of revenue and direct operating expenses include the revenue
and direct operating expenses that relate to the structured finance business. Direct operating
expenses include interest expense applicable to the funding costs of the structured finance
business loans and investments, salaries and related fringe benefit costs, provision for loan
losses and other expenses directly associated with revenue-generating activities. Direct operating
expenses also include allocations of certain expenses, such as telephone, office equipment rental
and maintenance, office supplies and marketing, which were directly associated with the structured
finance business and were allocated based on headcount of the structured finance business in
relation to the total headcount of ACM. All of these allocations are based on assumptions that
management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements in this report do not include a statement of cash flows
because the structured finance business did not maintain a separate cash balance. Other than the
debt required to fund the loans and investments of the structured finance business, operating
activities of the structured finance business were funded by ACM.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the structured finance business never operated as a separate business division or
segment of ACM, the consolidated financial statements included in this report are not intended to
be a complete presentation of the historical financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of the structured finance business. These consolidated financial statements were prepared for
inclusion in this report and do not purport to reflect the financial position or results of
operations that would have resulted if the structured finance business had operated as a separate
company. The historical consolidated financial information included in this report is not likely to
be indicative of our financial position, results of operations or cash

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">flows for any future period. See &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Our historical consolidated financial information
is not likely to be indicative of our future performance or financial position as a separate
company.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Sources of Operating Revenues</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We derive our operating revenues primarily from interest received from making real estate
related bridge and mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments. We provide bridge loans
secured by first lien mortgages on the property to borrowers who are typically seeking short term
capital to be used in an acquisition of property. The bridge loans we make typically range in size
from $1&nbsp;million to $25&nbsp;million and have terms of up to seven years. We provide real property owners
with mezzanine loans that are secured by pledges of ownership interests in entities that directly
or indirectly control the real property or second mortgages. These loans typically range in size
from $2&nbsp;million to $15&nbsp;million and have terms of up to seven years. We also make preferred equity
investments in entities that directly or indirectly own real property. Interest represented 83% and
93% of total revenue for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003 and June&nbsp;30, 2002, respectively.
Interest represented 93% and 90% of total revenue for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 and
December&nbsp;31, 2001, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also derive operating revenue from other income that includes several types of income that
are recorded upon receipt. Certain of our loans and investments provide for additional payments
based on the borrower&#146;s operating cash flow, appreciation of the underlying collateral, payments
calculated based on timing of when the loan pays off and changes in interest rates. Such amounts
are not readily determinable and are recorded as other income upon receipt. Other income also
includes the recognition of deferred revenue on loans that prepay, asset management fees related to
our loans and investment portfolio and satisfactions on impaired loans in excess of carrying
values. Other income represented 17% and 7% of total revenue for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003
and June&nbsp;30, 2002, respectively. Other income represented 7% and 10% of total revenue for the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 and December&nbsp;31, 2001, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Gain on Sale of Loans and Real Estate and Income from Equity Affiliates</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also derive income from the gain on sale of loans and real estate. We acquire (1)&nbsp;real
estate for our own investment and, upon stabilization, disposition at an anticipated return and (2)
real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to
restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest certain assets from
its portfolio.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we derive income from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that ACM&#146;s
structured finance business formed with equity partners to lend to, acquire, develop and/or sell
real estate assets. These investments are recorded under the equity method. We record our share of
net income from the underlying properties invested in through these joint ventures.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical
to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Certain of the
accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are
particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations
presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require
the application of significant judgment by management and, as a result, are subject to a degree of
uncertainty.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Real Estate Owned</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate owned represents commercial real estate property that the structured finance
business of ACM owns and operates. Such assets are not depreciated and are carried at the lower of
cost or fair value less cost to sell. Management reviews its real estate assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at
cost, net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees, unless such loan or investment is deemed
to be impaired.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACM&#146;s structured finance business historically invested in preferred equity interests that
allowed ACM to participate in a percentage of the underlying property&#146;s cash flows from operations
and proceeds from a sale or refinancing. At the inception of each such investment, management must
determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan, joint venture or as real
estate. To date, management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and
reported as loans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific valuation allowances are established for impaired loans based on the fair value of
collateral on an individual loan basis. The fair value of the collateral is determined by an
evaluation of operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period, and
estimated sales value computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net
operating income of the specific property, less selling costs, discounted at market discount rates.
If upon completion of the valuation, the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the
impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan, an allowance is created with a
corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses. The allowance for each loan is maintained at
a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue recognition policies for ACM&#146;s structured finance business are as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Interest Income. </I></B>Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned. In most
instances, the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed, an
origination fee, and deferred interest upon maturity of the loan. This additional income as well as
any direct loan origination costs incurred, is deferred and recognized over the life of the related
loan as a yield adjustment. Income recognition is suspended for loans when in the opinion of
management a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful. Income recognition is resumed
when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. Several
of the loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates, which differ from current payment
terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management&#146;s
determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible, based on
the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower. If management cannot make this
determination regarding collectibility, interest income is recognized only upon actual receipt.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income increased $0.2&nbsp;million, or 3%, to $7.7&nbsp;million for the six months
ended June&nbsp;30, 2003 from $7.5&nbsp;million for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2002. This increase was
primarily due to a 21% increase in the weighted average balance of loans and investment partially
offset by a 15% decrease in the weighted average effective interest rate of loans and investments
primarily due to a decline in market interest rates. Most of our loans and investments are variable
rate instruments based on LIBOR. The negative impact to interest income as a result of the decrease
in market interest rates was partially offset by interest rate floors that were in effect on many
of our loans and investments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other income increased $1.0&nbsp;million, or 180%, to $1.6&nbsp;million for the six months ended June
30, 2003 from $0.6&nbsp;million for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2002. This increase was primarily
attributable to (a)&nbsp;the partial satisfaction of an impaired loan for an amount $0.4&nbsp;million in
excess of the loan&#146;s carrying value resulting in the recognition of other income for this amount
(b)&nbsp;increased funds received on paid off loans of $0.3&nbsp;million and (c)&nbsp;increased accelerated
amortization of revenue of $0.4&nbsp;million on loans with early payoffs.

months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003 from $3.4&nbsp;million for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2002. This increase
is primarily attributable to a 26% increase in the weighted average borrowings partially offset by
a 19% decrease in the weighted average effective financing rate primarily due to a decline in
market interest rates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee compensation and benefits increased $0.3&nbsp;million, or 24%, to $1.8&nbsp;million for the six
months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003 from $1.4&nbsp;million for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2002. This increase
reflects increased staffing levels associated with the increased loan and investments
opportunities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling and administrative expenses increased $0.1&nbsp;million, or 24%, to $0.5&nbsp;million for the

increase was primarily attributable to operating expenses incurred in 2003 for a real estate owned

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income decreased $0.1&nbsp;million, or 1%, to $14.5&nbsp;million for 2002 from
$14.7&nbsp;million for 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a 16% decrease in the weighted average
effective interest rate of loans and investments primarily due to a decline in market interest
rates partially offset by a 17% increase in the weighted average balance of loans and investment.
Most of our loans and investments are variable rates instruments based on LIBOR. The negative
impact to interest income as a result of the decrease in market interest rates was partially offset
by interest rate floors that were in effect on many of our loans and investments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other income decreased $0.6&nbsp;million, or 35%, to $1.1&nbsp;million for 2002 from $1.7&nbsp;million for
2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreased extension fees earned of $0.2&nbsp;million
and decreased funds received on paid off loans of $0.4&nbsp;million.

million for 2002 from $3.2&nbsp;million for 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to a $6.8
million gain on the sale of a joint venture interest in March&nbsp;2002 partially offset by a $2.2
million gain from the sale of property from a joint venture interest and a $0.3&nbsp;million decrease in
income from the sale of foreclosed loans.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were formed in June&nbsp;2003 to operate as a real estate investment trust and to expand the
structured finance business of ACM. On July&nbsp;1, 2003, we completed a private placement of our units,
each consisting of five shares of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our
common stock. Gross

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">proceeds from the private placement totaled $120.2&nbsp;million. In exchange for a commensurate equity
ownership in our operating subsidiary, ACM contributed $213.1&nbsp;million of structured finance assets
subject to $169.2&nbsp;million of borrowings supported by $43.9&nbsp;million of equity. These assets and
liabilities were contributed at book value, which approximates fair value, and represent 88% of the
assets and 98% of the liabilities of ACM&#146;s structured finance business as of June&nbsp;30, 2003. In
addition, certain employees of ACM were transferred to us.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are externally managed and advised by ACM and pay ACM a management fee in accordance with
the terms of the management agreement. ACM also sources originations, provides underwriting
services and services all structured finance assets on our behalf. As a result, the operating
expenses as presented in the historical consolidated financial statements of ACM&#146;s structured
finance business would have been affected had we been formed at an earlier time. Employee
compensation and benefits expense would have decreased by $0.9&nbsp;million and $1.5&nbsp;million for the six
months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003 and year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002, respectively, because these costs
would have been borne by ACM under terms of the management agreement. Similarly, selling and
administrative expense would have decreased by $0.1&nbsp;million and $0.1&nbsp;million for the six months
ended June&nbsp;30, 2003 and year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the management agreement, we will pay ACM a management fee, composed of a
base management fee and incentive compensation. The base management fee is 0.75% per annum of the
first $400&nbsp;million of equity. The incentive compensation is equal to (1)&nbsp;25% of the amount that our
funds from operations per operating partnership unit, adjusted for certain gains and losses,
exceeds the product of (x)&nbsp;9.5% per annum or the Ten Year U.S. Treasury Rate plus 3.5%, whichever
is greater and (y)&nbsp;the weighted average of the book value of the net assets contributed by ACM to
our operating partnership per operating partnership unit, the offering price per share in the
private placement, the offering price per share of our common stock in subsequent offerings and the
issue price per operating partnership unit for subsequent contributions to our operating
partnership, multiplied by (2)&nbsp;the weighted average of our operating partnership&#146;s outstanding
units.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pro forma information does not reflect the results of the private placement. However,
gross proceeds from the private placement totaled $120.2&nbsp;million, which combined with ACM&#146;s equity
contribution of $43.9&nbsp;million, resulted in total contributed capital of $164.1&nbsp;million. Offering
expenses of $10.1&nbsp;million were paid or accrued by us, resulting in stockholders equity and minority
interest of $154.0&nbsp;million as a result of the private placement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro forma consolidated financial information is limited to adjustments that are directly
attributable to the private placement, expected to have a continuing impact on us and are factually
supportable. These adjustments are based on the assumption that certain compensation and benefits
expenses and certain selling and administrative expenses incurred by the structured finance
business of ACM would not have been incurred if we had been in operation during the periods
presented. The pro forma financial results do not include what the impact would have been had the
gross proceeds from the private placement been available to the structured finance business of ACM
during the entire period. Had these proceeds been available to the structured finance business of
ACM during the entire period, there would have been an impact on certain revenues and expenses,
including the management fees payable pursuant to the management agreement. The management fees are
calculated based on such factors as funds from operations and equity of our operating partnership,
each as defined in the management agreement. Such amounts represent speculative and forward-looking
information that is not factually supportable.

operations of the structured finance business segment of ACM and are not limited to the results of
the structured finance assets that were transferred to Arbor Realty Trust. Accordingly, the results
of certain investments in equity affiliates that were not transferred to Arbor Realty Trust have
been included in the financial statements of the structured finance business of ACM because they
were included in the structured finance business segment even though the operating results from
these equity affiliates have not been material to the structured finance business segment as a
whole. In addition, ACM retained certain transactions in its structured finance portfolio with a
net book value of approximately $27.8&nbsp;million, primarily because they

excluded from the financial statements of the structured finance business of ACM, additional
adjustments to the expense base would have been necessary to estimate what expenses would have been

operating results for assets that matured before the contribution of structured finance assets to
Arbor Realty Trust, but were in the portfolio of assets of the structured finance business of ACM

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Liquidity and Capital Resources</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liquidity is a measurement of the ability to meet potential cash requirements, including
ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain loans and investments and other general
business needs. On July&nbsp;1, 2003, ACM contributed a portfolio of structured finance investments and
related liabilities to our operating partnership. In addition, certain employees of ACM became our
employees. These assets, liabilities and employees represented a substantial portion of the
structured finance business of ACM.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003 we completed the private placement, resulting in gross proceeds of $120.2
million. Gross proceeds from the private placement combined with the concurrent equity contribution
by ACM totaled approximately $164.1 in equity capital.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to and as a result of the private placement, substantially all of the operations of
the structured finance business of ACM have been conducted by us. Therefore, a description of the
liquidity and capital resources of the structured finance business of ACM is not presented. A
description of our liquidity and capital resources is presented in the section of this report

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Related Party Loans</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACM has a 50% non-controlling interest in a joint venture, which was formed to acquire,
develop and/or sell real estate assets. At June&nbsp;30, 2003, December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001, ACM&#146;s
structured finance business&#146; investments in this joint venture were approximately $2.6&nbsp;million,
$2.3&nbsp;million and $1.8&nbsp;million, respectively. This investment is accounted for under the equity
method. At June&nbsp;30, 2003 and December&nbsp;31, 2002, ACM had a $16.0&nbsp;million bridge loan outstanding to
the joint venture, which is collateralized by a first lien position on a commercial real estate
property. There is a limited guarantee on the loan of 50% by the chief executive officer of ACM and
50% by the key principal of the joint venture. The loan requires monthly interest payments based on
one month LIBOR and matures in May&nbsp;2006. ACM agreed to provide the borrower with additional
mezzanine financing in the amount of up to $8.0&nbsp;million. The mezzanine financing requires interest
payments based on one month LIBOR and matures in May&nbsp;2006. The loan will be funded in two equal
installments of $4.0&nbsp;million. The funding will be drawn down as construction progresses. The
interest on the first component, which was funded by ACM in June&nbsp;2003, will be earned on the full
$4.0&nbsp;million, while the interest on the second component, which has yet to be funded, will be
earned as the $4.0&nbsp;million is drawn down. This additional financing is secured by a second mortgage
lien on the property. In addition, an interest and renovation reserve totaling $2.5&nbsp;million is in
place to cover both the bridge and mezzanine loans. Interest income recorded from these loans was
approximately $0.2&nbsp;million, $0.4&nbsp;million and $0.1&nbsp;million for the periods ended June&nbsp;30, 2003,
December&nbsp;31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2003, ACM invested approximately $0.8&nbsp;million in exchange for a 12.5% non-controlling
interest in a joint venture, which were formed to acquire, develop and/or sell real estate assets.
This investment is accounted for under the equity method. In June, 2003, ACM made two mezzanine
loans secured by a second lien position in the ownership interests of the borrower and the property

$8,000 for the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2003.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACM contributed the majority of its structured finance portfolio to our operating partnership
pursuant to a contribution agreement. The contribution agreement contains representations and
warranties concerning the ownership and terms of the structured finance assets it contributed and
other customary matters. ACM has agreed to indemnify us and our operating partnership against
breaches of those representations and warranties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange for ACM&#146;s asset contribution, we issued to ACM approximately 3.1&nbsp;million operating
partnership units, each of which ACM may redeem for one share of our common stock or an equivalent
amount in cash, at our election, and approximately 629,000 warrants, each of which entitles ACM to
purchase one additional operating partnership unit at an initial exercise price of $15.00. The
operating partnership units and warrants for additional operating partnership units issued to ACM
were valued at approximately $43.9&nbsp;million at July&nbsp;1, 2003, based on the price offered to investors
in our units in the private placement, adjusted for the initial purchaser&#146;s discount. We have also
granted ACM certain demand and other registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock
issuable upon redemption of its operating partnership units.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the approximately 3.1&nbsp;million operating partnership units received by ACM was paired
with one share of our special voting preferred stock that entitles the holder to one vote on all
matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As operating partnership units were redeemed for
shares of our common stock or cash an equivalent number of shares of special voting preferred stock
was redeemed and cancelled. As a result of ACM&#146;s asset contribution and the related formation
transactions, ACM owns approximately a 28% limited partnership interest in our operating
partnership and the remaining 72% interest in our operating partnership is owned by us. In
addition, ACM has approximately 28% of the voting power of our outstanding stock (without giving
effect to the exercise of ACM&#146;s warrants for additional operating partnership units).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We and our operating partnership have entered into a management agreement with ACM pursuant to
which ACM has agreed to provide us with structured finance investment opportunities and loan
servicing as well as other services necessary to operate our business. ACM is also required to
provide us with a right of first refusal with respect to all structured finance identified by ACM
or its affiliates. We have agreed not to pursue, and to allow ACM to pursue, any real estate
opportunities other than structured finance transactions. As discussed above in &#147;Management&#146;s
Discussion &#038; Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Arbor Realty Trust, Inc.
and Subsidiaries &#151; Contractual Commitments,&#148; we have agreed to pay our manager an annual base
management fee and incentive compensation each fiscal quarter and share with ACM a portion of the
origination fees that we receive on loans we originate with ACM pursuant to this agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We and our operating partnership have also entered into a services agreement with ACM pursuant
to which our asset management group provides asset management services to ACM. In the event the
services provided by our asset management group pursuant to the agreement exceed by more than 15%
per quarter the level of activity anticipated by our board of directors, we will negotiate in good
faith with our manager an adjustment to our manager&#146;s base management fee under the management
agreement, to reflect the scope of the services, the quantity of serviced assets or the time
required to be devoted to the services by our asset management group.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ITEM 7A. </B><B><I>QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and real estate values. The primary market risks
that we are exposed to are real estate risk, interest rate risk, market value risk and prepayment
risk.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Real Estate Risk</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial mortgage assets may be viewed as exposing an investor to greater risk of loss than
residential mortgage assets since such assets are typically secured by larger loans to fewer
obligors than residential mortgage assets. Multi-family and commercial property values and net
operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected
adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local
economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors),
local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing, retail, industrial, office or other
commercial space); changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction
quality, age and design; demographic factors; retroactive changes to building or similar codes; and
increases in operating expenses (such as energy costs). In the event net operating income
decreases, a borrower may have difficulty repaying our loans, which could result in losses to us.
In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential
proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans, which could also cause us to suffer losses.
Even when the net operating income is sufficient to cover the related property&#146;s debt service,
there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Interest Rate Risk</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and
tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors
beyond our control.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our
loans and our borrowing costs. Most of our loans and borrowings are variable-rate instruments,
based on LIBOR. The objective of this strategy is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes
on our net interest income. Many of our loans and borrowings are subject to various interest rate
floors. As a result, the impact of a change in interest rates may be different on our interest
income than it is on our interest expense. Based on the loans and liabilities as of December&nbsp;31,
2004, and assuming the balances of these loans and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent
twelve months, a 1% increase in LIBOR would increase our annual net income and cash flows by
approximately $2.3&nbsp;million because the principal amount of loans that would be subject to an
interest rate adjustment under this scenario is greater than the amount of liabilities that would
subject to an interest rate adjustment. A 1% decrease in LIBOR would decrease our annual net income
and cash flows by approximately $1.7&nbsp;million because the principal amount of loans exceeds the
amount of liabilities partially offset by the fact that the principal amount of loans currently
subject to interest rate floors (and, therefore, would not be subject to a downward interest rate
adjustment) exceeds the amount of liabilities currently subject to interest rate floors. As the
size of the portfolio increases, a decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net
income.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and/or economic downturn,
defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us, which could adversely affect our
liquidity and operating results. Further, such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse
effect on the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We invest in securities, which are designated as available-for-sale. These securities are
adjustable rate securities that have a fixed component for three years and, thereafter, generally
reset annually. These securities are financed with a repurchase agreement that bears interest at a
rate of one month LIBOR plus .15%. Since the repricing of the debt obligations occurs more quickly
than the repricing of the securities, on average our cost of borrowings will rise more quickly in
response to an increase in market interest rates than the earnings rate on the securities. This
will result in a reduction our net interest income

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">and cash flows related to these securities. Based on the securities and borrowings as of
December&nbsp;31, 2004, and assuming the balances of these securities and borrowings remain unchanged
for the subsequent twelve months, a 1% increase in LIBOR would reduce our annual net income and
cash flows by approximately $0.4&nbsp;million. A 1% decrease in LIBOR would increase our annual net
income and cash flows by approximately $0.4&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the CDO described in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations of Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries, the Company
entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to the risk of changes in the
difference between three-month LIBOR and one-month LIBOR interest rates. These interest rate swaps
became necessary due to the investor&#146;s return being paid based on a three-month LIBOR index while
the assets contributed to the CDO are yielding interest based on a one-month LIBOR index.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These swaps were executed on December&nbsp;21, 2004 with a notional amount of $469&nbsp;million and
expire in January&nbsp;2012. The market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing
market interest rates and swap spreads, which change over time. If
there were a 50&nbsp;basis point decrease in forward interest rates,
the value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by
approximately $21,000. If there were a 50 basis point increase in
forward interest rates, the value of these interest rate swaps would
have decreased by approximately $25,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks
such as counterparty credit risk, the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that
unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in
the contract. The counterparties to our derivative arrangements are major financial institutions
with high credit ratings with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial
relationships. As a result, we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet
their obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the
foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts
incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk. Derivatives are used for hedging
purposes rather than speculation. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.

however, given that these securities are guaranteed as to principal and/or interest by an agency of
the U.S. Government, such fluctuations are generally not based on the creditworthiness of the
mortgages securing these securities. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, the
estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing
interest rare environment, the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to
increase.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Prepayment Risk</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we receive repayments of principal on these securities, premiums paid on such securities
are amortized against interest income using the effective yield method through the expected
maturity dates of the securities. In general, an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the
amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the securities.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors and stockholders of<BR>
Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Arbor Realty
Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &#145;&#145;Company&#146;&#146;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders&#146; equity,
and cash flows for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 and for the period from
June&nbsp;24, 2003 (Inception) to December&nbsp;31, 2003. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item&nbsp;8. These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to
perform an audit of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.
An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as
a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Arbor Realty
Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December
31, 2004 and for the period from June&nbsp;24, 2003 (Inception) to
December&nbsp;31, 2003,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 1 &#151; Description of Business and Basis of Presentation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a Maryland corporation that was formed in June
2003 to invest in real estate related bridge and mezzanine loans, preferred equity and, in limited
cases, mortgage backed securities, discounted mortgage notes and other real estate related assets.
The Company has not invested in any discounted mortgage notes for the periods presented. The
Company conducts substantially all of its operations through its operating partnership, Arbor
Realty Limited Partnership (&#147;ARLP&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003 Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC (''ACM&#146;&#146;) contributed $213.1&nbsp;million of
structured finance assets and $169.2&nbsp;million of borrowings supported by $43.9&nbsp;million of equity in
exchange for a commensurate equity ownership in ARLP. In addition, certain employees of ACM were
transferred to ARLP. These assets, liabilities and employees represent a substantial portion of
ACM&#146;s structured finance business (the ''SF Business&#146;&#146;). The Company is externally managed and
advised by ACM and pays ACM a management fee in accordance with a management agreement. ACM also
sources originations, provides underwriting services and services all structured finance assets on
behalf of ARLP.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003 the Company completed a private equity offering of units, each consisting of
five shares of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Gross proceeds
from the private equity offering totaled $120.2&nbsp;million. Gross proceeds from the private equity
offering combined with the concurrent equity contribution by ACM totaled approximately $164.1
million in equity capital. The Company paid and accrued offering expenses of $10.1&nbsp;million
resulting in stockholders&#146; equity and minority interest of $154.0&nbsp;million as a result of the
private placement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;13, 2004 the Company sold 6,750,000 shares of its common stock in a public offering
at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $124.4&nbsp;million
after deducting the underwriting discount and the other estimated offering expenses. The Company
used the proceeds to pay down indebtedness. After giving effect to this offering, the Company had
14,949,567 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, on May&nbsp;6, 2004, the underwriters
exercised a portion of their over-allotment option, which resulted in the issuance of 524,200
additional shares on May&nbsp;11, 2004. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $9.8&nbsp;million
after deducting the underwriting discount. Additionally, in 2004, 2,401 shares of unvested
restricted stock were forfeited. On November&nbsp;3, 2004, ACM, the manager of our company elected to be
paid its third quarter incentive management in shares of common stock totaling 22,498.
Additionally, as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company issued 973,354 shares of common stock from the
exercise of warrants under its Warrant Agreement dated July&nbsp;1, 2003, the &#147;Warrant Agreement&#148;. After
giving effect to this, the Company had 16,467,218 shares issued and outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the
Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and partnerships or other joint ventures in which the
Company controls. Entities which we do not control and entities which are variable interest
entities (see Note 2), which we are not the primary beneficiaries, are accounted for under the
equity method. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ARBOR REALTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 2 &#151; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Use of Estimates</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions in
determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reclassifications</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered
to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents in high quality financial
institutions. The consolidated account balances at each institution periodically exceeds FDIC
insurance coverage and the Company believes that this risk is not significant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Loans and Investments</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;115 requires that at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to
maturity, available for sale, or trading depending on ability and intent. Securities held for sale
are reported at fair value, while securities and investments held to maturity are reported at
amortized cost. We do not have a trading security at this time. Loans held for investment are
intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan
origination costs and fees, unless such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company invests in preferred equity interests that, in some cases, allow the Company to
participate in a percentage of the underlying property&#146;s cash flows from operations and proceeds
from a sale or refinancing. At the inception of each such investment, management must determine
whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan, joint venture or as real estate. To
date, management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported
as loans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific valuation allowances are established for impaired loans based on the fair value of
collateral on an individual loan basis. The fair value of the collateral is determined by an
evaluation of operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period, and
estimated sales value computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net
operating income of the specific property, less selling costs, discounted at market discount rates.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, no impairment has been identified and no valuation allowances
have been established.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If upon completion of the valuation, the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the
impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan, an allowance is created with a
corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses. An allowance for each loan would be
maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 2 &#151; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Available-For-Sale Securities</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company invests in agency-sponsored whole pool mortgage related securities. Pools of
Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or
FHLMC, adjustable rate residential mortgage loans underlie these mortgage related securities. The
Company receives payments from the payments that are made on these underlying mortgage loans, which
have a fixed rate of interest for three years and adjust annually thereafter. These securities are
carried at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and
reported in other comprehensive income pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;115 &#147;Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities.&#148; Unrealized losses other than temporary losses are recognized
currently in income. The estimated fair value of these securities fluctuate primarily due to
changes in interest rates and other factors; however, given that these securities are guaranteed as
to principal and/or interest by an agency of the U.S. Government, such fluctuations are generally
not based on the creditworthiness of the mortgages securing these securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Interest income </I>&#151; Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned on loans,
investments and available-for-sale securities. In some instances, the Company receives an
additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed, an origination fee, and deferred
interest upon maturity. In some cases, interest income may also include the amortization or
accretion of premiums and discounts arising at the purchase or origination. This additional income,
net of any direct loan origination costs incurred, is deferred and accreted into interest income on
an effective yield or &#147;interest&#148; method adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the life of
the related loan or available-for-sale security as a yield adjustment. Income recognition is
suspended for loans when in the opinion of management a full recovery of income and principal
becomes doubtful. Income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and
performance is demonstrated to be resumed. Several of the loans provide for accrual of interest at
specified rates, which differ from current payment terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at
the accrual rate subject to management&#146;s determination that accrued interest and outstanding
principal are ultimately collectible, based on the underlying collateral and operations of the
borrower. If management cannot make this determination regarding collectibility, interest income is
recognized only upon actual receipt. Additionally, interest income is recorded when earned from
equity participation interests, referred to as equity kickers. These equity kickers have the
potential to generate additional revenues to the Company as a result of excess cash flows being
distributed and/or as appreciated properties are sold or refinanced.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Other income </I>&#151; Other income represents fees received for loan structuring and miscellaneous
asset management fees associated with the Company&#146;s loans and investments portfolio.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Gain on Sale of Loans and Real Estate</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sale of loans and real estate, recognition occurs when all the incidence of ownership
passes to the buyer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income from Equity Affiliates</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company invests in joint ventures that are formed to acquire, develop and/or sell real
estate assets. Such investments are recorded under the equity method. The Company records its share
of the net income from the underlying properties.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;130 &#147;Reporting comprehensive income&#148;, divides comprehensive income into net income
and other comprehensive income (loss), which includes unrealized gains and losses on available for
sale securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Income Taxes</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is organized and conducts its operations to qualify as a real estate investment
trust (&#147;REIT&#148;) and to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with respect thereto.
A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income
(&#147;Taxable Income&#148;) which is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of Taxable
Income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. Certain assets of the
Company that produce non-qualifying income may be held in taxable REIT subsidiaries. Unlike other
subsidiaries of a REIT, the income of a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to Federal and state
income taxes. As the taxable REIT subsidiaries of the Company have had minimal activity since their
inception, the Company has determined that no provision for income taxes is necessary at this time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Earnings Per Share</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting standards
No.&nbsp;128 (&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;128&#148;),
the Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share excludes
dilution and is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
exercised or converted into common stock, where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower
earnings per share amount.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Derivatives and Hedging Activities</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,&#148; as
amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;138, &#147;Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities.&#148; Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;133
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value. Additionally, the fair value
adjustments will affect either shareholders&#146; equity or net income depending on whether the
derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the
hedging activity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the normal course of business, we may use a variety of derivative financial instruments to
manage, or hedge, interest rate risk. These derivative financial instruments must be effective in
reducing its interest rate risk exposure in order to qualify for hedge accounting. When the terms
of an underlying transaction are modified, or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist, all
changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked-to-market with changes in value included in
net income for each period until the derivative instrument matures or is settled. Any derivative
instrument used for risk management that does not meet the hedging criteria is marked-to-market
with the changes in value included in net income.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 2 &#151; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation. We rely on quotations from
a third party to determine these fair values.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued FASB Interpretation
No.&nbsp;46, &#147;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities&#148; (&#147;FIN 46&#148;), which requires a variable
interest entity (&#147;VIE&#148;) to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary (&#147;PB&#148;). The PB is the party
that absorbs a majority of the VIE&#146;s anticipated losses and/or a majority of the expected returns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 (&#147;FIN 46(R)&#148;), delaying the effective date for
certain entities created before February&nbsp;1, 2003 and making other amendments to clarify the
application of the guidance. FIN 46(R) is effective no later than the end of the first interim or
annual period ending after December&nbsp;15, 2003 for entities created after January&nbsp;31, 2003 and for
entities created before February&nbsp;1, 2003, no later than the end of the first interim or annual
period ending after March&nbsp;15, 2004. As required, the Company adopted the guidance of FIN 46(R)
accordingly.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In adopting FIN 46 and FIN 46-R, the Company has evaluated its loans and investments and
investments in equity affiliates to determine whether they are VIE&#146;s. This evaluation resulted in
the Company determining that its mezzanine loans, preferred equity investments and investments in
equity affiliates were potential variable interests. For each of these investments, the Company has
evaluated (1)&nbsp;the sufficiency of the fair value of the entities&#146; equity investments at risk to
absorb losses, (2)&nbsp;that as a group the holders of the equity investments at risk have (a)&nbsp;the
direct or indirect ability through voting rights to make decisions about the entities&#146; significant
activities, (b)&nbsp;the obligation to absorb the expected
losses of the entity and their obligations are not protected directly or indirectly, (c)&nbsp;the right
to receive the expected residual return of the entity and their rights are not capped, (3)&nbsp;the
voting rights of these investors are proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected
losses of the entity, their rights to receive the expected returns of the equity, or both, and (4)
that substantially all of the entities&#146; activities do not involve or are not conducted on behalf of
an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company has
identified four loans and investments which were made to entities determined to be VIE&#146;s. The
following is a summary of the identified VIE&#146;s as of December, 31, 2004.

practice that existed relating to the accounting for loan commitments. SAB 105 is effective for
loan commitments entered into after March&nbsp;31, 2004. Our method of accounting for loan commitments
is consistent with the guidance provided by SAB 105.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 03-3, &#147;Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities
Acquired in a Transfer.&#148; SOP 03-3 addresses the accounting for acquired impaired loans, which are
loans that show evidence of having deteriorated in terms of credit quality since their origination.
SOP 03-3 is effective for loans acquired after December&nbsp;31, 2004. We do not expect the adoption of
SOP 03-3 to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued EITF 03-01, &#147;The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and
Its Application to Certain Investments.&#148; EITF 03-01 requires an investor to determine when an
investment is considered impaired, evaluate whether that impairment is other than temporary, and,
if the impairment is other than temporary, recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference
between the investment&#146;s cost and its fair value. The guidance also includes accounting
considerations subsequent to the recognition of an
other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have
not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The impairment loss recognition and
measurement guidance was to be applicable to other-than-temporary impairment evaluations in
reporting periods beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2004. In September&nbsp;2004, the FASB proposed additional
guidance related to debt securities that are impaired because of interest rate and/or sector spread
increases, and delayed the effective
date of EITF 03-01. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 03-01 to have a material effect on our
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. EITF 03-01 also includes disclosure
requirements for investments in an unrealized loss position for which other-than-temporary
impairments have not been recognized. These disclosures are included in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2004 as required by the EITF.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB published SFAS 123(R) entitled &#147;Share-Based Payment.&#148; It requires
all public companies to report share-based compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the
related share-based awards. We are required to adopt the provisions of the standard effective for
periods beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2005. We believe that our current method of accounting for
share-based payments is consistent with SFAS 123(R).

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 3 &#151; Loans and Investments (Continued)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridge loans are loans to borrowers who are typically seeking short term capital to be used in
an acquisition of property and are predominantly secured by first mortgage liens on the property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mezzanine loans are loans that are subordinate to a conventional first mortgage loan and
senior to the borrower&#146;s equity in a transaction. These loans may be in the form of a junior
participating interest in the senior debt. Mezzanine financing may take the form of loans secured
by pledges of ownership interests in entities that directly or indirectly control the real property
or subordinated loans secured by second mortgage liens on the property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A preferred equity investment is another form of financing in which preferred equity
investments in entities that directly or indirectly own real property are formed. In cases where
the terms of a first mortgage prohibit additional liens on the ownership entity, investments
structured as preferred equity in the entity owning the property serve as viable financing
substitutes. With preferred equity investments, the Company typically becomes a special limited
partner or member in the ownership entity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Concentration of Credit Risk</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans and investments that can potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk. The Company is subject to concentration risk in that, as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the unpaid
principal balance related to 16 loans with five unrelated borrowers represented approximately 38.1%
of total assets. The Company had 61 loans and investments as of December&nbsp;31, 2004. Also, no single
loan or investment represented at least 10% of the Company&#146;s total assets in 2004, and revenue from
any single borrower did not account for at least 10% of the Company&#146;s total revenues.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the unpaid principal balance related to ten loans with three
unrelated borrowers represented approximately 41% of total assets. The Company had 33 loans and
investments as of December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Company had a $35.0&nbsp;million loan which represents
approximately 10% of total assets, and two loans secured by one property totaling $45.0&nbsp;million
which represents approximately 13% of total assets. Summarized financial and other information
related to these transactions is described in footnote 5, &#147;Investment in equity affiliates&#148;.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Geographic Concentration Risk</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, 55%, 13%, 8% and 6% of the outstanding balance of the Company&#146;s loans
and investments portfolio had underlying properties in New York, Florida, New Jersey and Maryland,
respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, 32%, 14%, 12%, 8% and 8% of the outstanding balance of the
structured finance investments of the Company had underlying properties in New York, Maryland,
Florida, Nevada and New Jersey, respectively.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 6 &#151; Notes Payable and Repurchase Agreements (Continued)</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The $100&nbsp;million repurchase agreement with a expiration date of July&nbsp;2005, was entered into for the
purpose of financing our securities available for sale. The current borrowings equate to 96% of the
estimated fair value of the securities (net of principal payment receivables of $468,000) and bear
interest at a rate of one month LIBOR plus .15%. This agreement has a term of one year and will
expire in July&nbsp;2005.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $250&nbsp;million structured transaction facility contains profit-sharing arrangements between
the Company and the lender, which provide for profit sharing percentages ranging from 17.5% to
45.0% of net interest income of the loans and investments financed. This cost is included in
interest expense. On March&nbsp;28, 2005 we terminated this facility. See note 16 subsequent events.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warehouse credit agreement, the master repurchase agreements and the secured term credit
facility require that the Company pay down borrowings under these facilities pro-rata as principal
payments on our loans and investments are received.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the credit facilities contains various financial covenants and restrictions, including
minimum net worth and debt-to-equity ratios. The Company is in compliance with all financial
covenants and restrictions for the periods presented.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 7 &#151; Minority Interest</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003, ACM contributed $213.1&nbsp;million of structured finance assets and $169.2
million of borrowings supported by $43.9&nbsp;million of equity in exchange for a commensurate equity
ownership in ARLP, the Company&#146;s operating partnership. This transaction was accounted for as
minority interest and entitled ACM to a 28% interest in ARLP as of December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;13, 2004, the Company sold 6,750,000 shares of its common stock in an initial public
offering and a concurrent offering to one of the Company&#146;s directors. On May&nbsp;6, 2004, the
underwriters of the initial public offering exercised a portion of their over-allotment option,
which resulted in the issuance of 524,200 additional shares on May&nbsp;11, 2004. On October&nbsp;12, 2004
ACM exercised warrants for 629,345 operating partnership units which increased ACM&#146;s limited
partnership interest to 19%. Additionally, the Company issued 973,354 shares of common stock from
the exercise of warrants under the Warrant Agreement for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. These
transactions resulted in a 9% decrease in ACM&#146;s interest in ARLP. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, minority
interest was adjusted by $5.2&nbsp;million to properly reflect ACM&#146;s 19% limited partnership interest in
ARLP.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s charter provides for the issuance of up to 500&nbsp;million shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, and 100&nbsp;million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was incorporated in June&nbsp;2003 and was initially capitalized through the sale of 67
shares of common stock for $1,005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003 the Company completed a private placement for the sale of 1,610,000 units
(including an over-allotment option), each consisting of five shares of the Company&#146;s common stock
and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock, at $75.00 per unit, for proceeds of
approximately $110.1&nbsp;million, net of expenses. 8,050,000 shares of common stock were sold in the
offering. In addition, the Company issued 149,500 shares of stock under the stock incentive plan as
described below under &#147;Deferred Compensation&#148;.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;13, 2004, the Company sold 6,750,000 shares of its common stock in a public offering
at a price to the public of $20.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $125.4&nbsp;million
after deducting the underwriting discount and the other estimated offering expenses. The Company
used the proceeds to pay down indebtedness. After giving effect to this offering, the Company had
14,949,567 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, on May&nbsp;6, 2004, the underwriters
exercised a portion of their over-allotment option, which resulted in the issuance of 524,200
additional shares on May&nbsp;11, 2004. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $9.8&nbsp;million
after deducting the underwriting discount. In 2004, 2,401 shares of unvested restricted stock were
forfeited. In addition, on November&nbsp;2, 2004, ACM, the manager of our company elected to be paid its
third quarter incentive management in shares of common stock totaling 22,498. Moreover, for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company issued 973,354 shares of common stock from the exercise
of warrants under the Warrant Agreement and received net proceeds of $12.9&nbsp;million. After giving
effect to these transactions, the Company had 16,467,218 shares issued and outstanding.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a stock incentive plan, under which the board of directors has the authority
to issue shares of stock to certain directors, officers and employees of the Company and ACM. Under
the stock incentive plan, 185,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to
restricted stock awards. 147,500 restricted stock awards were made upon consummation of the private
placement of units on July&nbsp;1, 2003 and 2,000 restricted stock awards were made subsequently to
certain directors. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2004, 149,500 shares of restricted stock were
awarded and were outstanding. Of the shares awarded, two-thirds vested immediately and the
remaining one-third will vest ratably over three years on the anniversary date of the initial
award. Dividends were paid on the restricted shares as dividends were paid on shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock whether or not they are vested. For accounting purposes, the Company
measures the compensation costs for these shares as of the date of the grant, with subsequent
remeasurement for any unvested shares granted to non-employees of the Company with such amounts
expensed against earnings, at the grant date (for the portion that vest immediately) or ratably
over the respective vesting periods. The Company accounts for the stock incentive plan to employees
of the Company and employees of ACM under the fair value method. Fair value at the grant date was
$15.00 per share, which was based on the selling price of the common stock offered in our private
equity offering. For

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the private placement of units by the Company on July&nbsp;1, 2003, the Company
issued warrants to acquire 1,610,000 shares of common stock, as adjusted for dilution, at $15.00
per share. Concurrently, ACM was issued warrants to purchase 629,345 operating partnership units at
$15.00 per share. In July&nbsp;2004, these warrants became eligible for exercise through a cash payment
or by surrendering additional warrants or shares of common stock in a &#147;cashless&#148; transaction. These
warrants expire on July&nbsp;1, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, 1,321,975 common stock warrants were exercised for a
total amount of $12.9&nbsp;million and 973,354 common shares were issued. Of these totals, 115,176
common shares were issued from 463,797 warrants from a &#147;cashless&#148; exercise. As of December&nbsp;31,
2004, there were 288,025 common stock warrants outstanding. On October&nbsp;12, 2004, ACM exercised all
of its warrants for a total of 629,345 operating partnership units of ARLP and proceeds of $9.4
million. Subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2004 and as of February&nbsp;24, 2005, 38,558 common stock warrants
were exercised each for one share of equivalent common stock.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent with the formation of the Company, ACM contributed a portfolio of structured
finance investments and related debt to ARLP, the operating partnership of the Company, in exchange
for 3,146,724 units of limited partnership interest in ARLP and warrants to purchase an additional
629,345 operating partnership units. Concurrently, the Company, ARLP and ACM entered into a pairing
agreement. Pursuant to the pairing agreement, each operating partnership unit issued to ACM and
issuable to ACM upon exercise of its warrants for additional operating partnership units in
connection with the contribution of initial assets was paired with one share of the Company&#146;s special voting preferred
stock. The preferred stock was issued to ACM by the Company in exchange for a capital contribution
in the amount of $31,467. Each share of special voting preferred stock entitles the holder to one
vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company&#146;s stockholders. A holder of special voting
preferred stock will not be entitled to any regular or special dividend payments or other
distributions, other than a $0.01 per share liquidation preference. The Company has classified and
designated 5,000,000 shares of its
100,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock as special voting preferred stock. In 2004, ACM
exercised 629,345 warrants in exchange for operating partnership units resulting in the issuance of
629,345 shares of preferred stock.

average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the additional dilutive effect of common
stock equivalents during each period. The Company&#146;s common stock equivalents are its operating
partnership units, warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock and warrants to purchase
additional operating partnership units. The dilutive effect of the warrants is calculated using the
treasury stock method.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the exercise price of the warrants approximated the market value of the
common stock therefore, they were not considered to be dilutive for purposes of calculating diluted
earnings per share.

million. Based on the terms of the management agreement, ACM elected to be paid its incentive
management fee in common shares totaling 66,141, of which 43,643 were issued in 2005. These 43,643
shares were anti-dilutive and have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.

net earnings per share computations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 and for the period June

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 11 &#151; Related Party Transactions (Continued)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company had a $7.75&nbsp;million first mortgage loan as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, had a
$13.75&nbsp;million first mortgage loan and $1.2&nbsp;million second mortgage loan, which beared interest at
a variable rate of one month LIBOR plus 4.25% and matures in March&nbsp;2005, outstanding to a
not-for-profit corporation that holds and manages investment property from the endowment of a
private academic institution. Two of the Company&#146;s directors are members of the board of trustees
of the borrower and that institution. Interest income recorded from these loans for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $860,000 and $402,000, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACM has a 50% non-controlling interest in a joint venture, which was formed to acquire,
develop and/or sell real estate assets. At December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003, ACM&#146;s investment in this
joint venture was approximately $2.6&nbsp;million. All loans outstanding to this joint venture were
repaid in full in 2004. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, we had a $16.0&nbsp;million bridge loan outstanding to the
joint venture, which was collateralized by a first lien position on a commercial real estate
property. This loan was funded by ACM in June&nbsp;2003 and was purchased by us in July&nbsp;2003. The loan
required monthly interest payments based on one month LIBOR and was repaid in full in 2004. We had
agreed to provide the borrower with additional mezzanine financing in the amount of up to $8.0
million. The mezzanine financing required interest payments based on one month LIBOR and was repaid
in full in 2004. Interest income recorded from these loans for the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2004
and 2003 was approximately $848,000 and $486,000, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s $16.0&nbsp;million bridge loan to the joint venture was contributed by ACM as one of
the structured finance assets contributed to the Company on July&nbsp;1, 2003 at book value, which
approximates fair value. At the time of contribution, ACM also agreed to provide a limited
guarantee of the loan&#146;s principal amount based any profits realized on its retained 50% interest in
the joint venture with the borrower and ACM&#146;s participating interests in borrowers under three
other contributed structured finance assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of ACM&#146;s origination of three of the structured finance assets that it contributed
to us on July&nbsp;1, 2003 at book value, which approximates fair value, each of the property owners
related to these contributed assets granted ACM participating interests that share in a percentage
of the cash flows of the underlying properties. Upon contribution of the structured finance assets,
ACM retained these participating interests and its 50% non-controlling interest in the joint
venture to which it had made the $16.0&nbsp;million bridge loan. ACM agreed that if any portion of the
outstanding amount of any of these four contributed assets is not paid at its maturity or
repurchase date, ACM will pay to us, subject to the limitation described below, the portion of the
unpaid amount of the contributed asset up to the total amount then received by ACM due to the
realization of any profits on its retained interests associated with any other of the four
contributed assets (which had an aggregate balance of $48.3&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003).
However, ACM will no longer be obligated to make such payments to us when the remaining accumulated
principal amount of the four contributed assets, collectively, falls below $5&nbsp;million and none of
the four contributed assets were in default. In 2004, two of these investments matured and the
borrowers paid the amount due in full. The remaining two investments have an aggregate balance of
$22.3&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, approximately $0.3&nbsp;million of interest payments from
borrowers due from ACM were included in other assets. These payments were remitted in January&nbsp;2005.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, approximately $0.6&nbsp;million of interest reserve payments due to ACM were
included in other liabilities. These payments were remitted in January&nbsp;2005.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 11 &#151; Related Party Transactions (Continued)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2003, ACM received a brokerage fee for services rendered in arranging a loan facility for a
borrower. A portion of the loan facility was provided by the Company. The Company was credited
$146,918 of this brokerage fee which represented the Company&#146;s proportionate share of the loan
facility provided to the borrower and is included in other assets at December&nbsp;31, 2003, which was
received in January&nbsp;2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 12 &#151; Distributions</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to qualify as a REIT, the Company must currently distribute at least 90% of its
taxable income and must distribute 100% of its taxable income in order not to be subject to
corporate federal income taxes on retained income. The Company anticipates it will distribute all
of its taxable income to its stockholders. Because taxable income differs from cash flow from
operations due to non-cash revenues or expenses (such as depreciation), in certain circumstances,
the Company may generate operating cash flow in excess of its distributions or, alternatively, may
be required to borrow to make sufficient distribution payments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 the Company declared and paid distributions totaling
$15.6&nbsp;million, or $1.16 per share. For the period of June&nbsp;24, 2003 (inception)&nbsp;to December&nbsp;31,
2003, the Company declared and paid distributions totaling $4.1&nbsp;million, or $0.50 per share. For
tax purposes, 100% of dividends declared in 2004 are classified as ordinary income.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;13, 2005, the Company declared distributions of $0.47 per share of common stock,
payable with respect to the three months ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 to stockholders of record at the
close of business on January&nbsp;31, 2005. These distributions were subsequently paid on February&nbsp;15,
2005. Subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2004 and through the date of record, 38,558 common stock warrants
were exercised each for one share of equivalent common stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 13 &#151; Management Agreement</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and ARLP have entered into a management agreement with ACM which has an initial
term of two years with automatic one year extensions, subject to certain termination rights. After
the initial two year term, the Company will be able to terminate the management agreement without
cause for any reason upon six months&#146; prior written notice to ACM. If the Company terminates the
management agreement without cause, or gives ACM notice of non-renewal, in order to manage its
operations internally, the Company will be required to pay ACM a termination fee equal to the base
management fee and the incentive compensation earned by ACM during the 12-month period preceding
the termination. If, without cause, the Company terminates the management agreement or elects not
to renew it for any other reason, the Company will be required to pay ACM a termination fee equal
to two times the base management fee and the incentive compensation earned by ACM during the
12-month period preceding the termination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s chief executive officer is also ACM&#146;s chief executive officer and controlling
equity owner. ACM has agreed to provide the Company with structured finance investment
opportunities and loan servicing as well as other services necessary to operate its business. The
Company&#146;s chief executive officer, chief financial officer and general counsel and secretary are
not employees of the Company. The Company relies to a significant extent on the facilities and
resources of ACM to conduct its operations. The management agreement requires ACM to manage the
business affairs in conformity with the policies and the general investment guidelines that are
approved and monitored by the Company&#146;s board of directors. ACM&#146;s management of the Company is
under the direction or supervision of the Company&#146;s board of directors.

December&nbsp;31, 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 13 &#151; Management Agreement (Continued)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For performing services under the management agreement, the Company pays ACM an annual base
management fee payable monthly in cash as a percentage of ARLP&#146;s equity and equal to 0.75% per
annum of the equity up to $400&nbsp;million, 0.625% per annum of the equity from $400&nbsp;million to $800
million and 0.50% per annum of the equity in excess of $800&nbsp;million. For purposes of calculating
the base management fee, equity equals the month end value computed in accordance with GAAP of (1)
total partners&#146; equity in ARLP, plus or minus (2)&nbsp;any unrealized gains, losses or other items that
do not affect realized net income.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company also pays ACM incentive compensation each fiscal quarter, calculated as (1)&nbsp;25% of the
amount by which (a)&nbsp;ARLP&#146;s funds from operations per unit of partnership interest in ARLP, adjusted
for certain gains and losses, exceeds (b)&nbsp;the product of (x)&nbsp;9.5% per annum or the Ten Year U.S.
Treasury Rate plus 3.5%, whichever is greater, and (y)&nbsp;the weighted average of book value of the
net assets contributed by ACM to ARLP per ARLP partnership unit, the offering price per share of
the Company&#146;s common equity in the private offering on July&nbsp;1, 2003 and subsequent offerings and
the issue price per ARLP partnership unit for subsequent contributions to ARLP, multiplied by (2)
the weighted average of ARLP&#146;s outstanding partnership units. At least 25% of this incentive
compensation is paid to ACM in shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, subject to ownership
limitations in the Company&#146;s charter. With respect to all loans and investments originated during
the term of the management agreement, the Company has also agreed with ACM that the Company pays
ACM an amount equal to 100% of the origination fees paid by the borrower up to 1% of the loan&#146;s
principal amount.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incentive compensation is measured annually in arrears; provided, however, ACM shall
receive quarterly installments thereof in advance. The quarterly installments are calculated based
on the results for the period of twelve months ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter with
respect to which such installment is payable. Each quarterly installment payment is deemed to be an
advance of a portion of the incentive fee payable for the year. At least 25% of this incentive
compensation fee is paid to ACM in shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. For purposes of
determining the number of shares that are paid to ACM to satisfy the common stock portion of the
incentive management fee from and after the date the Company&#146;s common shares are publicly traded,
each common share shall have a value equal to the average closing price per common share based on
the last twenty days of the fiscal quarter with respect to which the incentive fee is being paid.
The incentive compensation fee is accrued as it is earned. In accordance with Issue 4(b) of EITF
96-18, ''Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring,
or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services,&#146;&#146; the expense incurred for incentive fee paid in
common stock is determined using the amount of stock calculated as noted above and the quoted
market price of the stock on the last day of each quarter. At December&nbsp;31, the Company remeasures
the incentive fee expense paid to ACM in shares of the company&#146;s common stock in accordance with
the guidance provided by Issue 4(a) of EITF 96-18, which discusses how to measure at the
measurement date when certain terms are not known prior to the measurement date. Accordingly,
expense recorded related to common stock issued as a portion of incentive fee was adjusted to
reflect the fair value of the stock on the measurement date when the final calculation of total
incentive fee was determined. In the event the calculated incentive compensation for the full year
is an amount less than the total of the installment payments made to ACM for the year, ACM will
refund to the Company the amount of such overpayment in cash regardless of whether such
installments were paid in cash or common stock. In such case, the Company would record a negative
incentive fee expense in the quarter when such overpayment is determined. In 2004, the full year
incentive fee was greater than the sum of the quarterly installments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACM is responsible for all costs incident to the performance of its duties under the
management agreement, including compensation of its employees, rent for facilities and other
''overhead&#146;&#146; expenses. The Company is required to pay or reimburse ACM for all expenses incurred on
behalf of the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the management agreement, ACM is also required to provide the Company with
a right of first refusal with respect to all structured finance transactions identified by ACM or
its affiliates. The Company has agreed not to pursue, and to allow ACM to pursue, any real estate
opportunities other than structured finance transactions. In addition, ACM&#146;s chief executive
officer, Ivan Kaufman, has entered into a non-competition agreement with the Company pursuant to
which he has agreed not to pursue structured finance investment opportunities, except as approved
by the board of directors of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, ACM earned incentive compensation installments totaling
$1,623,000, of which $499,000 was elected by ACM to be paid in 22,498 shares of common stock in
November&nbsp;2004. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, ACM&#146;s fourth quarter installment of $1,124,000 was included
in other liabilities. As provided for in the management agreement, ACM elected to receive this
entire incentive compensation fee in common stock. This fee was paid in February&nbsp;2005 in common
shares totaling 43,643. No incentive compensation was earned or paid in the period June&nbsp;24,
2003 (inception) to December&nbsp;31, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, ACM earned $1,992,000 in base management fees, of which
approximately $188,000 of fees were due to ACM for the month ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. They were
included in other liabilities and paid subsequently in January&nbsp;2005. In the period June&nbsp;24,
2003 (inception) to December&nbsp;31, 2003, ACM earned $588,000 in base management fees.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 14 &#151; Due to Borrowers</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to borrowers represents borrowers&#146; funds held by the Company to fund certain expenditures
or to be released at the Company&#146;s discretion upon the occurrence of certain pre-specified events,
and to serve as additional collateral for borrowers&#146; loans. While retained, these balances earn
interest on behalf of the borrower in accordance with the specific loan terms they are associated
with.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 15 &#151; Fair Value of Financial Instruments</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;107 requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of an entity&#146;s assets and
liabilities considered to be financial instruments. The following table summarizes the carrying
values and the estimated fair values of financial instruments as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003.
Fair value estimates are dependent upon subjective assumptions and involve significant
uncertainties resulting in variability in estimates with changes in assumptions.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2004</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 15 &#151; Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of
each class of financial instrument:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Loans and Investments, Net: </I></B>Fair values of variable-rate loans and investments
with no significant change in credit risk are based on carrying values. Fair
values of other loans and investments are estimated using discounted cash flow
methodology, using discount rates, which, in the opinion of management, best
reflect current market interest rates that would be offered for loans with
similar characteristics and credit quality.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Related Party Loans, Net: </I></B>Fair values of variable-rate loans and investments
with no significant change in credit risk are based on carrying values. Fair
values of other loans and investments are estimated using discounted cash flow
methodology, using discount rates, which, in the opinion of management, best
reflect current market interest rates that would be offered for loans with
similar characteristics and credit quality.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Notes Payable and Repurchase Agreements: </I></B>Fair values approximate the carrying
values reported in the balance sheets.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Available-for-Sale Securities: </I></B>Fair values are approximated on current market
quotes received from financial sources that trade such securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 16 &#151; Subsequent Events</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;19, 2005 the Company completed a non-recourse collateralized debt obligation
(&#147;CDO&#148;) transaction, whereby a portfolio of real estate related assets was contributed to a
consolidated subsidiary which issued $305&nbsp;million of investment grade-rated floating-rate notes in
a private placement. The subsidiary retained the equity interest in the issuer with a value of
approximately $164&nbsp;million. The notes are secured by a portfolio of real estate-related assets
with a face value of approximately $441&nbsp;million, consisting primarily of bridge loans, mezzanine
loans and junior participating interests in first mortgages, and by approximately $28&nbsp;million of
cash available for acquisitions of loans and other permitted investments. The notes have an
initial weighted average spread of approximately 77 basis points over three-month LIBOR. The
facility has a four-year replenishment period that allows the principal proceeds from repayments of
the collateral assets to be reinvested in qualifying replacement assets, subject to certain
conditions. The Company intends to own the portfolio of real estate-related assets until its
maturity and will account for this transaction on its balance sheet as a financing. In connection
with the CDO, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to
the risk of changes in the
difference between three-month LIBOR and one-month LIBOR. These interest rate swaps became
necessary due to the investor&#146;s return being paid based on a three-month LIBOR index while the
assets contributed to the CDO are yielding interest based on a one-month LIBOR index. These swaps
were executed on December&nbsp;21, 2004 with notional amounts of $469&nbsp;million and expire in January
2012. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the market value of these swaps was insignificant to the financial
statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;31, 2005 the Company entered into a $50&nbsp;million credit facility with a shareholder
who beneficially owned approximately 7.1% of our outstanding common stock as of December&nbsp;31, 2004.
The facility includes a $30&nbsp;million term loan, a $10&nbsp;million term loan and a $10&nbsp;million revolving
facility. The facility is secured by loans and investments in the Company&#146;s portfolio. The
facility has a term of one year with two six-month renewal options and bears interest at a spread
over LIBOR.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;15, 2005 the Company, through a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of its operating
partnership, issued $27.1&nbsp;million of junior subordinated notes in a private placement. These
securities are unsecured, have a maturity of 29&nbsp;years, pay interest quarterly at a floating rate of
interest based on LIBOR and, absent the occurrence of special events, are not redeemable during the
first five years.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
March&nbsp;29, 2005 we terminated the Company&#146;s $250&nbsp;million structured transaction facility
scheduled to expire in June&nbsp;2006. We simultaneously repaid all indebtedness outstanding on that
date. This debt underlying certain of our assets were transferred to our other facilities.

subsequent periods being retroactively reclassified to Interest Expense for the third and fourth
quarter&#146;s of 2004.

Commercial Mortgage, LLC

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of revenue and direct operating expenses of
the Structured Finance Business (the &#147;SF Business&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) of Arbor Commercial Mortgage,
LLC and Subsidiaries (&#147;ACM&#148;) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002. This financial statement is the
responsibility of ACM&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying financial statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for inclusion in the registration Statement
on form S-11 of Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. and do not purport to be a complete presentation of the
results of operations that would have resulted if the SF Business had operated as an unaffiliated
independent company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion the financial statement referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the revenue and direct operating expenses of the SF Business of ACM for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>THE STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS OF ARBOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, LLC<BR>
AND SUBSIDIARIES</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2002, and for the Six Months Ended June&nbsp;30, 2003</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 1 &#151; Description of Business and Basis of Presentation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003 Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC (&#145;&#145;ACM&#146;&#146;) contributed a portfolio of structured
finance investments and related debt to Arbor Realty Limited Partnership (&#145;&#145;ARLP&#146;&#146;), the operating
partnership of Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. (&#145;&#145;ART&#146;&#146;). In addition, certain employees of ACM were
transferred to ARLP. These assets, liabilities and employees represent a substantial portion of
ACM&#146;s structured finance business (&#145;&#145;SF Business&#146;&#146;) or (the &#145;&#145;Company&#146;&#146;). Through its SF Business,
ACM invests in real estate related bridge and mezzanine loans, preferred equity and other real
estate related assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Business of Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC is not a legal entity and the assets and
liabilities associated with the SF Business are components of a larger business. Accordingly, the
information included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements has been obtained from
ACM&#146;s consolidated historical accounting records. The SF Business never operated as a separate
business entity or division of ACM but rather as an integrated part of ACM&#146;s consolidated business.
Accordingly, the statements of revenue and direct operating expenses do not include charges from
ACM for corporate general and administrative expense because ACM considered such items to be
corporate expenses and did not allocate them to individual business units. Such expenses included
costs for ACM&#146;s executive management, corporate facilities and overhead costs, corporate accounting
and treasury functions, corporate legal matters and other similar costs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statements of revenue and direct operating expenses include the revenue and direct
operating expenses that relate to the SF Business. Direct operating expenses include interest
expense applicable to the funding costs of the SF Business loans and investments, salaries and
related fringe benefit costs, provision for loan losses and other expenses directly associated with
revenue-generating activities. Direct operating expenses also include allocations of certain
expenses, such as telephone, office equipment rental and maintenance, office supplies and
marketing, which were directly associated with the SF Business and were allocated based on
headcount of the SF Business in relation to the total headcount of ACM. All of these allocations
are based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of cash flows is not presented because the SF Business did not maintain a separate
cash balance. Other than the debt required to fund the loans and investments made by the SF
Business, its operating activities were funded by ACM. Because the SF Business never operated as a
separate business or division of ACM, the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not
intended to be a complete presentation of the historical financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the SF Business. The historical operating results of the SF Business may not be
indicative of the future operating results of ART. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements were prepared for inclusion in the Form S-11 of ART and do not purport to reflect the
assets and liabilities or results of operations that would have resulted if the SF Business had
operated as an unaffiliated independent company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of ACM, its wholly
owned subsidiaries, and partnerships or other joint ventures in which ACM holds, directly or
indirectly, over fifty percent of the outstanding voting shares. When partnership voting interest
are not clearly indicated, ACM reviews other factors to determine control, such as whether ACM is
entitled to over 50% of the profits and losses of the partnership. Additionally, for investments in
limited partnerships, ACM reviews the rights and obligations of the general partner and the limited
partners to determine if in substance the general partner controls such entity. These rights and
obligations include such items as whether the limited partner has the right to replace the general
partner, approve the sale or refinancing of the partnership assets or approve the acquisition of
additional significant partnership assets. In instances where AMC has a majority voting interest
but minority partners have significant participation, such as the right to establish operating and

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">capital decisions of the entity, ACM does not consolidate this entity. Based on this criteria,
investments in partnerships or joint ventures that ACM does not control are accounted for under the
equity method.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 2 &#151; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Use of Estimates</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Real Estate Owned</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real estate owned represents commercial real estate property acquired through foreclosure or
deed in lieu of foreclosure that the SF Business owns and operates. Such assets are classified as
held for sale and not depreciated. They are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to
sell. The Company reviews its real estate assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Loans and Investments</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at
cost, net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees, unless such loan or investment is deemed
to be impaired.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Business invests in preferred equity interests that allow the SF Business to
participate in a percentage of the underlying property&#146;s cash flows from operations and proceeds
from a sale or refinancing. At the inception of each such investment, management must determine
whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan, joint venture or as real estate. To
date, management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported
as loans.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific valuation allowances are established for impaired loans based on the fair value of
collateral on an individual loan basis. The fair value of the collateral is determined by an
evaluation of operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period, and
estimated sales value computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net
operating income of the specific property, less selling costs, discounted at market discount rates.
If upon completion of the valuation, the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the
impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan, an allowance is created with a
corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses. The allowance for each loan is maintained at
a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Revenue Recognition</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue recognition policies of the SF Business are as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Interest income </I></B>&#151; Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned. In most
instances, the borrower pays an origination fee, an additional amount of interest at the time the
loan is closed, and deferred interest upon maturity of the loan. This additional income, as well as
any direct loan origination

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">costs incurred, is deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as a yield adjustment.
Income recognition is suspended for loans when in the opinion of management a full recovery of
income and principal becomes doubtful. Income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes
contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed Several of the loans provide
for accrual of interest at specified rates, which differ from current payment terms. Interest is
recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management&#146;s determination that accrued
interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible, based on the underlying collateral
and operations of the borrower. If management cannot make this determination regarding
collectibility, interest income is recognized only upon actual receipt.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 2 &#151; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Other income </I></B>&#151; Other income includes several types of income which are recorded upon receipt.
Certain of the Company&#146;s loans and investments provide for additional payments based on the
borrower&#146;s operating cash flow, appreciation of the underlying collateral, payments calculated
based on the timing of when the loan pays off and changes in interest rates. Such amounts are not
readily determinable and are recorded as other income upon receipt.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Gain on Sale of Loans and Real Estate</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sale of loans and real estate, recognition occurs when all the incidence of ownership
passes to the buyer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Income from Equity Affiliates</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Business has several joint ventures that were formed to lend to, acquire, develop
and/or sell real estate assets. Such investments are recorded under the equity method. The Company
records its share of the net income from the underlying properties. The gain or loss on disposition
of a joint venture interest is recorded as gain on sale of loans and real estate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Income Taxes</I></B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No provision or benefit for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements due to the fact that the SF Business was not operated as a stand-alone unit
and no allocation of ACM&#146;s income tax provision/benefit has been made to the SF Business. ACM is a
limited liability company (which is taxed as a partnership), and accordingly, the taxable income or
loss of ACM is included in the federal and state income tax returns of ACM&#146;s individual members.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 3 &#151; Selected Cash Flow Information</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of cash flows is not presented because the SF Business did not maintain a separate
cash balance. Other than the debt required to fund the loans and investments of the SF Business,
operating activities were funded by ACM. Selected cash flow from investing and financing activities
is presented below.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 4 &#151; Loans and Investments</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bridge loan was foreclosed and reclassified as real estate owned in 2002. Prior to
foreclosure, the Company in 2002 recorded a provision for loan losses of $3,075,000 to reflect this
asset at its estimated fair value, excluding an estimated $300,000 of foreclosure cost. This amount
was charged-off when the loan was reclassified as real estate owned.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mezzanine loan was deemed to be impaired in 2002 and a $240,000 provision for loan losses
was recorded to reflect this loan at its estimated fair value in 2002 and $60,000 in the six months
ended June&nbsp;30, 2003. In accordance with the Company&#146;s policy for revenue recognition, income
recognition has been suspended on this loan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 5 &#151; Business Acquisitions and Investment in Equity Affiliates</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company had a 26% interest in a joint venture, which owns and operates a multi-family real
estate property. In March of 2002, the Company sold its investment in the joint venture and recorded a gain of $6.8
million. The Company received net income from this joint venture of $588,600 prior to the sale in
2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has several other joint ventures that were formed to acquire, develop and/or sell
real estate assets which the Company does not control. The Company recorded net income from these
joint ventures of $43,750 in 2002.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and
claims, the resolution of which, in management&#146;s opinion, will not have a material adverse effect
on the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 7 &#151; Related Party Transactions</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a 50% non-controlling interest in a joint venture, which was formed to
acquire, develop and/or sell real estate assets. At December&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company&#146;s investments in
this joint venture were approximately $2.3&nbsp;million. The Company accounts for this investment under
the equity method. At December&nbsp;31, 2002, the Company had a bridge loan outstanding to the joint
venture, which is collateralized by a first lien position on a commercial real estate property.
There is a limited guarantee on the loan of 50% by the chief executive officer of ACM and 50% by
the key principal of the joint venture. In connection with the joint venture agreement the Company
has agreed to provide the borrower with additional mezzanine financing. The loan will be funded in
two equal installments. The funding will be drawn down as construction progresses. This additional
financing is secured by a second mortgage lien on

year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2003, the Company invested approximately $818,000 in exchange for a 12.50% preferred
interest in a joint venture, which owns and operates two commercial properties. The Company
accounts for this investment under the equity method. In June&nbsp;2003, the Company funded two
mezzanine loans to this joint venture. Interest income recorded from these loans was approximately
$8,000 for the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 8 &#151; Subsequent Events</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2003 ART, a real estate investment trust was formed to invest in structured finance
assets, particularly real estate related bridge and mezzanine loans, preferred equity and, in
limited cases, discounted mortgage notes and other real estate related assets. On July&nbsp;1, 2003 in
exchange for a commensurate equity ownership in ART&#146;s operating subsidiary ARLP, ACM contributed
$213.1&nbsp;million of structured finance assets and $169.2&nbsp;million of borrowings supported by $43.9
million of equity. In addition, certain employees of ACM were transferred to ARLP. These assets,
liabilities and employees represent the substantial portion of ACM&#146;s SF Business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;1, 2003 ART completed a private placement of ART&#146;s units, each consisting of five
shares of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock. Gross proceeds from
the private financing combined with the concurrent equity contribution by ACM totaled approximately
$164&nbsp;million in equity capital. ART will be externally managed and advised by ACM and will pay ACM
a management fee in accordance with the management agreement. ACM will also originate, underwrite
and service all structured finance assets on behalf of ARLP.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 9 &#151; Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June, 2003 ACM formed ART, a newly organized real estate investment trust to operate and
expand its SF Business. On July&nbsp;1, 2003 ART completed a private placement of ART&#146;s units, each
consisting of five shares of ART&#146;s common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common
stock. Gross proceeds from the private financing totaled $120.2&nbsp;million. In exchange for a
commensurate equity ownership in ART&#146;s operating subsidiary, ARLP, ACM contributed $213.1&nbsp;million
of structured finance assets and $169.2&nbsp;million of borrowings supported by $43.9&nbsp;million of equity.
These assets and liabilities were contributed at book value, which approximates market value, and
represent 88% of the assets and 98% of the liabilities of the SF Business as of June&nbsp;30, 2003. In
addition, certain employees of ACM were transferred to ARLP.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ART will be externally managed and advised by ACM and will pay ACM a management fee in
accordance with the terms of the management agreement among ACM, ART and ARLP. ACM will also source
originations, provide underwriting services and service all structured finance assets on behalf of
ARLP. As a result, the operating expenses as presented in the historical consolidated financial
statements would have been affected had ART been formed at an earlier time. Employee compensation
and benefits expense would have decreased by $895,811 and $1,518,890 for the six months ended June
30, 2003 and year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002, respectively, because these costs would have been borne
by ACM under terms of the management agreement. Similarly, selling and administrative expense would
have decreased

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>THE STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS OF ARBOR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, LLC<BR>
AND SUBSIDIARIES</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<BR>
December&nbsp;31, 2002, and for the Six Months Ended June&nbsp;30, 2003</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Note 9 &#151; Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information (continued)</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">by $65,752 and $127,753 for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2003 and year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002,
respectively.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the terms of the management agreement, ACM will receive a management fee,
composed of a base management fee and incentive compensation. The annual base management fee is
payable monthly in cash as a percentage of ARLP&#146;s equity and equal to 0.75% per annum of the equity
up to $400&nbsp;million, 0.625% per annum of the equity from $400&nbsp;million to $800&nbsp;million and 0.50% per
annum of the equity in excess of $800&nbsp;million. For purposes of calculating the base management fee,
equity equals the month end value computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles of (1)&nbsp;total partners&#146; equity in ARLP, plus or minus (2)&nbsp;any unrealized gains, losses or other items
that do not affect realized net income.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ART will also pay ACM incentive compensation each fiscal quarter, calculated as (1)&nbsp;25% of the
amount by which (a)&nbsp;ARLP&#146;s funds from operations per unit of partnership interest in ARLP, adjusted
for certain gains and losses, exceeds (b)&nbsp;the product of (x)&nbsp;9.5% per annum or the 10&nbsp;year Treasury
Rate plus 3.5%, whichever is greater, and (y)&nbsp;the weighted average of book value of the net assets
contributed by ACM to ARLP per ARLP partnership unit, the offering price per share of ART&#146;s common
equity in the private offering on July&nbsp;1, 2003 and subsequent offerings and the issue price per
ARLP partnership unit for subsequent contributions to ARLP, multiplied by (2)&nbsp;the weighted average
of Arbor Realty Limited Partnership&#146;s outstanding partnership units. At least 25% of this incentive compensation is paid to
ACM in shares of ART&#146;s common stock, subject to ownership limitations in ART&#146;s charter. ART has
also agreed to share with ACM a portion of the origination fees that it receives on loans it
originates through ACM.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incentive compensation will be measured annually in arrears; provided, however, ACM shall
receive quarterly installments thereof in advance. The quarterly installments will be calculated
based on the results for the period of twelve months ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter
with respect to which such installment is payable. Each quarterly installment payment will be
deemed to be an advance of a portion of the incentive fee payable for the year. In the event the
calculated incentive compensation for the full year is an amount less that the total of the
installment payments made to ACM for the year, ACM will refund to ART the amount of such
overpayment in cash. In such case, ART would record a negative incentive fee expense in the quarter
when such overpayment is determined. The incentive compensation will be accrued as it is earned.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pro forma information does not reflect the results of the private financing. However,
gross proceeds from the private financing totaled $120.2&nbsp;million, which combined with ACM&#146;s equity
contribution of $43.9&nbsp;million, resulted in total contributed capital of $164.1&nbsp;million. Offering
expenses of $10.1&nbsp;million were paid by ART, resulting in stockholders equity and minority interest
of ART of $154.0&nbsp;million at its inception.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro forma consolidated financial information is limited to adjustments that are directly
attributable to the private placement, expected to have a continuing impact on ART and are
factually supportable. These adjustments are based on the assumption that certain compensation and
benefits expenses and certain selling and administrative expenses incurred by the SF Business would
not have been incurred if ART had been in operation during the periods presented. The pro forma
financial results do not include what the impact would have been had the gross proceeds from the
private financing been available to the Company during the entire period. Had these proceeds been
available to the Company during the entire period, there would have been an impact on certain
revenues and expenses, including the management fees payable pursuant to the management agreement.
The management fees are calculated based on such factors as funds

represent speculative and forward-looking information that is not factually supportable.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial statements of the SF Business include the results of operations of the
structured finance business segment of ACM and are not limited to the results of the structured
finance assets that were transferred to ART. Accordingly, the results of certain investments in
equity affiliates that were not transferred to ART have been included in the financial statements
of the SF Business because they were included in the structured finance business segment even
though the operating results from these equity affiliates have not been material to the structured
finance business segment as a whole. In addition, ACM retained certain transactions in its
structured finance portfolio with a net book value of approximately $27.8&nbsp;million, primarily
because they were not deemed to be suitable investments for ART. Had these retained
assets been excluded from the financial statements of the SF Business, additional adjustments to
the expense base would have been necessary to estimate what expenses would have been had these
assets not been in the portfolio. Such adjustments would have been speculative. Lastly, operating
results for assets that matured before the contribution of structured finance assets to ART, but
were in the portfolio of assets of the SF Business during the reporting period are also included in
these statements.
