</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
following is a summary of the previously reported governmental and internal
investigations regarding the Company and related matters. This summary updates the information
provided in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2004 (the
&#147;2004 Form 10-K&#148;) and in its Quarterly Reports for fiscal 2005. The 2004 Form 10-K reflected
certain conclusions reached by the Company&#146;s Audit Committee and
restated and reclassified the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters
of fiscal 2004. As discussed more fully below and as previously reported, settlement discussions
have recently commenced with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) regarding
resolution of its investigation with respect to the Company, and the Company has recorded a reserve
of $25&nbsp;million for fiscal 2005 in respect of the SEC investigation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously reported, in October&nbsp;2003, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry regarding the
Company. The SEC&#146;s initial request sought historical financial and related information including
but not limited to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. In
connection with the SEC&#146;s informal inquiry, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company commenced its own internal review in April&nbsp;2004, assisted by independent counsel. On May
6, 2004, the Company was notified that the SEC had converted the informal inquiry into a formal
investigation. On June&nbsp;21, 2004, as part of the SEC&#146;s formal investigation, the Company received
an additional SEC subpoena that included a request for the production of documents relating to
revenue classification, and the methods used for such classification, in the Company&#146;s
Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either &#147;Operating Revenue&#148; or &#147;Bulk Deliveries to Customer
Warehouses and Other.&#148; In addition, the Company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
District of New York had also commenced an inquiry with respect to the Company that the Company
understands relates to the revenue classification issue. On October&nbsp;12, 2004, in connection with
the SEC&#146;s formal investigation, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting the
production of documents relating to compensation information for specific current and former
employees and officers. The Company was notified in April&nbsp;2005 that certain current and former
employees and directors received subpoenas from the SEC requesting the production of documents.
The subject matter of these requests is consistent with the subject matter of the subpoenas the
Company had previously received from the SEC. The Company continues to respond to the SEC&#146;s
investigation and the Audit Committee&#146;s internal review and provide all information required.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During September and October&nbsp;2004, the Audit Committee reached certain conclusions with
respect to findings from its internal review. These conclusions regarding certain items that
impact revenue and earnings related to four primary areas of focus: (1)&nbsp;classification of sales to
customer warehouses between &#147;Operating Revenue&#148; and &#147;Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and
Other&#148; within the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment; (2)
disclosure of the Company&#146;s practice, in certain reporting periods, of accelerating its receipt and
recognition of cash discounts earned from suppliers for prompt payment; (3)&nbsp;timing of revenue
recognition within the Company&#146;s former Automation and Information Services segment; and (4)
certain balance sheet reserve and accrual adjustments that had been identified in the internal
review. These conclusions were detailed in Notes 1 and 2 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements&#148; included in the 2004 Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Audit Committee&#146;s conclusions with respect to findings from its
internal review, the Company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its
fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements, which were reflected in the
2004 Form 10-K. Revenue previously disclosed separately as &#147;Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses
and Others&#148; was aggregated with &#147;Operating Revenue&#148; resulting in combined &#147;Revenue&#148; being reported
in the financial statements. In addition, the Company changed its accounting method for
recognizing income from cash discounts. The Company also reduced its fourth quarter fiscal 2004
results of operations for premature revenue recognition within its former Automation and
Information Services segment after assessing the impact this segment&#146;s sales practice had on the
Company&#146;s results of operations for the three year period ended June&nbsp;30, 2004. Lastly, the Company
restated its consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and the first
three quarters of fiscal 2004 as a result of various misapplications of generally accepted
accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) and errors relating primarily to balance sheet reserve and accrual
adjustments recorded in prior periods. As a result, the Company supplemented its historical
disclosures within &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations&#148; in the 2004 Form 10-K to reflect these reclassification and restatement adjustments on
previously reported Company and business segment operating earnings performance. All prior period
disclosures presented in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations&#148; in the 2004 Form 10-K were adjusted to reflect these changes.
 More information with respect to the prior conclusions of the Audit
Committee&#146;s internal review and the impact of the reclassification
and restatement adjustments on the reporting periods discussed in
this Form 10-K is set forth in Notes 1 and 2 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the conclusions reached by the Audit Committee in September and October&nbsp;2004, the
Audit Committee began the task of assigning responsibility for the financial statement matters
described above which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K and in January&nbsp;2005 took disciplinary
actions with respect to the Company&#146;s employees who it determined bore responsibility for these
matters, other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for which there is a separate Board committee internal review (discussed below). The
disciplinary actions ranged from terminations or resignations of employment to required repayments
of some or all of fiscal 2003 bonuses from certain employees to letters of reprimand. These
disciplinary actions affected senior financial and managerial personnel, as well as other
personnel, at the corporate level and in the four business segments. None of the Company&#146;s current
corporate executive officers (who are identified under the heading &#147;Executive Officers of the
Company&#148; following Item&nbsp;4 of this Form 10-K) were the subject of disciplinary action by the Audit
Committee. In connection with the determinations made by the Audit Committee, the Company&#146;s
 former controller resigned effective February&nbsp;15, 2005. The Audit Committee has completed its
determinations of responsibility for the financial statement matters described above which were
reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K, although responsibility for matters relating to the Company&#146;s
accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers has been addressed by a
separate committee of the Board. The Audit Committee internal review is substantially complete.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the SEC&#146;s formal investigation, a committee of the Board of Directors, with
the assistance of independent counsel, separately initiated an internal review to assign
responsibility for matters relating to the Company&#146;s accounting treatment of certain recoveries
from vitamin manufacturers. In the 2004 Form 10-K, as part
of the Audit Committee&#146;s internal review, the Company reversed its previous recognition of
estimated recoveries from vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years and
recognized the income from such recoveries as a special item in the period in which cash was
received from the manufacturers. The SEC staff had previously advised the Company that, in its
view, the Company did not have an appropriate basis for recognizing the income in advance of
receiving the cash. In August&nbsp;2005, the separate Board committee reached certain conclusions with
respect to findings from its internal review and determined that no
additional disciplinary actions were required beyond the disciplinary
actions already taken by the Audit Committee, as described above. The separate Board committee internal review is substantially complete.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlement discussions have recently commenced with the SEC regarding resolution of
its investigation with respect to the Company. While these discussions are ongoing, there can be
no assurance that the Company&#146;s efforts to resolve the investigation with respect to the Company
will be successful, and the Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of these matters or the
terms of any such resolution. As a result of the initiation of these discussions, the Company
recorded a reserve of $25&nbsp;million for its fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2005 in respect of the SEC
investigation. Unless and until the SEC investigation is resolved, there can be no assurance that
the amount reserved by the Company for this investigation will be sufficient and that a

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">larger amount will not be required. Therefore, this reserve will be reviewed on a quarterly
basis and adjusted to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review and the
separate Board committee internal review remain ongoing, although the Audit Committee internal
review and the separate Board committee internal review are substantially complete. While the
Company is continuing in its efforts to respond to these inquiries and provide all information
required, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney
inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review or the separate Board committee internal review. The
outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry and any related legal and
administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or
criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former Company employees, officers

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s operations are organized into four reporting segments. They are Pharmaceutical
Distribution and Provider Services, Medical Products and Services, Pharmaceutical Technologies and
Services and Clinical Technologies and Services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through its Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment, the Company distributes
a broad line of pharmaceutical and other health care products. The Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical
Distribution business is one of the country&#146;s leading wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical and
related health care products to independent and chain drug stores, hospitals, alternate care
centers and the pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers located throughout the
United States. Through the acquisition of The Intercare Group, plc (which has been given the legal
designation of Cardinal Health U.K. 432 Limited and is referred to in this Form 10-K as
&#147;Intercare&#148;) in fiscal 2004, this segment also operates a distribution network within the United
Kingdom offering a specialized range of branded and generic pharmaceutical products. As a
full-service wholesale distributor, the Pharmaceutical Distribution business complements its
distribution activities by offering a broad range of support services to assist its customers and
suppliers in maintaining and improving the efficiency and quality of their services. These support
services include: online procurement, fulfillment and information provided through
cardinalhealth.com; computerized order entry and order confirmation systems; generic sourcing
programs; product movement and management reports; consultation on store operations and
merchandising; and customer training. The Company&#146;s proprietary software systems feature
customized databases specially designed to help its distribution customers order more efficiently,
contain costs and monitor their purchases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this segment, the Company also provides certain services to pharmaceutical
manufacturers in connection with new distribution service agreements entered into during fiscal
2005. In addition to the base distribution services, these services generally include inventory
management services, data/reporting services, new product launch support and deduction management
services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this segment, the Company also operates a pharmaceutical repackaging and distribution
program for independent and chain drug store customers as well as mail order customers. In
addition, through this segment the Company also is a franchisor of apothecary-style retail
pharmacies through its Medicine Shoppe International, Inc. (&#147;Medicine Shoppe&#148;) and Medicap
Pharmacies Incorporated (&#147;Medicap&#148;) franchise systems.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company made a business decision to exit its
branded pharmaceutical trading operations within this segment. These operations
represented less than 1% of the Company&#146;s fiscal 2005 Pharmaceutical Distribution revenue.

segment, the Company also distributes oncology, therapeutic plasma and other specialty
pharmaceutical and biotechnology products to hospitals, clinics and other managed-care facilities.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through its Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment, the Company provides a broad
range of technologies and services through facilities located in North America, Latin America,
Europe and Asia Pacific to the pharmaceutical, life sciences and consumer health industries. This
segment&#146;s Oral Technologies business provides proprietary drug delivery technologies, including

Inc., International Processing Corporation, American Threshold Industries, Inc., SP
Pharmaceuticals, L.L.C., Medicap, Snowden Pencer Holdings, Inc. and Geodax Technology, Inc
(&#147;Geodax&#148;). The Company has also completed the divestiture of certain operations of the medical

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to take
advantage of opportunities to expand its operations and services across all reporting segments from
time to time as appropriate. These acquisitions may involve the use of cash, stock or other

evaluates from time to time as appropriate its portfolio of businesses to identify any non-core
businesses for possible divestiture. For additional information concerning certain of the
transactions described above, see Notes 4, 17 and 22 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s largest customers, CVS Corporation (&#147;CVS&#148;) and Walgreen Co. (&#147;Walgreens&#148;),
accounted for approximately 21% and 10%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s revenue (by dollar volume)
for fiscal 2005. All of the Company&#146;s business with CVS and Walgreens is included in its
Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment. The aggregate of the Company&#146;s five
largest customers, including CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 37% of the Company&#146;s
revenue (by dollar volume) for fiscal 2005. The Company could be adversely affected if the
business of these customers was lost.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, certain of the Company&#146;s businesses have entered into agreements with group
purchasing organizations (&#147;GPOs&#148;) that act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on
behalf of their members. Approximately 15% of the Company&#146;s revenue for fiscal 2005 was derived
from GPO members through the contractual arrangements established with Novation, LLC (&#147;Novation&#148;)
and Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P. (&#147;Premier&#148;), the Company&#146;s two largest GPO relationships in
terms of member revenue. Generally, compliance by GPO members with GPO vendor selections is
voluntary. As such, the Company believes the loss of any of the Company&#146;s agreements with a GPO
would not mean the loss of sales to all members of the GPO, although the loss of such an agreement
could adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results. See Note 13 in &#147;Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements&#148; for further information regarding the Company&#146;s concentrations of credit risk
and major customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company obtains its products from many different suppliers, the largest of which, Pfizer
Inc., accounted for approximately 13% (by dollar volume) of the Company&#146;s revenue in fiscal 2005.
The Company&#146;s five largest suppliers combined accounted for approximately 42% (by dollar volume) of
the Company&#146;s revenue during fiscal 2005. Overall, the Company believes that its relationships
with its suppliers are good. New distribution service agreements recently entered into between the
Company and certain branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally range from a one-year term with
an automatic renewal feature to a five-year term. Such agreements generally cannot be terminated
unless mutually agreed to by the parties, a breach of the agreement occurs that is not cured, or in
the event of an involuntary bankruptcy filing. The loss of certain suppliers could adversely
affect the Company&#146;s business if alternative sources of supply were unavailable at reasonable
rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution business is in a business model transition with
respect to how it is compensated for the logistical, capital and administrative services that it
provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Historically, the compensation received by the
Pharmaceutical Distribution business from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers was based on each
manufacturer&#146;s unique sales practices (e.g., volume of product available for sale, eligibility to
purchase product, cash discounts for prompt payment, rebates, etc.) and pharmaceutical pricing
practices (e.g., the timing, frequency and magnitude of product price increases). Specifically, a
significant portion of the compensation the Pharmaceutical Distribution business received from
manufacturers was derived from the Company&#146;s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in
advance of pharmaceutical price increases, hold that inventory as manufacturers increased
pharmaceutical prices, and generate a higher operating margin on the subsequent sale of that
inventory. This compensation system was dependent to a large degree upon the sales practices of
each branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, including established policies concerning the volume of
product available for purchase in advance of a price increase, and on predictable pharmaceutical
pricing practices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in fiscal 2003, branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control
over the amount of pharmaceutical product available in the supply chain, and, as a result, began to
change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by
pharmaceutical wholesalers. In addition, manufacturers have increasingly sought more services from
the Company, including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns. The
Company believes that the manufacturers sought these changes to provide them with greater
visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and
integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to, and distributed in, the
secondary market. These changes have significantly reduced the compensation received by the
Company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. As a result of these actions by branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Company concluded it was no longer being adequately and
consistently compensated for the reliable and consistent logistical, capital and administrative
services being provided by the Company to these manufacturers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the developments discussed above, the Company has established a compensation
system that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers&#146; sales or pricing practices, and is
based on the services provided by the Company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each
manufacturer&#146;s products. During fiscal 2005, the Company worked with individual branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee-for-service terms that adequately compensate the Company
based on the services being provided to such manufacturers. The initial fee-for-service transition
is essentially complete, which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the transition to fee-for-service terms, certain of the new distribution service
agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an
inflation-based compensation component to them. Arrangements with certain
other branded manufacturers still continue to be solely inflation-based. If branded
pharmaceutical price inflation is lower than the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Company has anticipated, its operating results
could be adversely affected with respect to its current exposure to contingent fee-based
compensation in its Pharmaceutical Distribution business.
 In addition, certain key distribution service agreements will be re-negotiated in the latter
half of fiscal 2006 and into fiscal 2007 when their initial terms expire. If the terms of the
re-negotiated agreements are unfavorable to the Company, it could adversely affect the Company&#146;s
operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s manufacturing businesses within the Medical Products and Services and
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segments use a broad range of raw materials in the
products that they produce. These raw materials include for Medical Products and Services, latex,
resin and fuel oil and, for Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services, resin, gelatin and active
pharmaceutical ingredients, among others. In certain circumstances, the Company&#146;s operating
results may be adversely affected by increases in raw materials costs because the Company may not
be able to fully recover the increased costs from the customer or offset the increased cost through
productivity improvements. In addition, although most of these raw materials are generally
available, certain raw materials used by the Company&#146;s manufacturing businesses may be available
only from a limited number of suppliers. There also may be cases where a particular raw material
may be available from another supplier or several other suppliers, but the Company is constrained
to use a particular supplier due to customer requirements, regulatory filings or product approvals.
In either case, where there are a limited number of suppliers, the Company may experience
shortages in supply, and as a result, the Company&#146;s operating results could be adversely affected.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution business utilizes contract carriers to distribute
its products. Contracts with these carriers generally contain a fuel surcharge capped at a certain
percentage. If fuel costs rise significantly, the Pharmaceutical Distribution business may need to
increase the specified fuel surcharge, which is limited to specified
annual percentage increases, with certain contract carriers. In the event that the
Pharmaceutical Distribution business cannot reach agreement on these changes, it may need to replace
the contract carriers at prevailing market rates. The Company&#146;s Medical Products and Services
Distribution and Nuclear Pharmacy Services businesses own their distribution fleets, which
distribute a majority of their products to customers. These businesses are directly impacted by
market changes in the price of fuel. As a result of the Company&#146;s exposure to fuel costs, the
Company&#146;s operating results may be adversely affected by
increased fuel costs, as the Company
may not be able to fully recover the increased costs from its customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Medical Products and Services Distribution business purchases medical/surgical
products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products. Certain manufacturers
have adopted policies limiting the ability of such business to purchase products from anyone other
than the manufacturer. If this practice becomes more widespread, the ability of the Medical
Products and Services Distribution business to purchase products from other distributors, as well
as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors, may be impaired. This could
adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While certain of the Company&#146;s operations may show quarterly fluctuations, the Company does
not consider its business to be seasonal in nature on a consolidated basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The markets in which the Company operates generally are highly competitive.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment, the Company&#146;s pharmaceutical
wholesale distribution business competes directly with two other national wholesale distributors
(McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) and a number of smaller regional wholesale
distributors, direct selling manufacturers, self-warehousing chains, specialty distributors and
third-party logistics companies on the basis of a value proposition that includes breadth of
product lines, service offerings, support services and pricing. The Company&#146;s pharmaceutical
wholesale distribution operations have narrow profit margins and, accordingly, the Company&#146;s
earnings depend significantly on its ability to distribute a large volume and variety of products
efficiently, to provide quality support services, to compete effectively on the pricing of
pharmaceutical products, and to maintain satisfactory arrangements with pharmaceutical
manufacturers whereby the Company is compensated for its logistical, capital and administrative
services. With respect to pharmacy franchising operations, a few smaller franchisors compete with
Medicine Shoppe and Medicap in the franchising of pharmacies, with competition being based
primarily upon benefits offered to both the pharmacist and the customer, access to third-party
programs, the reputation of the franchise and pricing. Medicine Shoppe and Medicap also need to be
competitive with a pharmacist&#146;s ongoing options to operate or work for an independent or chain
pharmacy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Medical Products and Services segment competes both domestically and
internationally. Competitive factors within medical-surgical supply distribution include price,
breadth of product offerings, product availability, order-filling accuracy (both invoicing and
product selection) and service offerings. Within its distribution services, this segment competes
across several
customer classes with many different distributors, including Owens &#038; Minor, Inc., Fisher
Scientific International, Inc., and Henry

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Schein, Inc., among others. Competitive factors within
medical-surgical product manufacturing include brand recognition and product innovation,
performance, quality and price. This segment competes against many product manufacturers, some of
which are larger and more diversified than Medical Products and Services. The Company believes
that its key competitive strengths within this segment include its ability to work with customers
to help them provide quality care while enhancing their competitiveness through cost-savings
initiatives. This competitive strength is enhanced through the integration of products and
services within both the Medical Products and Services segment and across other Company segments.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment, the Company competes on several
fronts both domestically and internationally, including competing with other companies that provide
outsourcing services to pharmaceutical manufacturers based in North America, Latin America, Europe
and Asia Pacific and competing with those pharmaceutical manufacturers that choose to perform these
services themselves. Specifically, in this segment, the Company competes with providers of both
new drug delivery technologies and existing delivery technologies as well as oral solid dose
manufacturing; with other providers of sterile fill/finish manufacturing and lyophilization
services; with providers of contract discovery, development, analytical laboratory and regulatory
consulting services and manufacturing and packaging of clinical supplies; with companies that
provide packaging components and packaging services; with other providers of medical education,
marketing/product launch services, contract sales and product logistics services; and with other
nuclear pharmacy companies and distributors engaged in the preparation and delivery of
radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging procedures in hospitals and clinics, which include
numerous operators of radiopharmacies, numerous independent radiopharmacies and manufacturers and
universities that have established their own radiopharmacies. The Company competes in this segment
based upon a variety of factors, principally including quality, responsiveness, proprietary
technologies or capabilities, customer service and price.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Clinical Technologies and Services segment, the Alaris products business competes based
upon quality, technological innovation, the value proposition of helping improve patient outcomes
while reducing overall costs associated with medication safety, and price. Alaris&#146; competitors
include both domestic and foreign companies, including Baxter International, Inc., Hospira, Inc.
and B. Braun Medical, Inc. The Pyxis products business competes based upon quality, relationships
with customers, customer service and support capabilities, patents and other intellectual property,
its ability to interface with customer information systems, and price. Actual and potential
competitors for Pyxis include both existing domestic and foreign companies, as well as emerging
companies that supply products for specialized markets and other outside service providers. Such
competitors include McKesson Corporation and Omnicell, Inc. With respect to services that enhance
performance in hospital pharmacies, the Company competes with both national and regional hospital
pharmacy management firms, and self-managed hospitals and hospital systems on the basis of services
offered, its established base of existing operations, the effective use of information systems, the
development of clinical programs, the quality of the services it provides to its customers and
price.

of September&nbsp;9, 2005, the Company had more than 55,000 employees in the U.S. and abroad,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company relies on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws,
nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its products,
services and intangible assets. These proprietary rights are important to the Company&#146;s ongoing
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has applied in the United States and certain foreign countries for registration of
a number of trademarks and service marks, some of which have been registered, and also holds common
law rights in various trademarks and service marks. It is possible that in some cases the Company
may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks and service marks for which it has
applied.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company holds patents relating to certain aspects of its automated pharmaceutical
dispensing systems, automated medication management systems, medication packaging, medical devices,
processes, products, formulations, infusion therapy systems, infusion administration sets, drug
delivery systems and sterile manufacturing. The Company has a number of pending patent
applications in the United States and certain foreign countries, and intends to pursue additional
patents as appropriate. The Company has enforced and will continue to enforce its intellectual
property rights in the United States and worldwide.

Controlled Substances Act and the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and similar state laws,
which regulate the marketing, purchase, storage and distribution of prescription drugs and
prescription drug samples under prescribed minimum standards. Certain of the Company&#146;s
subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act, as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, the Safe Medical Device Act of
1990, as amended in 1992, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, and comparable
foreign regulations. In addition, certain of the Clinical Technologies and Services segment&#146;s
Alaris products are indirectly subject to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act.

Federal Trade Commission regulations, and rules and regulations adopted by certain states, which
require franchisors to make certain disclosures to prospective franchisees prior to the sale of

care information gathered and assessed for the benefit of health care clients. Greater scrutiny on
a federal and state level is being placed on how patient identifiable health care information
should be handled and in identifying the appropriate parties and means to do so. Future changes in
regulations and/or legislation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 (&#147;HIPAA&#148;) and its accompanying federal regulations, such as those pertaining to privacy and
security, may affect how some of these information services or products are provided. In addition,
certain of the Company&#146;s operations, depending upon their location, may be subject to additional
state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and how information services or
products are provided. Failure to comply with HIPAA and other such laws may subject the Company
and/or its subsidiaries to civil and/or criminal penalties, which could be significant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and
recommendations, both in the United States and abroad, relating to safe working conditions,
laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or
potentially hazardous substances. The Company&#146;s environmental policies mandate compliance with all
applicable regulatory requirements concerning environmental quality and contemplate, among other
things, appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection for each of its subsidiaries.
In addition, U.S. and international import and export laws and regulations require that the
Company abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of finished goods,
raw materials and supplies and the handling of information. The Company is also subject to certain
laws and regulations concerning the conduct of its foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of the Company&#146;s
internal books and records.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state pharmacy
boards and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to
prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical
distribution system. Certain states, such as Florida and California, have already adopted laws and
regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system
while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations. These laws and
regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the Company&#146;s
Pharmaceutical Distribution business, and may adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results.
The Company continues to work with its suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with
counterfeit products in the supply chain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs associated with complying with the various applicable federal regulations, as well
as state and foreign regulations, could be significant and the failure to comply with all such
legal requirements could have an adverse affect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and
financial condition.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has historically maintained higher levels of inventory in its Pharmaceutical
Distribution business in order to satisfy daily delivery requirements and take advantage of
price changes as partial compensation for its services, but is not generally required by its
customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as may be required to meet service
level requirements. In connection with the business model transition discussed under
&#147;Customers and Suppliers&#148; above, the Pharmaceutical Distribution business&#146; inventory levels are
significantly lower than historical levels. This trend, primarily attributable to reduced
pharmaceutical investment buying opportunities and lower inventory levels negotiated with
pharmaceutical manufacturers, is expected to continue. Certain supply contracts with U.S.
Government entities require the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution and Medical Products
Distribution businesses to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands. The
Company does not believe that the requirements contained in these U.S. Government supply
contracts materially impact inventory levels. The Company&#146;s customer return policy requires
that the product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees, and only allows customers
to return products which can be added back to inventory and resold at full value, or which can
be returned to vendors for credit. The Company&#146;s practice is to offer market payment terms to
its customers. The Company is not aware of any material differences between its practices and
those of other industry participants.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not possible to predict all risks that may affect future results, these risks
may include, but are not limited to, the following:
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Intense competition may erode the Company&#146;s profit margins. </B>The markets in which the
Company operates generally are
highly competitive. For example, in its Pharmaceutical Distribution business, the Company competes
with national wholesale distributors McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and a
number of smaller regional wholesale distributors, direct selling manufacturers, self-warehousing
chains, specialty distributors and third-party logistics companies. Competitive pressures across
business segments have contributed to a decline in the Company&#146;s gross profit margins on revenue
from approximately 4% in fiscal 2002 to 3% in fiscal 2005. This trend may continue and the
Company&#146;s business could be adversely affected as a result.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution business is transitioning its business model, which
subjects the Company to risks and uncertainties. </B>As discussed more fully under &#147;Customers and
Suppliers&#148; within &#147;Item&nbsp;1: Business,&#148; the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution business, which is
the Company&#146;s largest business, is in a business model transition with respect to how it is
compensated for the logistical, capital and administrative services it provides to branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers. During fiscal 2005, the Company worked with individual branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee-for-service terms that adequately compensate the Company
based on the services being provided to such manufacturers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the transition to fee-for-service terms, certain of the new distribution service
agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an
inflation-based compensation component to them. Arrangements with certain other branded
manufacturers still continue to be solely inflation-based. If branded pharmaceutical price
inflation is lower than the Company has anticipated, its operating results could be adversely
affected with respect to its current exposure to contingent fee-based compensation in its
Pharmaceutical Distribution business.
 In addition, certain key distribution service agreements will be re-negotiated in the latter
half of fiscal 2006 and into fiscal 2007 when their initial terms expire. If the terms of the
re-negotiated agreements are unfavorable to the Company, it could adversely affect the Company&#146;s
operating results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The ongoing SEC investigation and U.S. Attorney inquiry could adversely affect the Company&#146;s
business, financial condition or operating results. </B>As discussed below under &#147;Item&nbsp;3: Legal
Proceedings&#148; and Note 1 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,&#148; the Company is the subject
of a formal SEC investigation and had learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of
New York had also commenced an inquiry with respect to the Company. In April&nbsp;2004, the Company&#146;s
Audit Committee commenced its own internal review, assisted by independent counsel. While the
Company is continuing in its efforts to respond to these inquiries
 and provide all information required, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the
SEC investigation or the U.S. Attorney inquiry. There can be no assurance that the scope of the
SEC investigation or the U.S. Attorney inquiry will not expand or that other regulatory agencies
will not become involved. The outcome of, and costs associated with, the SEC investigation and the
U.S. Attorney inquiry could adversely affect the Company&#146;s business, financial condition or
operating results, and the investigations could divert the efforts and attention of its management
team from the Company&#146;s ordinary business operations. The outcome of the SEC investigation, the
U.S. Attorney inquiry and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the
institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company
and/or current or former Company employees, officers and/or directors, as well as the imposition of
fines and other penalties, remedies and sanctions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Additional restatements may be required, the historical consolidated financial statements may
change or require amendment or additional disciplinary actions may be required; the Audit Committee
may identify new issues, or make additional findings if it receives additional information, that
may have an impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and the scope of the restatements
described in Forms 10-K and 10-Q. </B>During September and October&nbsp;2004, the Audit Committee reached

in Notes 1 and 2 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; included in the 2004 Form 10-K.
In connection with these conclusions, the Audit Committee previously determined that the
consolidated financial statements of the Company with respect to fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
as well as the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, should be restated to reflect the conclusions
from its internal review to date. In January&nbsp;2005, the Audit Committee took disciplinary actions
with respect to the Company&#146;s employees who it determined bore responsibility for these matters,
other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for which there is a separate Board committee internal review.
There can be no assurance that additional restatements will not be required, that
the historical consolidated financial statements included in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for
the quarterly periods during fiscal 2005, or this Form 10-K will not change or require amendment,

its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as
of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and based on that assessment, concluded that
the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of June 30, 2005. The Company&#146;s auditor, Ernst &#038; Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on
management&#146;s assessment that expresses unqualified opinions on management&#146;s assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Still, however, the
Company&#146;s growth continues to place stress on its internal controls, and there can be no assurance
that the Company&#146;s control procedures will continue to be adequate. The effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s controls and procedures may be limited by a variety of
risks, including, among other things, faulty human
judgment, simple errors, omissions and mistakes, collusion of two or more people or inappropriate
management override of procedures. If the Company fails to have effective internal controls and
procedures for financial reporting in place, it could be unable to provide timely and reliable
financial information.

products from vendors other than the original manufacturer of such products. Certain manufacturers
have adopted policies limiting the ability of such business to purchase products from anyone other
than the manufacturer. If this practice becomes more widespread, the ability of the Medical
Products and Services Distribution business to purchase products from other distributors, as well
as its ability to sell excess inventories to other distributors, may be impaired. This could
adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare and public policy trends indicate that the number of generic drugs will increase
over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug

the Company was anticipating, this could adversely affect the
Company&#146;s net earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been increasing efforts by various levels of government including state pharmacy
boards and comparable agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to
prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical
distribution system. Certain states, such as Florida and California, have already adopted laws and
regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the pharmaceutical distribution system
while other government agencies are currently evaluating their recommendations. These laws and
regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with the Company&#146;s
Pharmaceutical Distribution business, and may adversely affect the Company&#146;s business, financial
condition or operating results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been increasing efforts by various parties to introduce and pass legislation that

laws and regulations on fraud and abuse. Many of the regulations applicable to the Company,
including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical or medical-surgical
suppliers, are vague and could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial
authority in a manner that could require the Company to make changes in its operations. If the
Company fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could suffer civil and criminal
penalties, including the loss of licenses or its ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and
other federal and state healthcare programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the &#147;Act&#148;),
the U.S. government recently proposed changes in certain pharmaceutical reimbursement rates. The
Company may be adversely affected by changes or changes that may be proposed in the future under
the Act. The Company is in the process of developing plans to mitigate any exposures from these
changes in reimbursement rates and the way its customers conduct their business under the Act.
However, if the Company fails to successfully implement such plans, its business and the results of
operations may be adversely affected.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The outcomes of lawsuits brought against the Company may adversely affect the Company&#146;s business,
financial condition or operating results. </B>As discussed below under &#147;Item&nbsp;3: Legal
Proceedings,&#148; the Company is subject to numerous lawsuits, including several class action lawsuits
against the Company and certain of its former and present officers and directors. Any settlement
of or judgment in one or more of these matters could adversely affect the Company&#146;s business,
financial condition or operating results. There can be no assurance that all or any portion of the
liability arising from these pending lawsuits will be covered by insurance policies that the
Company currently maintains.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The Company could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more significant customers or group
of customers, or by a change in customer mix. </B>The Company&#146;s largest customers, CVS and
Walgreens, accounted for approximately 21% and 10%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s revenue (by
dollar volume) for fiscal 2005. The aggregate of the Company&#146;s five largest customers, including
CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately 37% of the Company&#146;s revenue (by dollar volume) for
fiscal 2005. The Company&#146;s business and operating results could be adversely affected if the
business of these customers was lost.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, certain of the Company&#146;s businesses have entered into agreements with GPOs.
Approximately 15% of the Company&#146;s revenue for fiscal 2005 was derived from GPO members through the
contractual arrangements established with Novation and Premier. Generally, compliance by GPO
members with GPO vendor selections is voluntary. Notwithstanding this fact, the loss of such an
agreement could adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results. See the &#147;Customers and
Suppliers&#148; discussion within &#147;Item&nbsp;1: Business&#148; and Note 13 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements&#148; for further information regarding the Company&#146;s significant customers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the Company&#146;s customer mix could also significantly impact its business, financial
condition or operating results. Due to the diverse range of health care supply management and
health care information technology products and services that the Company offers, such changes may
adversely affect certain of the Company&#146;s businesses, while not affecting some of its competitors
who offer a narrower range of products and services.

As discussed more fully in the &#147;Overview&#148; section within
&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations,&#148; in fiscal 2005, the Company launched a global restructuring program
in connection with its One Cardinal Health initiative. The Company expects the program to be
substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2008 and expects it to improve operating earnings and
position the Company for future growth. If the restructuring program suffers unforeseen
difficulties, is delayed in its completion or results in unforeseen additional costs, the Company
may not achieve the operational and financial objectives it has set for the program, and the
Company&#146;s business, financial condition or operating results may not fully benefit from the
restructuring to the extent that the Company had initially anticipated.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, certain projects under the One Cardinal Health restructuring involve replacement
of legacy systems, consolidation and rationalization of employees and, in some cases, outsourcing.
During such transitions, it is possible the Company may suffer, at least on a temporary basis,
problems associated with internal control over financial reporting or business interruptions which
could arise as a result of such restructuring.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Downgrades of the Company&#146;s credit ratings could adversely affect the Company. </B>The Company&#146;s
senior debt credit ratings from S&#038;P, Moody&#146;s and Fitch are BBB, Baa3 and BBB&#043;, respectively, the

may adversely affect its ability to access capital and would result in an increase in the interest

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The Company could be adversely affected if transitions in senior management are not successful</B>.
The Company&#146;s operations depend in a large extent on the efforts of its senior management. Several
new members of senior management, including the Company&#146;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer &#150;
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Ethics and Compliance
Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller and Treasurer have recently joined the Company.
The Company seeks to develop and retain an effective management team through the proper positioning
of existing key employees and the addition of new management personnel where necessary. The
Company&#146;s operations could be adversely affected if transitions in senior management are not
successful or if the Company is unable to sustain an effective management team.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Increased costs for raw materials or raw material shortages may adversely affect the Company&#146;s
operating results. </B>As discussed more fully under &#147;Customers and Suppliers&#148; within &#147;Item&nbsp;1:
Business,&#148; the Company&#146;s manufacturing businesses within the Medical Products and Services and
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segments use a broad range of raw materials in the
products that they produce. In certain circumstances, the Company&#146;s operating results may be
adversely affected by increases in raw materials costs because the Company may not be able to fully
recover the increased costs from the customer or offset the increased cost through productivity
improvements. In addition, in the case where there are a limited number of suppliers for a
particular raw material or where the Company is constrained to use a particular supplier due to
customer requirements, regulatory filings or product approvals, the Company may experience
shortages in supply. This, in turn, could adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Increased fuel costs may adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results. </B>As discussed under
&#147;Customers and Suppliers&#148; within &#147;Item&nbsp;1: Business,&#148; the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution
business utilizes contract carriers to distribute its products. Contracts with these carriers
generally contain a fuel surcharge capped at a certain percentage. If fuel costs rise
significantly, the Pharmaceutical Distribution business may need to
increase the specified fuel surcharge, which is limited to specified
annual percentage increases,
with certain contract carriers. In the event that the Pharmaceutical Distribution business cannot
reach agreement on these changes, it may need to replace the contract carriers at prevailing market
rates. The Company&#146;s Medical Products and Services Distribution and Nuclear Pharmacy Services
businesses own their distribution fleets, which distribute a majority of their products to
customers. These businesses are directly impacted by market changes in the price of fuel. As a
result of the Company&#146;s exposure to fuel costs, the Company&#146;s operating results may be adversely
affected by increased fuel costs, as the Company may not be able to fully recover the increased costs
from its customers.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;30, 1996, Baxter International Inc. (&#147;Baxter&#148;) and its subsidiaries transferred
to Allegiance Corporation and its subsidiaries (&#147;Allegiance&#148;), Baxter&#146;s U.S. health care
distribution business, surgical and respiratory therapy business and health care cost-management
business, as well as certain foreign operations (the &#147;Allegiance Business&#148;) in connection with a
spin-off of the Allegiance Business by Baxter. In connection with this spin-off, Allegiance
Corporation, which later merged with a subsidiary of the Company on February&nbsp;3, 1999, agreed to indemnify
Baxter, and to defend and indemnify Baxter Healthcare Corporation, as contemplated by the
agreements between Baxter and Allegiance Corporation, for all expenses and potential liabilities
associated with claims arising from the Allegiance Business, including certain claims of alleged
personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex
gloves. Such claims, which name multiple defendants in addition to
Baxter/Allegiance, involved allegations of sensitization to natural
rubber latex products. The Company is not a
party to any of the lawsuits and has not agreed to pay any settlements to the plaintiffs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company reassessed its ability to estimate the
potential remaining costs of these lawsuits. Following this reassessment, during the first quarter
of fiscal 2005, the Company recognized a charge of $16.4&nbsp;million as its reasonable estimate of net
future costs to be incurred in defending or settling outstanding claims as well as pursuing
insurance recoveries. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company resolved claims
relating to substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for this litigation. Following
resolution of these claims, the Company concluded that it was in a position to reasonably estimate
the total remaining uninsured costs for this litigation. As such, during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Company recognized an additional charge of $11.8&nbsp;million as its reasonable
estimate of uninsured costs already incurred in defending or settling outstanding claims. While
the Company does not anticipate significant charges in future periods, additional charges may be
required if there is a significant increase in the number of new lawsuits filed. Currently, the
Company considers this potential event to be remote.

have settled in the past with the Company receiving proceeds from the settlement fund. Currently,
there are several such class actions pending in which the Company is a class member. Total

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">San Gabriel Environmental Claim
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegiance, through Baxter and its predecessors-in-interest, owned a facility located in
Irwindale, California (the &#147;Irwindale Property&#148;) from approximately 1961 to approximately 1999
where, among other things, plastics were manufactured, a chemical laboratory was operated, and
certain research and development activity was carried out. San Gabriel is a Superfund site in the
Los Angeles area that concerns ground water contamination of a local drinking water aquifer. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the &#147;U.S. EPA&#148;) is the lead government agency in charge of
the San Gabriel Valley Groundwater Basin Superfund Sites, Areas 1-4, Baldwin Park Operable Unit
(the &#147;BPOU&#148;). According to the U.S. EPA, the groundwater within the BPOU is contaminated. The
Irwindale Property is located approximately one mile away from the BPOU plume. The U.S. EPA named
Allegiance as a potentially responsible party (&#147;PRP&#148;) for the groundwater contamination in the
BPOU, along with a number of other PRPs. In June&nbsp;2000, the U.S. EPA issued a unilateral
administrative order (&#147;UAO&#148;) against a number of companies, including Allegiance. The UAO
requires, among other things, the design and implementation of the Interim Groundwater Remedy
selected by the U.S. EPA. This Interim Groundwater Remedy generally requires pumping contaminated
groundwater from the aquifer and treating it in accordance with federal and state government
standards in order to remove or reduce contaminants of concern and to stop the further migration of
contaminants. Allegiance has maintained that the Irwindale Property did not contribute to the
alleged ground water contamination. The levels of contaminants detected on the Irwindale Property
are below any state or federal standard requiring remediation or monitoring. The U.S. EPA has been
engaged in settlement discussions with Allegiance, and has not sued Allegiance in connection with
the UAO or the BPOU. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Allegiance accepted the U.S. EPA&#146;s
cash buy-out demand of $550,000 in satisfaction of Allegiance&#146;s share of costs for the Interim
Groundwater Remedy. Allegiance also agreed to pay the California Department of Toxic
Substances (&#147;DTSC&#148;) $16,050 in settlement of DTSC&#146;s claims related to the Interim Groundwater
Remedy. Allegiance has recorded environmental accruals, based upon information available, that it
reasonably believes are adequate to satisfy known costs. The Company reasonably believes that the
impact of this claim upon Allegiance will be immaterial to the Company&#146;s financial position,
liquidity and results of operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality brought suit against Baxter as a PRP along
with a number of other PRPs in 1994 in the Circuit Court of the State of Michigan for Ingham
County alleging contamination of the A-1 disposal site in Plainwell, Michigan (&#147;A-1 Plainwell&#148;).
Among the contaminants at the site were solvent wastes generated by Burdick &#038; Jackson (&#147;Burdick&#148;)
of Muskegon, Michigan. Baxter became a PRP through its acquisition of Burdick in 1986. Allegiance
agreed to defend and indemnify Baxter in this claim as part of the Baxter-Allegiance Spin-Off. The
principal relief sought was for the PRPs to clean up the site to applicable standards and to
reimburse the government for its oversight and other costs at the site. In a related action,
Allegiance, through its association with Baxter and Burdick, was named a PRP to reimburse the State
of Michigan for reimbursement costs associated with the construction of a landfill cap and
continued operation, maintenance and monitoring of the A-1 Sunrise site in Michigan (&#147;A-1
Sunrise&#148;). Allegiance has paid approximately $95,000 for past remediation costs at the A-1
Plainwell site and approximately $230,000 at the A-1 Sunrise site. Remediation of the A-1
Plainwell site is substantially complete, subject to minimal operation, maintenance and monitoring
of the site. Allegiance&#146;s share of future remediation at the A-1 Sunrise site is approximately
1.8%. Allegiance has recorded environmental accruals based upon the information available that it
reasonably believes are adequate to satisfy known costs. The Company reasonably believes that the
impact of these claims upon Allegiance will be immaterial to the Company&#146;s financial position,

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Burdick acquisition, Baxter was identified by the U.S. EPA as a PRP for
clean-up costs related to the Thermochem waste processing site in Muskegon, Michigan. Allegiance
agreed to defend and indemnify Baxter in this claim as part of the Baxter-Allegiance Spin-Off.
Based upon the information available, Allegiance reasonably believes the total clean-up cost of
this site to be between approximately $17&nbsp;million and $23&nbsp;million. A well-funded PRP group, of
which Allegiance is a member, has spent approximately $10&nbsp;million in clean-up costs. Allegiance
reasonably believes that current available funding of the PRP group, along with Allegiance&#146;s
additional recorded environmental accruals, are adequate to satisfy known costs. The Company
reasonably believes that the impact of this claim upon Allegiance will be immaterial to the
Company&#146;s financial position, liquidity and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Derivative Actions
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;8, 2002, a complaint was filed by a purported shareholder against the Company and
its directors in the Court of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Ohio, as a purported derivative
action. <I>Doris Staehr v. Robert D. Walter, et al., No.&nbsp;02-CVG-11-639</I>. On or about March&nbsp;21, 2003,
after the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint, an amended complaint was filed alleging
breach of fiduciary duties and corporate waste in connection with the alleged failure by the Board
of Directors of the Company to renegotiate or terminate the Company&#146;s proposed acquisition of
Syncor, and to determine the propriety of indemnifying Monty Fu, the former Chairman of Syncor.
The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the amended complaint, and the plaintiffs subsequently filed
a second amended complaint that added three new individual defendants and included new allegations
that, among other things, the Company improperly recognized revenue in December&nbsp;2000 and September
2001 related to settlements with certain vitamin manufacturers. The Company filed a Motion to
Dismiss the second amended complaint, and on November&nbsp;20, 2003, the Court denied the motion. On
April&nbsp;14, 2005, the Court stayed the action for a period of six months. The defendants intend to
vigorously defend this action. The Company currently does not believe that the impact of this
lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July&nbsp;1, 2004, three complaints have been filed by purported shareholders against the
members of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors, certain of its officers and employees and the Company
as a nominal defendant in the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio, as purported derivative
actions (collectively referred to as the &#147;Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative actions&#148;).
These cases include: <I>Donald Bosley, Derivatively on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. v. David Bing,
et al., Sam Wietschner v. Robert D. Walter, et al. </I>and <I>Green Meadow Partners, LLP, Derivatively on
behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. v. David Bing, et al</I>. The Cardinal Health Franklin County
derivative actions allege that the individual defendants failed to implement adequate internal
controls for the Company and thereby violated their fiduciary duty of good faith, GAAP and the
Company&#146;s Audit Committee charter. The complaints in the Cardinal Health Franklin County
derivative actions seek money damages and equitable relief against the defendant directors and an
award of attorney&#146;s fees. On November&nbsp;22, 2004, the Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative
actions were consolidated. Furthermore, by agreement of the parties, the Cardinal Health Franklin
County derivative actions have been stayed. None of the defendants has responded to the complaints
yet, nor has the Company.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July&nbsp;2, 2004, ten purported class action complaints have been filed by purported
purchasers of the Company&#146;s securities against the Company and certain of its officers and
directors, asserting claims under the federal securities laws (collectively referred to as the
&#147;Cardinal Health federal securities actions&#148;). To date, all of these actions have been filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases include: <I>Gerald
Burger v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 575), Todd Fener v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al.
(04 CV 579), E. Miles Senn v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 597), David Kim v. Cardinal

State of New Jersey v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 831) </I>and <I>First New York Securities, LLC
v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 911). </I>The Cardinal Health federal securities actions
purport to be brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Company&#146;s securities during various
periods beginning as early as October&nbsp;24, 2000 and ending as late as July&nbsp;26, 2004 and allege,
among other things, that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule&nbsp;10b-5
promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by issuing a series of false and/or
misleading statements concerning the Company&#146;s financial results, prospects and condition. Certain
of the complaints also allege violations of Section&nbsp;11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
claiming material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses issued by the Company in connection
with its acquisition of Bindley Western Industries, Inc. (which has been given the legal
designation of Cardinal Health 100, Inc. and is referred to in this Form 10-K as &#147;Bindley&#148;) in 2001
and Syncor in 2003. The alleged misstatements relate to the Company&#146;s accounting for recoveries
relating to antitrust litigation against vitamin manufacturers, and to classification of revenue in
the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either operating revenue or revenue from bulk
deliveries to customer warehouses, among other matters. The alleged misstatements are claimed to
have caused an artificial inflation in the Company&#146;s stock price during the proposed class period.
The complaints seek unspecified money damages and equitable relief against the defendants and an
award of attorney&#146;s fees. On December&nbsp;15, 2004, the Cardinal Health federal securities actions
were consolidated into one action captioned <I>In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Federal Securities
Litigation</I>, and on January&nbsp;26, 2005, the Court appointed the Pension Fund Group as lead plaintiff
in this consolidated action. On April&nbsp;22, 2005, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended
complaint naming the Company, certain current and former officers and employees and the Company&#146;s
external auditors as defendants. The complaint seeks unspecified money damages and other
unspecified relief against the defendants. On August&nbsp;22, 2005, the Company and certain defendants
filed a Motion to Dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July&nbsp;2, 2004, 15 purported class action complaints (collectively referred to as the
&#147;Cardinal Health ERISA actions&#148;) have been filed against the Company and certain officers,
directors and employees of the Company by purported participants in the Cardinal Health Profit
Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan (now known as the Cardinal Health 401(k) Savings Plan, or the
&#147;401(k) Plan&#148;). To date, all of these actions have been filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases include: <I>David McKeehan and James Syracuse v.
Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 643), Timothy Ferguson v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV

Health, Inc., et al. (05 C2 101). </I>The Cardinal Health ERISA actions purport to be brought on
behalf of participants in the 401(k) Plan and the Syncor Employees&#146; Savings and Stock Ownership
Plan (the &#147;Syncor ESSOP,&#148; and together with the 401(k) Plan, the &#147;Plans&#148;), and also on behalf of
the Plans themselves. The complaints allege that the defendants breached certain fiduciary duties
owed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#147;ERISA&#148;), generally asserting that the
defendants failed to make full disclosure of the risks to the Plans&#146; participants of investing in
the Company&#146;s stock, to the detriment of the Plans&#146; participants and beneficiaries, and that
Company stock should not have been made available as an investment alternative for the Plans&#146;
participants. The misstatements alleged in the Cardinal Health ERISA actions significantly overlap
with the misstatements alleged in the Cardinal Health federal securities actions. The complaints
seek unspecified money damages and equitable relief against the defendants and an award of
attorney&#146;s fees. On December&nbsp;15, 2004, the Cardinal Health ERISA actions were consolidated into
one action captioned <I>In re Cardinal Health, Inc. ERISA Litigation</I>. On January&nbsp;14, 2005, the court
appointed lead counsel and liaison counsel for the consolidated Cardinal Health ERISA action. On
April&nbsp;29, 2005, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended ERISA complaint naming the Company,
certain current and former directors, officers and employees, the Company&#146;s Employee Benefits
Policy Committee and Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company as defendants. The complaint seeks unspecified
money damages and other unspecified relief against the defendants. On August&nbsp;22, 2005, the Company
and certain defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the consolidated amended ERISA complaint.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleven purported class action lawsuits have been filed against Syncor and certain of its
officers and directors, asserting claims under the federal securities laws (collectively referred
to as the &#147;Syncor federal securities actions&#148;). All of these actions were filed in the United
States District Court for the Central District of California. These cases include <I>Richard Bowe v.
Syncor Int&#146;l Corp., et al., No.&nbsp;CV 02-8560 LGB (RCx) (C.D. Cal.), Alan Kaplan v. Syncor Int&#146;l

LGB (RCx) (C.D. Cal.)</I>. The Syncor federal securities actions purport to be brought on behalf of
all purchasers of Syncor shares during various periods, beginning as early as March&nbsp;30, 2000 and
ending as late as November&nbsp;5, 2002. The actions allege, among other things, that the defendants
violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a)
of the Exchange Act by issuing a series of press releases and public filings disclosing significant
sales growth in Syncor&#146;s international business, but omitting mention of certain allegedly improper
payments to Syncor&#146;s foreign customers, thereby artificially inflating the price of Syncor shares.
A lead plaintiff has been appointed by the Court in the Syncor federal securities actions, and a
consolidated amended complaint was filed May&nbsp;19, 2003, naming Syncor and 12 individuals, all former
Syncor officers, directors and/or employees, as defendants. The consolidated complaint seeks
unspecified money damages and other unspecified relief against the defendants. Syncor filed a
Motion to Dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on August&nbsp;1, 2003, and on December&nbsp;12, 2003,
the Court granted the Motion to Dismiss without prejudice. A second amended consolidated class
action complaint was filed on January&nbsp;28, 2004, naming Syncor and 14 individuals, all former Syncor
officers, directors and/or employees, as defendants. Syncor filed a Motion to Dismiss the second
amended consolidated class action complaint on March&nbsp;4, 2004. On July&nbsp;6, 2004, the Court granted
Defendants&#146; Motion to Dismiss without prejudice as to defendants Syncor, Monty Fu, Robert Funari
and Haig Bagerdjian. As to the other individual defendants, the Motion to Dismiss was granted with
prejudice. On September&nbsp;14, 2004, the lead plaintiff filed a Motion for Clarification of the
Court&#146;s July&nbsp;6, 2004 dismissal order. The court clarified its July&nbsp;6, 2004 dismissal order on
November&nbsp;29, 2004 and the lead plaintiff filed a third amended consolidated complaint on December
29, 2004. Syncor filed a Motion to Dismiss the third amended consolidated complaint on January&nbsp;31,
2005. On April&nbsp;15, 2005, the Court granted the Motion to Dismiss with prejudice. The lead
plaintiff has appealed this decision.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;14, 2002, two additional actions were filed by individual stockholders of Syncor
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the &#147;Delaware actions&#148;) against seven of
Syncor&#146;s nine directors (the &#147;director defendants&#148;). The complaints in each of the Delaware
actions were identical and alleged that the director defendants breached certain fiduciary duties
to Syncor by failing to maintain adequate controls, practices and procedures to ensure that
Syncor&#146;s employees and representatives did not engage in improper and unlawful conduct. Both
complaints asserted a single derivative claim, for and on behalf of Syncor, seeking to recover all
of the costs and expenses that Syncor incurred as a result of the allegedly improper payments
(including the costs of the Syncor federal securities actions described above), and a single
purported class action claim seeking to recover damages on behalf of all holders of Syncor shares
in the amount of any losses sustained if consideration received by Syncor stockholders in the
Company&#146;s merger with Syncor was reduced. On November&nbsp;22, 2002, the plaintiff in one of the two
Delaware actions filed an amended complaint adding as defendants the Company, its subsidiary Mudhen
Merger Corporation and the remaining two Syncor directors, who are hereafter included in the term
&#147;director defendants.&#148; These cases have been consolidated under the caption <I>In re Syncor
International Corp. Shareholders Litigation </I>(the &#147;consolidated Delaware action&#148;). On August&nbsp;14,
2003, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the operative complaint in the consolidated Delaware
action. At the end of September&nbsp;2003, plaintiffs in the consolidated Delaware action moved the
Court to file a second amended complaint. Plaintiffs&#146; request was granted in February&nbsp;2004. Monty
Fu was the only named defendant in the second amended complaint. On September&nbsp;15, 2004, the Court
granted Monty Fu&#146;s Motion to Dismiss the second amended complaint. The Court dismissed the second
amended complaint with prejudice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;18, 2002, two additional actions were filed by individual stockholders of Syncor
in the Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles (the &#147;California actions&#148;)
against the director defendants. The complaints in the California actions allege that the director
defendants breached certain fiduciary duties to Syncor by failing to maintain adequate controls,
practices and procedures to ensure that Syncor&#146;s employees and representatives did not engage in
improper and unlawful conduct. Both complaints asserted a single derivative claim, for and on
behalf of Syncor, seeking to recover costs and expenses

in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. A consolidated
complaint was filed on February&nbsp;24, 2004 against Syncor and certain former Syncor officers,
directors and/or employees alleging that the defendants breached certain fiduciary duties owed
under ERISA based on the same underlying allegations of improper and unlawful conduct alleged in
the federal securities litigation. The consolidated complaint seeks unspecified money damages and
other unspecified relief against the defendants. On April&nbsp;26, 2004, the defendants filed Motions
to Dismiss the consolidated complaint. On August&nbsp;24, 2004, the Court granted in part and denied in
part Defendants&#146; Motions to Dismiss. The Court dismissed, without prejudice, all claims against
defendants Ed Burgos and Sheila Coop, all claims alleging co-fiduciary liability against all
defendants, and all claims alleging that the individual defendants had conflicts of interest
precluding them from properly exercising their fiduciary duties under ERISA. A claim for breach of
the duty to prudently manage plan assets was upheld against Syncor, and a claim for breach of the
alleged duty to &#147;monitor&#148; the performance of Syncor&#146;s Plan Administrative Committee was upheld
against defendants Monty Fu and Robert Funari. In addition, the United States Department of Labor
is conducting an investigation of the Syncor ESSOP with respect to its compliance with ERISA
requirements. The Company has responded to a subpoena received from the Department of Labor and
continues to cooperate in the investigation.

currently does not believe that the impact of these actions will have a material adverse effect on
the Company&#146;s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. The Company believes the
allegations made in the complaints described above are without merit and it intends to vigorously
defend such actions. The Company has been informed that the individual director and officer
defendants deny liability for the claims asserted in these actions, believe they have meritorious
defenses and intend to vigorously defend such actions. The Company currently believes that a
portion of any liability will be covered by insurance policies that the Company and Syncor have
with financially viable insurance companies, subject to self-insurance retentions, exclusions,
conditions, coverage gaps, policy limits and insurer solvency.

<I>E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company v. Cardinal Health, Inc., BBA Materials Technology and BBA

categories of breach of contract, false advertising and patent infringement. The complaint does

matters, including but not limited to the establishment and adjustment of certain reserves and
their impact on quarterly earnings. The Audit Committee and its independent counsel also have

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the conclusions reached by the Audit Committee in September and October&nbsp;2004, the
Audit Committee began the task of assigning responsibility for the financial statement matters
described above which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K and in January&nbsp;2005 took disciplinary
actions with respect to the Company&#146;s employees who it determined bore responsibility for these
matters, other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for which there is a separate Board committee internal review (discussed below). The
disciplinary actions ranged from terminations or resignations of employment to required repayments
of some or all of fiscal 2003 bonuses from certain employees to letters of reprimand. These
disciplinary actions affected senior financial and managerial personnel, as well as other
personnel, at the corporate level and in the four business segments. None of the Company&#146;s current
corporate executive officers (who are identified under the heading &#147;Executive Officers of the
Company&#148; following Item&nbsp;4 of this Form 10-K) were the subject of disciplinary action by the Audit
Committee. In connection with the determinations made by the Audit Committee, the Company&#146;s
former controller resigned effective February&nbsp;15, 2005. The Audit Committee has completed its
determinations of responsibility for the financial statement matters described above which were
reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K, although responsibility for matters relating to the Company&#146;s
accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers has been addressed by a
separate committee of the Board. The Audit Committee internal review is substantially complete.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the SEC&#146;s formal investigation, a committee of the Board of Directors, with
the assistance of independent counsel, separately initiated an internal review to assign
responsibility for matters relating to the Company&#146;s accounting treatment of certain recoveries
from vitamin manufacturers. In the 2004 Form 10-K, as part of the Audit Committee&#146;s internal
review, the Company reversed its previous recognition of estimated recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years and recognized the income from such recoveries
as a special item in the period in which cash was received from the manufacturers. The SEC staff
had previously advised the Company that, in its view, the Company did not have an appropriate basis
for recognizing the income in advance of receiving the cash. In August&nbsp;2005, the separate Board
committee reached certain conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review and
determined that no additional disciplinary actions were required
beyond the disciplinary actions already taken by the Audit Committee,
as described above. The separate Board committee
internal review is substantially complete.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlement discussions have recently commenced with the SEC regarding resolution of
its investigation with respect to the Company. While these discussions are ongoing, there can be
no assurance that the Company&#146;s efforts to resolve the investigation with respect to the Company
will be successful, and the Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of these matters or the
terms of any such resolution. As a result of the initiation of these discussions, the Company
recorded a reserve of $25&nbsp;million for its fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2005 in respect of the SEC
investigation. Unless and until the SEC investigation is resolved, there can be no assurance that
the amount reserved by the Company for this investigation will be sufficient and that a larger
amount will not be required. Therefore, this reserve will be reviewed on a quarterly basis and
adjusted to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review and the
separate Board committee internal review remain ongoing, although the Audit Committee internal
review and the separate Board committee internal review are substantially complete. While the
Company is continuing in its efforts to respond to these inquiries and provide all information
required, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney
inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review or the separate Board committee internal review. The
outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry

the historical consolidated financial statements included in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for
the quarterly periods during fiscal 2005, or this Form 10-K will not change or require amendment,
or that additional disciplinary actions will not be required in such circumstances. As the SEC&#146;s
investigation, the U.S. Attorney&#146;s inquiry and the Audit Committee&#146;s internal review continue, the
Audit Committee may identify new issues, or make additional findings if it receives additional
information, that may have an impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and the
scope of the restatements described in the 2004 Form 10-K, the Forms 10-Q for the quarterly periods
during fiscal 2005, and this Form 10-K.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">FTC Investigation
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, the Company received a request for documents from the Federal Trade
Commission (&#147;FTC&#148;) that asks the Company to voluntarily produce certain documents to the FTC. The
document request, which does not allege any wrongdoing, is part of an FTC non-public investigation
to determine whether the Company may be engaging in anticompetitive practices with other wholesale
drug distributors in order to limit competition for provider customers seeking distribution
services. The Company is in the process of responding to the FTC request. Because the
investigation is at an early stage, the Company cannot predict its outcome or its effect, if any,
on the Company&#146;s business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">New York Attorney General Investigation
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2005, one of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries received a subpoena from the Attorney
General&#146;s Office of the State of New York. The Company believes that the New York Attorney General
is conducting a broad industry inquiry that appears to focus on, among other things, the secondary
market within the wholesale pharmaceutical industry. The Company is one of multiple parties that
have received such a subpoena. The Company has been producing documents and providing information
to the New York Attorney General&#146;s office in response to the April&nbsp;2005 subpoena as well as
subsequent informal requests. Because the investigation is at an early stage, the Company cannot
predict its outcome or its effect on the Company&#146;s business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the legal proceedings disclosed above, the Company also becomes involved from
time-to-time in other litigation incidental to its business, including, without limitation,
inclusion of certain of its subsidiaries as a potentially responsible party for environmental
clean-up costs as well as litigation in connection with future and prior acquisitions. The Company
intends to vigorously defend itself against such other litigation and does not currently believe
that the outcome of any such other litigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health care industry is highly regulated and government agencies continue to increase
their scrutiny over certain practices affecting government programs and otherwise. From time to
time<B>, </B>the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies.
The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a timely and thorough manner,
which responses sometimes require considerable time and effort, and can result in considerable
costs being incurred, by the Company. The Company expects to incur additional costs in the future
in connection with existing and future requests.

    <TD>During fiscal 2002, the Company recognized a benefit of approximately $23&nbsp;million as a result
of changes in the last-in, first-out (&#147;LIFO&#148;) calculation with respect to generic
products in order to more accurately reflect inflationary indices. The Company determined
that the cumulative effect of the change in LIFO methods was non-determinable due to the
unavailability of historical information needed to calculate the effect. Therefore, in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.&nbsp;20, the Company did not record the
adjustment as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of operations during the fiscal years noted in the table above reflect the breadth
of products and services the Company offers and the increasing demand for the Company&#146;s diverse
portfolio of products and services, which led to revenue growth in every segment of the Company.
The Company continues to experience strong demand from health care providers for the Company to
provide integrated solutions. Integrated solutions include products and services from multiple
lines of businesses within the Company, and currently represent approximately $7&nbsp;billion of annual
sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company&#146;s operations are organized into four reportable segments, Pharmaceutical
Distribution and Provider Services, Medical Products and Services, Pharmaceutical Technologies and
Services and Clinical Technologies and Services. See Note 18 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements&#148; for discussion of changes to business segments during fiscal 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution business is in a business model transition with
respect to how it is compensated for the logistical, capital and administrative services that it
provides to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Historically, the compensation received by the
Pharmaceutical Distribution business from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers was based on each
manufacturer&#146;s unique sales practices (e.g., volume of product available for sale, eligibility to
purchase product, cash discounts for prompt payment, rebates, etc.) and pharmaceutical pricing
practices (e.g., the timing, frequency and magnitude of product price increases). Specifically, a
significant portion of the compensation the Pharmaceutical Distribution business received from
manufacturers was derived from the Company&#146;s ability to purchase pharmaceutical inventory in
advance of pharmaceutical price increases, hold that inventory as manufacturers increased
pharmaceutical prices, and generate a higher operating margin on the subsequent sale of that
inventory. This compensation system was dependent to a large degree upon the sales practices of
each branded pharmaceutical manufacturer, including established policies concerning the volume of
product available for purchase in advance of a price increase, and on predictable pharmaceutical
pricing practices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in fiscal 2003, branded pharmaceutical manufacturers began to seek greater control
over the amount of pharmaceutical product available in the supply chain, and, as a result, began to
change their sales practices by restricting the volume of product available for purchase by
pharmaceutical wholesalers. In addition, manufacturers have increasingly sought more services from
the Company, including providing data concerning product sales and distribution patterns. The
Company believes that the manufacturers have sought these changes to provide them with greater
visibility over product demand and movement in the market and to increase product safety and
integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to, and distributed in, the
secondary market. These changes have significantly reduced the compensation received by the
Company from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. As a result of these actions by branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Company concluded it was no longer being adequately and
consistently compensated for the reliable and consistent logistical, capital and administrative
services being provided by the Company to these manufacturers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the developments discussed above, the Company has established a compensation
system that is significantly less dependent on manufacturers&#146; sales or pricing practices, and is
based on the services provided by the Company to meet the unique distribution requirements of each
manufacturer&#146;s products. During fiscal 2005, the Company worked with individual branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers to define fee-for-service terms that adequately compensate the Company
based on the services being provided to such manufacturers. The initial fee-for-service transition
is essentially complete, which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the transition to fee-for-service terms, certain of the new distribution service
agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an
inflation-based compensation component to them. Arrangements with certain other branded
manufacturers still continue to be solely inflation-based. If branded pharmaceutical price
inflation is lower than the

current exposure to contingent fee-based compensation in its

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Company believes that these adverse conditions impacted the Pyxis products business in the
short-term, and it remains confident in the long-term prospects for this business due
to the expected efficiencies from the formation of the Clinical Technologies and Services segment,
the greater efficiency to be realized from new installation processes and continuing customer
demand for products and services focusing on patient safety. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005, the Pyxis products business established momentum for fiscal 2006 as evidenced by its
increased committed contracts primarily for its new product, Pyxis MedStation 3000.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating earnings within the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment
declined during fiscal 2005. The decline was due in part to the continued delays in opening new
facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity within the Biotechnology and
Sterile Life Sciences business, including the Humacao, Puerto Rico facility. The Company decided to
close the sterile manufacturing facility in Humacao, Puerto Rico as part of the global
restructuring program associated with its One Cardinal Health initiative. These operations had
underperformed relative to Company expectations, due in part to continued regulatory issues at the
facility. The decision does not affect the Company&#146;s other operations in Puerto Rico or at other
locations worldwide. In addition, the operating earnings decline within this segment was also the
result of lower demand for medical communication services within the Healthcare Marketing Services
business. The adverse conditions experienced by the segment were partially offset by the strength
of certain softgel and controlled release products, as well as the year-over-year impact of
acquisitions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Global Restructuring Program</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
previously reported, during fiscal 2005, the Company launched a global restructuring
program in connection with its One Cardinal Health initiative with the goal of increasing the value
the Company provides its customers through better integration of existing businesses and improved
efficiency from a more disciplined approach to procurement and resource allocation. The Company
expects the program to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2008 and to improve operating
earnings and position the Company for future growth. The actual operating earnings improvements
for fiscal 2005 were estimated by the Company to have been in excess of the expected improvement of $125&nbsp;million. The program is
expected to improve operating earnings by approximately $190&nbsp;million for fiscal 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company expects the program to be implemented in two phases. The first phase of the
program focuses on business consolidations and process improvements, including rationalizing
facilities worldwide, reducing the Company&#146;s global workforce, and rationalizing and discontinuing
overlapping and under-performing product lines. See the Form 8-K filed by the Company on December
14, 2004 for a description of the costs the Company expects to incur in connection with the first
phase of the program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second phase of the program will focus on longer term integration activities that will
enhance service to customers through improved integration across the Company&#146;s segments, and
continue to streamline internal operations. See the Form 8-K filed by the Company on August&nbsp;5,
2005 for a description of the costs the Company expects to incur in connection with the second
phase of the program. See Notes 4 and 21 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for
discussion of the restructuring costs incurred by the Company during fiscal 2005 related to both
phases of the global restructuring program.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is currently the subject of a formal investigation by the SEC relating to certain
accounting matters and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York is
conducting an inquiry with respect to the Company. The Company&#146;s Audit Committee also is
conducting its own internal review, assisted by independent counsel, which internal review is
ongoing. In addition, a Board committee, with the assistance of independent counsel, is separately
conducting an internal review to assign responsibility for the matters relating to the Company&#146;s
accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers, which internal review is
also ongoing. Settlement discussions have recently commenced with the
SEC regarding
resolution of its investigation with respect to the Company, and the
Company has recorded a reserve of $25 million for fiscal 2005 in
respect of the SEC investigation.
 For further information regarding these matters, see &#147;Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;3: Legal
Proceedings&#148; and Note 1 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; in this Form 10-K.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry, including
the distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products, the Company is monitoring
issues regarding the safety of the supply chain for pharmaceuticals and other health care products.
The Company will continue to work proactively with all participants and regulators in the
pharmaceutical supply chain to help ensure it is safe and efficient. The Company continues to work
with its suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply
chain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Acquisitions</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;28, 2004, the Company acquired approximately 98.7% of the outstanding common stock of
Alaris, a provider of intravenous medication safety products and services. On July&nbsp;7, 2004, Alaris
merged with a subsidiary of the Company to complete the transaction. The value of the transaction,
including the assumption of Alaris&#146; debt, totaled approximately $2.1&nbsp;billion. For further
information regarding the Alaris acquisition, the valuation of the acquisition&#146;s intangibles, and
the impact on segment reporting, see Notes 4, 17 and 18 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.&#148;
 Prior to the completion of the ALARIS acquisition, on June 16, 2004,
ICU Medical, Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against ALARIS
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California. In the lawsuit, ICU claims that the ALARIS SmartSite&#174;
family of needle-free values and systems infringes upon ICU patents.
ICU seeks monetary damages plus permanent injunctive relief
preventing ALARIS from selling SmartSite&#174; products. On July 30,
2004, the Court denied ICU&#146;s application for a preliminary injunction
finding, among other things, that ICU had failed to show a
substantial likelihood of success on the merits. The Company intends
to vigorously defend this action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During December&nbsp;2003, the Company completed its acquisition of Intercare, an European
pharmaceutical products and services company. The cash transaction was valued at approximately
$570&nbsp;million, including the assumption of approximately $150&nbsp;million in Intercare debt. See Note
18 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further information regarding the impact
that this acquisition had on the Company&#146;s segment reporting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company completed numerous acquisitions, including,
Alaris, Intercare and Syncor. The Company&#146;s trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand
its role as a provider of services to the health care industry. This trend has resulted in
expansion into areas that complement the Company&#146;s existing operations and provide opportunities
for the Company to develop synergies with, and strengthen, the acquired business. As the health
care industry continues to change, the Company evaluates possible candidates for merger or
acquisition and intends to take advantage of opportunities to expand its role as a provider of
services to the health care industry through all its reporting segments. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to successfully take advantage of any such opportunity or consummate
any such transaction, if pursued. To the extent that the Company continues to pursue acquisitions,
its ability to complete such transactions may be adversely affected by the government
investigations described under &#147;Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;3: Legal Proceedings&#148; and Note 1 of &#147;Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; in this Form 10-K. If additional transactions are pursued or
consummated, the Company would incur additional merger- and acquisition-related costs, and may need
to enter into funding arrangements for such mergers or acquisitions. There can be no assurance
that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These increases during fiscal 2005 were partially offset by slower revenue growth within the

within this segment&#146;s core Pharmaceutical Distribution business. The most significant growth was
in &#147;Bulk Revenue&#148; (defined below), which increased approximately 34%. See the Bulk Revenue
discussion below for further details. In addition, annualized pharmaceutical price increases of
approximately 4.9% contributed to the growth in this segment. However, the rate of price increases
was lower than the rate experienced over the prior fiscal year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 2 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; in this Form 10-K,
during fiscal 2004, the Company decided to aggregate revenue classes. &#147;Operating Revenue&#148; and
&#147;Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other&#148; were combined for all periods presented so that
total revenue and total cost of products sold are presented as single amounts in the consolidated

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bulk Revenue for fiscal 2005 was $24.1&nbsp;billion compared to $18.0&nbsp;billion in fiscal 2004. The
increase in Bulk Revenue primarily relates to additional volume from existing and new customers as
well as market growth within the mail order business. The increase from existing customers is
primarily due to certain customers purchasing from the Company rather than directly from the
manufacturer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company continues to provide disclosure concerning its bulk sales due to the differences
in the nature and character of the business activities associated with bulk and non-bulk revenues.
Non-bulk activities tend to be more complex as the Company receives inventory in large or full case
sizes from the manufacturer, breaks it down into smaller sizes, warehouses the product, picks
products specific to a customer&#146;s order and delivers that order to customer locations (such as
retail pharmacies or individual hospitals) generally on a just-in-time basis and in small sizes.
While certain of the above activities occur with some bulk transactions, bulk typically involves
much larger sizes, generally in unopened cases or full pallets, which are shipped either directly
from the manufacturer or from the Company to customers&#146; own warehousing facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s classification of sales as bulk or non-bulk also corresponds to its four
business operations within Pharmaceutical Distribution. Applying the definition set forth above,
all revenue in the brokerage and trading operations is classified as bulk. All revenue in the
repackaging operation is classified as non-bulk. Within the core facilities operation, revenue is
classified as bulk or non-bulk on a customer-by-customer basis, based solely upon the type of
customer involved. Shipments to warehouses and processing centers (primarily retail chain and mail
order customers) are classified as bulk revenue. All other core facilities revenue is classified
as non-bulk revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This segment&#146;s revenue growth of 14% in fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from strong sales to
existing customers, sales to new customers and pharmaceutical price increases. Sales growth to
existing customers within the retail chain and alternate site categories in this segment&#146;s
Pharmaceutical Distribution business showed particular strength. This segment also benefited from
contract wins during fiscal 2004, pharmaceutical price increases averaging approximately 6.2%
during fiscal 2004 and an extra business day. These revenue gains were partially dampened by
continued reduction in business with Kmart Holding Corp. (&#147;Kmart&#148;) due to Kmart&#146;s closure of
various stores and certain contract losses during fiscal 2004 in this segment&#146;s Pharmaceutical
Distribution business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Medical Products and Services.</I></U> The Medical Products and Services revenue growth of 7%
in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from increased volume from existing customers, new contracts
signed during fiscal 2004 within the medical-surgical distribution business, strong international
growth, especially in Canada and Europe, favorable foreign exchange translation and increased
revenue from the Specialty Distribution business. The 6% growth in the medical-surgical
distribution business was primarily from increased sales to hospital supply and ambulatory care customers and
the 11% growth within the Specialty Distribution business resulted from increased revenue from the
business&#146; largest customer and growth of the existing customer base. This segment&#146;s revenue growth
was adversely affected by slower growth in the sale of self-manufactured products, and the loss of
certain business from customers within a GPO.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Specialty Distribution business&#146; largest customer has notified the Company that they will
begin self distribution on January&nbsp;1, 2006 which will significantly impact revenue and operating
earnings for this business during the second half of fiscal 2006. This customer represented
approximately $1.5&nbsp;billion or 16% of this segment&#146;s fiscal 2005 revenue. The Company plans to
partially mitigate this loss through the addition of a large, new customer agreement signed in April
2005 and cost cutting measures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This segment&#146;s revenue growth of 14% in fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from increased sales
momentum from new and existing contracts within the distribution business as well as from increased
sales volume from the segment&#146;s international businesses. New contracts drove increased sales of
both distributed and self-manufactured products, with sales from the distribution business
particularly strong during fiscal 2004. The international businesses also generated strong revenue
growth,
increasing nearly 19% from the prior fiscal year. Approximately 14% of the international
business revenue growth related to

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">changes in foreign currency rates. Sales of new
self-manufactured products, particularly enhancements within surgeon glove products, also
contributed to the overall revenue growth. This segment&#146;s revenue growth was above industry

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services.</I></U> The Pharmaceutical Technologies and
Services segment&#146;s revenue growth of 6% in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from strong demand for
certain softgel products, the impact of acquisitions, primarily Intercare and the acquisition of
Geodax within the Nuclear Pharmacy Services business, and the impact of foreign exchange rates.
Revenue growth was offset by certain regulatory issues as noted below. The net impact of
acquisitions and divestitures within this segment accounted for approximately 5% of the revenue
growth in fiscal 2005. Revenue in fiscal 2005 increased by approximately 2% as a result of the
impact of foreign exchange rates. This impact takes into consideration the fiscal 2005 rate
fluctuations due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar and the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment
(see footnote 6 to the table in Note 18 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for
additional discussion as it relates to fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment). The segment&#146;s growth
was adversely affected by the continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities
operating below planned capacity within the Company&#146;s Biotechnology and Sterile Life Sciences
business, including underperformance at the Humacao, Puerto Rico facility. The segment&#146;s growth
was also adversely affected by lower demand for medical communication services within the
Healthcare Marketing Services business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This segment&#146;s revenue growth of 25% in fiscal 2004 resulted from acquisitions and sales
momentum within the Pharmaceutical Development, Nuclear Pharmacy Services and Packaging Services
businesses. Approximately 5% of this segment&#146;s revenue growth was due to the inclusion of
Intercare, an acquisition completed during December&nbsp;2003. Intercare&#146;s results of operations are
not included in the prior period amounts. Intercare&#146;s operations had considerable sales momentum
after the acquisition was completed, particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Also, this
segment&#146;s revenue growth benefited from the inclusion of Syncor, an acquisition that was completed
on January&nbsp;1, 2003. Syncor&#146;s results of operations are not included in the amounts for the first
half fiscal 2003. Acquisitions within this segment accounted for approximately 23% of the revenue
growth during fiscal 2004.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This segment&#146;s fiscal 2004 revenue growth was partially dampened by a delay in startup of
commercial manufacturing of key sterile products from signed contracts as certain regulatory
inspections and product approvals were delayed in the Biotechnology and Sterile Life Sciences
business. Revenue growth was not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations as the Company applied
constant exchange rates to translate its foreign operations&#146; revenue into U.S. dollars. The impact
of actual foreign exchange rate changes for translation purposes is retained within the Corporate
segment (see footnote 6 of the table in Note 18 in &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Clinical Technologies and Services.</I></U> The Clinical Technologies and Services revenue
growth of 41% in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from the impact of the acquisition of Alaris and
strong revenue growth within the Clinical Services and Consulting business offset by significant
revenue declines within the Pyxis products business. The Alaris acquisition accounted for
approximately 41% of this segment&#146;s total revenue growth for fiscal 2005. Alaris&#146; results of operations are not
included in the prior period amounts. The Pyxis products business experienced a revenue decline of
approximately 17% in fiscal 2005 due to the following:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes that these adverse conditions impacted the Pyxis products business&#146; in
the short-term, and it remains confident in the long-term prospects for this business
due to the expected efficiencies from the formation of the Clinical Technologies and Services
segment, the greater efficiency to be realized from new installation processes and continuing
customer demand for products and services focusing on patient safety. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Pyxis products business established momentum for fiscal 2006 as evidenced by its
increased committed contracts primarily for its new product, Pyxis MedStation 3000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal 2004, the Pyxis products business sold portions of its leased asset portfolio at the
direction of Corporate. The proceeds were transferred to Corporate, and the Pyxis products
business subsequently received a $21.0&nbsp;million allocation from Corporate related to the estimated
interest income that would have been earned had the associated lease portfolios not been sold.
This allocation was recorded within revenue, consistent with the recording of interest income
received from sales-type leases. Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Pyxis products
business did not receive this Corporate allocation. See footnote 6 to
the table in Note 18 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for further details.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clinical Technologies and Services segment&#146;s revenue growth of 10% in fiscal 2004 is
reflective of the premature revenue recognition adjustment resulting from the Audit Committee&#146;s
internal review as more fully described in Note 1 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148;
Operationally, this segment&#146;s revenue growth in fiscal 2004 included sales growth within the
medication product lines (such as the Pyxis
MedStation<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174; </SUP>system), the addition of new
products and 12% growth within the Clinical Services and Consulting business. This
segment was adversely affected by a softening of demand at the hospital level for Pyxis products.
As discussed above, in order to aid in the comparability of this segment&#146;s operating results,
during fiscal 2004, the Company recorded a Corporate allocation adjustment to this segment&#146;s
revenue of $21.0&nbsp;million representing an estimate of interest income this segment would have earned
had the Company not completed sales of its lease receivables.

<DIV style="margin-top: 6pt"><TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font-size: 10pt">



</TABLE>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall increase in gross margin in fiscal 2004 reflects the increased contributions from
the Company&#146;s operating segments outside of the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services
segment, which generate higher gross margins and operating earnings (as a percentage of revenue).
These segments accounted for more than one-half of the Company&#146;s operating earnings. Acquisitions
completed by the Company accounted for approximately 3% of the operating earnings growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in revenue and gross margin were partially offset by a 4% increase in selling,
general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2004 as well as an increase of $17.5&nbsp;million in
the Company&#146;s special items. The overall increase in operating expenses was primarily a result of
the additional expenses resulting from acquisitions, higher personnel costs associated with overall
business growth and an increase in depreciation and amortization costs. Additionally, the Company
continued to invest in research and development and strategic initiatives that will benefit future
periods. Investments of approximately $115&nbsp;million in fiscal 2004 were charged against current
operating earnings as incurred. These increases in selling, general and administrative expenses
were offset partially by a reduction versus the prior fiscal year in incentive compensation
expenses of approximately $64&nbsp;million due to the performance of the Company&#146;s consolidated
operations relative to management&#146;s expectations and established financial performance metrics.
Such reduction affected all of the Company&#146;s business segments. The expense increases were also
offset by adjustments of certain trade receivable reserves and lower bad debt expenses, with a
combined impact of approximately $10&nbsp;million, due to changes in customer-specific credit exposures
and improvements in customer credit, billing and collection processes yielding significant
reductions in past due and uncollectible accounts. In addition, operating earnings included $11.5
million of net gains on the sale of certain businesses and assets which were recorded in
&#147;impairment charges and other.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services.</I></U> The Pharmaceutical Distribution
and Provider Services operating earnings decreased 2% during fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of
reduced vendor margins resulting from changes in branded pharmaceutical manufacturers&#146; sales and
pricing practices, as discussed above in the &#147;Overview&#148; section, and competitive pricing pressures.
As discussed above, branded pharmaceutical manufacturers have changed their sales practices by
restricting product available for purchase by pharmaceutical wholesalers. In addition, branded
pharmaceutical manufacturers&#146; product pricing practices have become less predictable, as the
frequency of price increases has slowed and the amounts have decreased versus historical levels.
For fiscal 2005, annualized pharmaceutical price increases were approximately 4.9% compared to 6.2%
in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the Company worked with individual branded pharmaceutical
manufacturers to define fee-for-service terms that adequately compensate the Company based on the
services being provided to such manufacturers. The initial fee-for-service transition is
essentially complete, which should help reduce earnings volatility in the segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
segment&#146;s operating earnings were also favorably impacted by $31.7&nbsp;million
from changes in the LIFO reserve primarily due to price deflation within generic pharmaceutical
inventories, lower inventory levels and lower price increases related to branded pharmaceutical
inventories. Operating earnings were also impacted by improved margins from generic products and
expense control within the Pharmaceutical Distribution business which resulted in lowering selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. In addition, operating earnings
during fiscal 2005 were adversely impacted by approximately $14.7&nbsp;million for inventory reserves
related to a generic manufacturer&#146;s bankruptcy, approximately $10.0&nbsp;million related to slow moving
inventory reserves and approximately $7.8&nbsp;million as a result of inventory rationalization of
certain health and beauty care products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This segment&#146;s operating earnings decreased 2% during fiscal 2004 primarily due to reduced
vendor margins caused by the changing business model within the Pharmaceutical Distribution
business (as further described in the &#147;Overview&#148; section) and the impact of competitive pricing.
Other adjustments within the Pharmaceutical Distribution business that negatively impacted this
segment in fiscal 2004 included an increase in inventory valuation and vendor dispute reserves in
the fourth quarter of approximately $11.7&nbsp;million and an adverse adjustment in the third quarter of
approximately $9.2&nbsp;million for vendor margins. In addition, one of several aspects of the business
model transition adversely impacting Pharmaceutical Distribution&#146;s year-over-year operating
earnings was the change in estimation of vendor margin with generic, health and beauty products and
pharmaceutical manufacturers with an impact of approximately $15.3&nbsp;million. These declines were
partially offset by the following:

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Medical Products and Services.</I></U> The Medical Products and Services segment&#146;s operating
earnings decreased 3% during fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of pricing pressures related to
self-manufactured products, increased raw material and fuel costs, an increased mix of lower margin
distributed products, and competitive pricing on a large GPO contract. Operating earnings were
also adversely impacted by a $28.2&nbsp;million charge for latex litigation as more fully described
within Note 11 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148; Selling, general and
administrative expenses grew 10% during fiscal 2005 primarily due to the charge for latex
litigation described above and higher personnel costs associated with the overall business growth.
These items were partially offset by revenue growth of 7%, manufacturing efficiencies, expense
control related to the Company&#146;s global restructuring program and incremental operating earnings
from new customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This segment&#146;s operating earnings growth of 11% during fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from
revenue growth of 14% during the same time period, led by sales momentum from distribution
contracts and gains within international markets. This segment also realized manufacturing
productivity improvements resulting in gross margin gains. In addition, operating earnings
benefited from lower incentive compensation expense versus prior year. This segment&#146;s operating
earnings growth was partially dampened by the increased mix of lower margin distributed products,
competitive pricing within the industry and an increase of approximately $9&nbsp;million in raw material
prices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services.</I></U> The Pharmaceutical Technologies and
Services segment&#146;s operating earnings decreased 28% during fiscal 2005 primarily due to the
continued delays in opening new facilities and existing facilities operating below planned capacity
within the Company&#146;s Biotechnology and Sterile Life Sciences business, including underperformance
at the Humacao, Puerto Rico facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company
decided to close the sterile manufacturing facility in Humacao, Puerto Rico as part of its global
restructuring program. These operations had underperformed relative to Company expectations, due
in part to continued regulatory issues at the facility. The decision does not affect the Company&#146;s
other operations in Puerto Rico or at other locations worldwide.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the operating earnings in this segment&#146;s Healthcare Marketing Services business
were adversely affected by lower demand for medical communication services. Operating earnings
were also adversely impacted by approximately $8.0&nbsp;million related to the write down of inventory
within the Biotechnology and Sterile Life Sciences business. The operating earnings declines were
partially offset by the strength of certain softgel and controlled release products, and the
year-over-year impact of acquisitions of approximately 6%. The impact of foreign exchange rates on
operating earnings did not significantly affect the fiscal 2005 growth rates above. This takes
into consideration the fiscal 2005 rate fluctuations due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar and
the fiscal 2004 constant rate adjustment. See footnote 6 to the table in Note 18 of &#147;Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional discussion as it relates to the fiscal 2004
constant rate adjustment and the change made in fiscal 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This segment&#146;s operating earnings growth of 26% during fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from
revenue growth of 25% during the same time period, with sales momentum in the
Pharmaceutical Development, Nuclear Pharmacy Services and Packaging Services businesses showing
particular strength. This segment also benefited from acquisitions completed by the Company,
specifically Intercare and Syncor. The acquisition of Intercare was completed during the second
quarter fiscal 2004 and, therefore, its results of operations are not included in the prior period.
Also, Syncor&#146;s results of operations are not included in the first half of fiscal 2003 because the
acquisition was completed on January&nbsp;1, 2003. Acquisitions within this segment accounted for approximately 18% of the operating earnings growth during fiscal 2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This segment&#146;s gross margin as a percentage of revenue was negatively impacted by the increase
in services provided by the Nuclear Pharmacy Services business, which has a lower gross margin
ratio as compared to the other businesses within this segment. The segment&#146;s operating earnings
also benefited year-over-year by reduced incentive compensation expenses. Operating earnings
growth was dampened by the delay in startup of commercial manufacturing of certain sterile products
as discussed in this segment&#146;s Revenue discussion. In addition, this segment&#146;s fiscal 2004
operating earnings growth was not impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations as the Company applied
constant exchange rates to translate its foreign operations&#146; operating earnings into U.S. dollars.
The impact of actual foreign exchange rate changes for translation purposes was retained within the
Corporate segment in fiscal 2004. See footnote 6 to the table in Note 18 in &#147;Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements&#148; for additional discussion as it relates to the fiscal 2004 constant rate
adjustment and the change made in fiscal 2005.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alaris acquisition improved operating earnings by approximately 26% for fiscal 2005. The
results of operations from this acquisition are not included in the prior period amounts.
Operating results from Alaris, while incremental to the segment&#146;s results year-over-year, were
adversely impacted by the effect of purchase accounting adjustments recorded during the first two
quarters of fiscal 2005. These adjustments included an inventory valuation adjustment to &#147;fair
value&#148; and the adjusted, higher cost inventory being sold, which adversely affected gross margins
by approximately $23.6&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This segment&#146;s operating earnings growth of 6% during fiscal 2004 was impacted by the
premature revenue recognition adjustment resulting from the Audit Committee&#146;s internal review as
more fully described in Note 1 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148; This segment&#146;s
operating earnings growth during fiscal 2004 resulted, in part, from this segment&#146;s revenue growth
of 10% during the same time period in conjunction with operational improvements within the Pyxis
products business and expense control within the Clinical Services and Consulting business. In
addition, this segment benefited from a reduction in receivable reserves and lower bad debt
expenses, with a combined impact of approximately $8.2&nbsp;million, due to improvements in
customer-specific credit matters and general improvements in customer credit, billing and
collection procedures, resulting in significant reductions in past due and uncollectible accounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The segment&#146;s fiscal 2004 operating earnings also benefited year-over-year from reduced
incentive compensation expenses and a Corporate expense allocation of $1.5&nbsp;million. As mentioned
in this segment&#146;s revenue discussion, the Company recorded, for comparative purposes, a Corporate
allocation of $21.0&nbsp;million to this segment representing estimated interest income this segment would
have earned had the Company not initiated the sale of its lease receivables. See this segment&#146;s
discussion under &#147;Revenue&#148; for additional information regarding this allocation entry in fiscal
2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Interest Expense and Other</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Interest expense and other&#148; increased $23.1&nbsp;million during fiscal 2005 primarily from
increased interest expense of $54.8&nbsp;million due to increased borrowing levels and rates. The
Company manages its exposure to interest rates using various hedging strategies (see Notes 3 and 7
in &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;). The $54.8&nbsp;million increase in interest expense
during fiscal 2005 was partially offset by the Company recording the minority interest impact of
approximately $19.4&nbsp;million for certain impairment charges within the Pharmaceutical Technologies
and Services segment&#146;s Oral Technologies business. These impairment charges were recorded within
&#147;impairment charges and other&#148; on the consolidated statements of earnings during fiscal 2005. See
Note 21 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional information regarding
&#147;impairment charges and other.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in &#147;interest expense and other&#148; of $4.1&nbsp;million during fiscal 2004 resulted
primarily from the adverse year-over year impact of foreign exchange
rates and the impact of a gain
recognized in fiscal 2003 related to a speculative interest rate swap
transaction, which were
partially offset by decreased interest expense.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Provision for Income Taxes</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions for income taxes relative to earnings before income taxes, discontinued
operations and cumulative effect of changes in accounting were 35.8% of pretax earnings in fiscal
2005, 31.9% in fiscal 2004 and 33.6% in fiscal 2003. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2005
includes tax expense related to a planned repatriation of foreign earnings as provided for in the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;) (see the following paragraph). Generally,
fluctuations in the effective tax rate are due to changes within state and foreign
effective tax rates resulting from the Company&#146;s business mix and changes in the tax impact of
special items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item and the
taxing jurisdiction. The Company&#146;s effective tax rate reflects tax benefits derived from
increasing operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the
U.S. statutory rate of 35%. The Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under a tax
incentive agreement expiring in 2019, as well as a tax agreement in place with Thailand that
expires in 2013.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. A provision of the AJCA creates a temporary
incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an
85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined that it will repatriate $500
million of accumulated foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of
the AJCA, and accordingly has recorded a related tax liability of $26.3&nbsp;million as of June&nbsp;30,
2005. The $500&nbsp;million is the maximum repatriation available to the Company under the repatriation
provisions of the AJCA. See Note 8 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional
information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Earnings/(Loss) from Discontinued Operations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Note 22 in &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for information on the Company&#146;s
discontinued operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><B>CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SENSITIVE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact
on the presentation of the Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations, and require use
of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management&#146;s judgment. Because
of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.
Below are those policies applied in preparing the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements that
management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For
additional accounting policies, see Note 3 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.&#148;
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Allowance for doubtful accounts. </B>Trade receivables are amounts owed to the Company through its
operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company also
provides financing to various customers. Such financing arrangements range from one to ten years
at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation. These financings may be
collateralized, guaranteed by third parties or unsecured. Finance notes and accrued interest
receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and are included in other
assets. Extending credit terms and calculating the required allowance for doubtful accounts
involve the use of judgment by the Company&#146;s management.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes general and
specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable agings, industry trends, customer
financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the
probability of collection. The Company continuously monitors the collectibility of its receivable
portfolio by analyzing the aging of its accounts receivable, assessing credit worthiness of its
customers and evaluating the impact of changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks.
If the frequency or severity of customer defaults increases due to changes in customers&#146; financial
condition or general economic conditions, the Company&#146;s allowance for uncollectible accounts may
require adjustment.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of customer receivables was 2.9% and 3.3%
at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease was a result of adjustments to certain trade
receivable reserves due to changes in customer-specific credit exposures, historical write-off
trends, and improvements in customer credit, billing and collections processes. A hypothetical
0.1% increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables to the fiscal 2005
reserve would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of approximately $4.4&nbsp;million.
The Company believes the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal year 2005 are
appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. The total reserve at June&nbsp;30,
2005 and 2004 exceeds the total Company receivable balance greater than 60&nbsp;days past due at those
same dates. See Schedule&nbsp;II included in this Form 10-K which includes a rollforward of activity
for these allowance reserves.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Inventories.
</B>A substantial portion of inventories
(approximately 67% in 2005 and 66% in 2004)
are stated at the lower of cost, using the LIFO method, or market.
These inventories are included within the core distribution facilities
within the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution business and are
primarily merchandise inventories. The remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of
cost, using the first-in, first-out (&#147;FIFO&#148;) method, or market. If the Company had used the FIFO
method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have
increased $26.0&nbsp;million and $57.8&nbsp;million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;142 &#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#148; Under SFAS No.&nbsp;142, purchased
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for
impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. Accordingly, the Company does not
amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets with finite
lives, primarily customer relationships and patents and trademarks, continue to be amortized over
their useful lives.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conducting the impairment test, the fair value of the Company&#146;s reporting units is compared
to its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, then no
impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, further analysis is performed to
assess impairment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s impairment analysis is based on a review of the price/earnings ratio for
publicly traded companies similar in nature, scope and size or a discounted cash flow analysis.
The use of alternative estimates, peer groups or changes in the industry could affect the estimated
fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment. Any identified impairment would
result in adjustment to the Company&#146;s results of operations. The Company performed its annual
impairment tests in fiscal 2005 and 2004, neither of which resulted in the recognition of any
impairment charges. See Note 17 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional
information regarding goodwill.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Business Combinations. </B>Assumptions and estimates are used in determining the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase
price in many of the Company&#146;s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets which require
management to use significant judgment in determining fair value. The Company typically utilizes
third-party valuation experts (&#147;Valuation Experts&#148;) for this process. In addition, current and
future amortization expense for such intangibles is impacted by purchase price allocations as well
as the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles, excluding goodwill. The Company
believes the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current
facts and circumstances.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the review of a transaction, the Valuation Experts assess the status of
the acquired company&#146;s research and development projects to determine the existence of in-process
research and development (&#147;IPR&#038;D&#148;). The Company has not historically recorded significant costs
related to IPR&#038;D. However, in conjunction with the acquisition of Alaris, the Company was

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">required to estimate the fair value of acquired IPR&#038;D which required selecting an appropriate
discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project. Management also assessed the
current status of development, nature and timing of efforts to complete such development,
uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value. Costs were not assigned to IPR&#038;D
unless future development was probable. Once the fair value was determined, an asset was
established and, as required by GAAP immediately written-off as a special item in the Company&#146;s consolidated statement
of earnings. The Company recorded $12.7&nbsp;million as a special item in fiscal 2004 representing an
estimate of Alaris&#146; IPR&#038;D (see Note 4 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Special Items. </B>The Company&#146;s special items consist primarily of costs that relate to
the integration of previously acquired companies or costs of restructuring operations to improve
productivity. Integration costs from acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests
method have been recorded in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (&#147;EITF&#148;) Issue No.&nbsp;94-3,
&#147;Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs incurred in a Restructuring),&#148; and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
No.&nbsp;100, &#147;Restructuring and Impairment Charges.&#148; Certain costs related to these acquisitions, such
as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs, were recognized at the date the
integration plan was adopted by management. Certain other integration costs that did not meet the
criteria for accrual at the commitment date have been expensed as the integration plan has been
implemented.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs associated with integrating acquired companies under the purchase method are
recorded in accordance with EITF Issue No.&nbsp;95-3, &#147;Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a
Purchase Business Combination.&#148; Certain costs to be incurred by the Company, as the acquirer, such
as employee and lease terminations and other facility exit costs, are recognized at the date the
integration plan is committed to and adopted by management. Certain other integration costs that
do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as the integration plan is
implemented.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the third quarter fiscal 2003, the Company implemented SFAS No.&nbsp;146,
&#147;Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,&#148; to account for costs incurred
in restructuring activities. Under this standard, a liability for most types of exit costs is
recognized as incurred. As discussed above, the Company previously accounted for costs associated
with restructuring activities under EITF Issue No.&nbsp;94-3, which required the Company to recognize a
liability for restructuring costs on the date of the commitment to an exit plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the special items related to acquisitions and restructurings can be classified
in one of the following categories: employee-related costs, exit costs (including lease termination
costs), asset impairments and other integration costs. Employee costs include severance and
termination benefits. Lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees, forfeited deposits
and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income. Other
facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other
costs incurred to shut down a facility. Asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of
the Company&#146;s assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities. Other integration
costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs
related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs
directly associated with the integration plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also records settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent,
non-recurring or unusual in nature as special items. In addition, costs related to legal fees and
document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the SEC investigation and
the Audit Committee internal review and related matters are also classified as special items.
See Note 4 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional information.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Vendor Reserves. </B>In determining an appropriate vendor reserve, the Company assesses historical
experience and current outstanding claims. The Company researches and resolves contested
transactions based on discussions with vendors, Company policy and findings of research performed.
At any given time, there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution. The
ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than the Company&#146;s original estimate and may
require adjustment. However, the Company believes reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate
based upon current facts and circumstances.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Income Tax Reserves. </B>The Company has established an estimated liability for federal, state
and foreign income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under SFAS No.&nbsp;5,
&#147;Accounting for Contingencies.&#148; This liability addresses a number of issues for which the Company
may have to pay additional taxes (and interest) when all examinations by taxing authorities are
concluded.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such
matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period. The liability
amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances, a
thorough research of the technical merits of the Company&#146;s arguments, and an assessment of the
probability of the Company prevailing in its arguments. In all cases, the Company considers
previous findings of the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company
generally consults with external tax advisers in reaching its

significant change in facts or circumstances has occurred and been formally documented.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Loss Contingencies. </B>The Company accrues for contingencies related to litigation in accordance with
SFAS No.&nbsp;5, which requires the Company to assess contingencies to determine degree of probability
and range of possible settlement. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the Company&#146;s
consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the settlement can be reasonably estimated. Assessing contingencies is highly subjective
and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to
determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of ultimate settlement
may differ from these estimates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Self Insurance Accruals. </B>The Company is self-insured for employee medical and dental insurance
programs. The Company had recorded liabilities totaling $26.0&nbsp;million and $23.0&nbsp;million for
estimated costs related to outstanding claims at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These costs
include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims, administrative fees and an estimate
for claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on the Company&#146;s assessment of
outstanding claims, historical analysis and current payment trends. The Company records an
estimate for the claims incurred but not reported using an estimated lag period. This lag period
assumption has been consistently applied for the periods presented. If the lag period was
hypothetically adjusted by a period equal to a half month, the impact on earnings would be $5.5
million. However, the Company believes the liabilities recorded are adequate based upon current
facts and circumstances.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has certain deductibles or is self-insured for various claims including
general liability, product, pharmacist professional, auto and workers&#146; compensation. The Company
had recorded liabilities totaling $66.4&nbsp;million and $48.0&nbsp;million for anticipated costs related to
general liability and workers&#146; compensation at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These costs
include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs and an estimate for
claims incurred but not reported. These estimates are based on the Company&#146;s assessment of
outstanding claims, historical analysis, actuarial information and current payment trends. The
amount of ultimate liability in respect to these matters may differ from these estimates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Operating activities.</U> Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2005
totaled approximately $2.9&nbsp;billion, an increase of $225.5&nbsp;million when compared to fiscal 2004.
The increase was primarily the result of net proceeds of $550&nbsp;million during the year under the
Company&#146;s committed receivables sales facility program. See Note 10 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements&#148; for information regarding this program. Overall, the operating cash flow
benefits were adversely affected by a $478.0&nbsp;million decrease in earnings from continuing
operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting. A significant portion of the earnings
decrease was due to non-cash asset impairments of approximately $223.9&nbsp;million. For further
discussion of changes in the Company&#146;s earnings from continuing operations, see the &#147;Results of
Operations&#148; section above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;27, 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the purchase of
up to $1.0&nbsp;billion of its Common Shares as management deems appropriate and a dividend increase to
$0.06 per share effective the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Based on this rate, the Company
expects fiscal 2006 dividends to total $0.24 per share, a doubling of the Company&#146;s previous annual
dividend policy of $0.12 per share. However, all future dividends are subject to approval by the
Company&#146;s Board of Directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash provided by operating activities nearly doubled during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal
2003 primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and increased earnings from continuing
operations. The primary driver of the increase in accounts payable was the timing of payments at
fiscal year-end, as well as inventory buys executed shortly before fiscal year-end within the
Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution business. In addition, as a result of certain non-recurring
end of year arrangements, payments to vendors in fiscal 2004 were reduced by $258&nbsp;million due to
the acceleration of payments at June&nbsp;30, 2003 to selected pharmaceutical vendors. Such
arrangements resulted in changes to the original payment terms with the vendors for which an

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">economic consideration was exchanged between the parties. The Company&#146;s overall investment in
inventories declined during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due primarily to the changing
business model of the Pharmaceutical Distribution business (see the &#147;Overview&#148; section earlier
within &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148;).
For further discussion of changes in the Company&#146;s earnings from continuing operations, see the
&#147;Results of Operations&#148; section. Additionally, the Company&#146;s operating cash flow benefited by
approximately $99.3&nbsp;million during fiscal 2004 due to sales of lease receivables from the Company&#146;s
Clinical Technologies and Services segment. See Note 10 in &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements&#148; for information regarding sales of lease receivables.

2003 primarily represents the Company&#146;s use of cash to complete acquisitions which expand its role
as a provider of services to the health care industry (see &#147;Acquisitions and Divestitures&#148; within
&#147;Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;1: Business&#148; for further information regarding the Company&#146;s acquisitions) and
capital spending to develop and enhance the Company&#146;s infrastructure, including facilities,
information systems and other machinery and equipment. During fiscal 2005, the majority of the
cash used in investing activities related to capital spending and costs associated with the
acquisition of Alaris and Geodax. The majority of the cash used in investing activities during
fiscal 2004 was related to costs associated with the acquisitions of Alaris, Intercare and Medicap.
During fiscal 2005, cash used in investing activities included approximately $99.8&nbsp;million related
to the purchase of investment securities available for sale. See Note 23 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements&#148; for information on the Company&#146;s
investments. Cash used in investing
activities during fiscal 2005 also includes cash proceeds of approximately $47.4&nbsp;million which the Company received
related to the sale of discontinued operations. See Note 22 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements&#148; for information on the Company&#146;s discontinued operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Financing activities.</U> The Company&#146;s financing activities utilized cash of $1,657.1
million, $815.7&nbsp;million and $712.3&nbsp;million during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash
used in financing activities during fiscal 2005 primarily reflects the Company&#146;s decisions to
retire its commercial paper and certain debt assumed in the Alaris acquisition and repurchase its
Common Shares as authorized by its Board of Directors (see &#147;Share Repurchases&#148; below for additional
information). During fiscal 2005, the Company utilized $500.3&nbsp;million to repurchase its Common
Shares. Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2004 and 2003 primarily reflects the
Company&#146;s decision to repurchase its shares as authorized by its Board of Directors. These cash
outflows for fiscal 2004 and 2003 were partially offset by net proceeds received from the Company&#146;s
debt facilities and proceeds received from shares issued under various employee stock plans.

million of cash held by its subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority
of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so subjects it to
United States federal income tax.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined that it will repatriate $500
million of accumulated foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of
the AJCA, and accordingly has recorded a related tax liability of $26.3&nbsp;million as of June&nbsp;30,
2005. The $500&nbsp;million is the maximum repatriation available to the Company under the repatriation
provisions of the AJCA. See Note 8 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; for additional

completed, several share repurchase programs. The Company repurchased approximately $3.2&nbsp;billion
of the Company&#146;s shares, in the aggregate, through these share repurchase programs. During fiscal
2005, the Company repurchased approximately 8.8&nbsp;million shares having an average price paid per
share of $56.76. During fiscal 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 24.2&nbsp;million shares
having an average price paid per share of $62.03. During fiscal 2003, the Company repurchased
approximately 19.6&nbsp;million shares having an average price paid per share of $60.77. The
repurchased shares were placed into treasury to be used for general corporate purposes. See

commercial note program and a committed receivables sales facility program with capacity to sell
$800&nbsp;million in receivables. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company did not have any outstanding
borrowings from the commercial paper program. The Company also has other short-term credit
facilities of approximately $322.7&nbsp;million, of which $136.0&nbsp;million was outstanding as of June&nbsp;30,

revolving credit facilities. The proceeds of this borrowing were utilized to repay a portion of
the Company&#146;s commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including the establishment of
pharmaceutical inventory at the Pharmaceutical Distribution business&#146; National Logistics Center in
Groveport, Ohio. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company borrowed an additional $750
million on the revolving credit facilities, with the proceeds utilized primarily for the
establishment of inventory at the National Logistics Center. The Company fully repaid the $1.25
billion in outstanding balances under its bank revolving credit facilities during the second
quarter of fiscal 2005 due to stabilization in its short-term liquidity requirements in light of,
among other things, the Company having substantially completed the initial establishment of
inventory at the National Logistics Center.

Also during fiscal 2005, the Company paid off $183.6&nbsp;million of the $195.3&nbsp;million Senior
subordinated notes due 2011 assumed as part of the Company&#146;s acquisition of Alaris in fiscal 2004.
The Company also amended the bond indenture to remove the restrictive covenants. The remaining
balance at June&nbsp;30, 2005 of $11.6&nbsp;million is callable at any time on or after July&nbsp;1, 2007. Also
related to the Alaris acquisition, the Company acquired a bank credit facility consisting of a
six-year $245&nbsp;million term loan and a five-year $30&nbsp;million revolving credit facility. At June&nbsp;30,
2004, $162.6&nbsp;million was outstanding under the term loan. During fiscal 2005, the Company paid off
the $162.6&nbsp;million balance under the term loan and terminated the credit facility.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to periodically sell trade
receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the &#147;Accounts Receivable
and Financing Entity&#148;), which is exclusively engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and
making loans to, the Company. The Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity, which is consolidated
by the Company as it is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity, issued $250
million and $400&nbsp;million in preferred variable debt securities to parties not affiliated with the
Company during fiscal 2004 and 2001, respectively. These preferred debt securities are classified
as long-term debt in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet. These preferred debt securities
must be retired or redeemed by the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity before the Company, or
its creditors, can have access to the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity&#146;s receivables.

expand its role as a leading provider of services to the health care industry. The Company
evaluates possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intends to take advantage of
opportunities to expand its role as a provider of services to the health care industry through all
its reporting segments. If additional transactions are entered into or consummated, the Company
may need to enter into funding arrangements for such mergers or acquisitions.

outlooks are &#147;negative,&#148; &#147;stable&#148; and &#147;negative,&#148; respectively. Although a ratings downgrade by
any of the rating agencies will not trigger an acceleration of any of the Company&#146;s indebtedness,
further reductions in the Company&#146;s credit ratings could negatively impact its ability to access
capital as well as its ability to issue additional debt securities at currently available interest

securities as discussed below, are free of any financial covenants other than minimum net worth
which cannot fall below $4.1&nbsp;billion at any time. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company was in
compliance with this covenant.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s preferred debt securities contain a minimum adjusted tangible net worth covenant
(adjusted tangible net worth cannot fall below $3.0&nbsp;billion) and certain financial ratio covenants.
As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. A breach of any of these
covenants would be followed by a grace period during which the Company may discuss remedies with
the security holders, or extinguish the securities, without causing an event of default.

estimated impact of its hedging program, which mitigates the Company&#146;s transactional exposure. At
June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, the Company had hedged approximately 52% of its transactional exposures.
The following table summarizes the analysis as it relates to the Company&#146;s transactional exposure:

operations. The nature and amount of the Company&#146;s long-term and short-term debt can be expected
to fluctuate as a result of business requirements, market conditions and other factors. The

Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc.:</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cardinal Health, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements
of earnings, shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
June&nbsp;30, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item&nbsp;15(a)(2). These consolidated financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and the schedule based on our audits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2005, in conformity with the U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its
method of recognizing cash discounts effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2004.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting

Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
following is a summary of the previously reported governmental and internal
investigations regarding Cardinal Health, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) and related matters. This summary
updates the information provided in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June&nbsp;30, 2004 (the &#147;2004 Form 10-K&#148;) and in its Quarterly Reports for fiscal 2005. The 2004
Form 10-K reflected certain conclusions reached by the Company&#146;s
Audit Committee and restated and reclassified the
Company&#146;s consolidated  financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of
fiscal 2004. As discussed more fully below and as previously reported, settlement discussions
have recently commenced with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) regarding
resolution of its investigation with respect to the Company, and the Company has recorded a reserve
of $25&nbsp;million for fiscal 2005 in respect of the SEC investigation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
previously
reported, in October&nbsp;2003, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry regarding the Company. The SEC&#146;s
initial request sought historical financial and related information including but not limited to
the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. In connection with the
SEC&#146;s informal inquiry, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company commenced its
own internal review in April&nbsp;2004, assisted by independent counsel. On May&nbsp;6, 2004, the Company
was notified that the SEC had converted the informal inquiry into a formal investigation. On June
21, 2004, as part of the SEC&#146;s formal investigation, the Company received an additional SEC
subpoena that included a request for the production of documents relating to revenue
classification, and the methods used for such classification, in the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical
Distribution business as either &#147;Operating Revenue&#148; or &#147;Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and
Other.&#148; In addition, the Company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New
York had also commenced an inquiry with respect to the Company that the Company understands relates
to the revenue classification issue. On October&nbsp;12, 2004, in connection with the SEC&#146;s formal
investigation, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting the production of documents
relating to compensation information for specific current and former employees and officers. The
Company was notified in April&nbsp;2005 that certain current and former employees and directors received
subpoenas from the SEC requesting the production of documents. The subject matter of these
requests is consistent with the subject matter of the subpoenas the Company had previously received
from the SEC. The Company continues to respond to the SEC&#146;s investigation and the Audit
Committee&#146;s internal review and provide all information required.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During September and October&nbsp;2004, the Audit Committee reached certain conclusions with
respect to findings from its internal review. These conclusions regarding certain items that
impact revenue and earnings related to four primary areas of focus: (1)&nbsp;classification of sales to
customer warehouses between &#147;Operating Revenue&#148; and &#147;Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and
Other&#148; within the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment; (2)
disclosure of the Company&#146;s practice, in certain reporting periods, of accelerating its receipt and
recognition of cash discounts earned from suppliers for prompt payment; (3)&nbsp;timing of revenue
recognition within the Company&#146;s former Automation and Information Services segment; and (4)
certain balance sheet reserve and accrual adjustments that had been identified in the internal
review. In connection with these conclusions, the Audit Committee determined that the consolidated
financial statements of the Company with respect to fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, as well as
the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, should be restated to reflect the conclusions from its
internal review to date. These restatements were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the conclusions reached by the Audit Committee in September and October&nbsp;2004, the
Audit Committee began the task of assigning responsibility for the financial statement matters
described above which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K and in January&nbsp;2005 took disciplinary
actions with respect to the Company&#146;s employees who it determined bore responsibility for these
matters, other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for which there is a separate Board committee internal review (discussed below). The
disciplinary actions ranged from terminations or resignations of employment to required repayments
of some or all of fiscal 2003 bonuses from certain employees to letters of reprimand. These
disciplinary actions affected senior financial and managerial personnel, as well as other
personnel, at the corporate level and in the four business segments. None of the Company&#146;s current
corporate executive officers (who are identified under the heading &#147;Executive Officers of the
Company&#148; following Item&nbsp;4 of the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
June&nbsp;30, 2005) were the subject of disciplinary action by the Audit Committee. In connection with
the determinations made by the Audit Committee, the Company&#146;s
former controller resigned effective
February&nbsp;15, 2005. The Audit Committee has completed its determinations of responsibility for the
financial statement matters described above which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K, although
responsibility for matters relating to the Company&#146;s accounting treatment of certain recoveries
from vitamin manufacturers has been addressed by a separate committee of the Board. The Audit
Committee internal review is substantially complete.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">counsel,
separately initiated an internal review to assign responsibility for matters
relating to the Company&#146;s accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. In the 2004 Form 10-K, as part of the Audit Committee&#146;s
internal review, the Company reversed its previous recognition of estimated recoveries from vitamin
manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years and recognized the income from such recoveries
as a special item in the period in which cash was received from the manufacturers. The SEC staff
had previously advised the Company that, in its view, the Company did not have an appropriate basis
for recognizing the income in advance of receiving the cash. In August&nbsp;2005, the separate Board
committee reached certain conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review and
determined that no additional disciplinary actions were required
beyond the disciplinary actions already taken by the Audit Committee,
as described above. The separate Board committee
internal review is substantially complete.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlement discussions have recently commenced with the SEC regarding resolution of
its investigation with respect to the Company. While these discussions are ongoing, there can be
no assurance that the Company&#146;s efforts to resolve the investigation with respect to the Company
will be successful, and the Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of these matters or the
terms of any such resolution. As a result of the initiation of these discussions, the Company
recorded a reserve of $25&nbsp;million for its fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2005 in respect of the SEC
investigation. Unless and until the SEC investigation is resolved, there can be no assurance that
the amount reserved by the Company for this investigation will be sufficient and that a larger
amount will not be required. Therefore, this reserve will be reviewed on a quarterly basis and
adjusted to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusions of the Audit Committee&#146;s internal review with respect to financial statement
matters were set forth in Notes 1 and 2 of &#147;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#148;
included in the 2004 Form 10-K. More information with respect to the
prior conclusions of the Audit Committee&#146;s
internal review and the impact of the reclassification and
restatement adjustments on the reporting periods
discussed in this Form 10-K is set forth below.

&#147;Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other&#148; Within the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution
and Provider Services Segment</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As presented historically since 1998, the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services
segment&#146;s revenue was classified into two categories (&#147;Operating Revenue&#148; and &#147;Bulk Deliveries to
Customer Warehouses and Other&#148;). The &#147;Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other&#148; category
had historically included revenue arising from sales where the Company ordered pharmaceutical
product in bulk on behalf of a specific warehousing customer and
either the manufacturer shipped the
product directly to the customer&#146;s warehouse or the product was shipped to the customer&#146;s warehouse
by the Company shortly after it was received by the Company and was not put into the Company&#146;s
inventory (in either case, &#147;Bulk Revenue&#148;). For all Bulk Revenue, the product was shipped to the
customer in the same bulk form in which it was received by the Company from the manufacturers.
From November&nbsp;2001 through March&nbsp;2004, the Company followed an internal policy for distinguishing
between Operating Revenue and Bulk Revenue based on how long the product was in the Company&#146;s
possession prior to being shipped to customers. If the product was in the possession of the
Company for more than 24 hours prior to being shipped to customers, then, regardless of other
characteristics of the transaction or the reason for the product being held more than 24 hours, the
sale of that product was deemed to be Operating Revenue. The Company&#146;s internal policy also
provided that customer orders for bulk shipments filled from inventory within the Company&#146;s
warehouse were deemed to be Operating Revenue. Based on results of the internal review conducted
by the Audit Committee, the Company concluded that certain bulk shipments ordered by customers were
intentionally held beyond 24 hours so that, pursuant to the internal policy, such shipments were
classified as Operating Revenue in four quarters within fiscal 2003 and 2002. The impact of this
practice was not previously quantified and disclosed as part of the Company&#146;s reported Operating
Revenue. The improper classification between Bulk Revenue and Operating Revenue had no impact on
the Company&#146;s previously reported total revenue or operating or net earnings for these periods.
See Note 2 for further discussion of these matters.

of Accelerating Its Receipt and Recognition of Cash Discounts Earned From Suppliers for Prompt
Payment</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, the Company recognized cash discounts as a reduction of cost of products sold
primarily upon payment of vendor invoices. Cash discounts are discounts the Company receives from
some vendors for timely payment of invoices. The Company had a practice of accelerating payment of
vendor invoices at the end of certain reporting periods in order to accelerate the recognition of
cash discounts, which had the effect of improving operating results for those reporting periods.
Although the effect of these accelerated payments were properly included in the Company&#146;s reported
earnings, the impact of this acceleration practice was not separately quantified and disclosed in
the periods in which the Company benefited from this practice. The net increase/(decrease) in net
earnings as a result of this practice for fiscal 2004 and 2003 is as follows:

above table includes corrections from the amounts reported in the
2004 Form 10-K based on additional information. The net impact of
these corrections resulted in an increase/(decrease) of $0.3 million,

respectively.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fourth quarter fiscal 2004, the Company changed its accounting method for
recognizing cash discounts from recognition primarily upon payment of vendor invoices to recording
cash discounts as a component of inventory cost and recognizing such discounts as a reduction to
cost of products sold upon sale by the Company of the purchased inventory. The Company believes
the change in accounting method provides a more objectively determinable method of recognizing cash
discounts and a better matching of inventory cost to revenue. This change was retroactively
effective to the beginning of fiscal 2004. As a result, the Company restated its previously
reported fiscal 2004 quarterly results to reflect this change. See Note 16 below for further
discussion of this change in accounting.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within its former Automation and Information Services segment (which is now included in the
Clinical Technologies and Services segment; see Note 18 below), the Company&#146;s revenue recognition
policy for equipment systems installed at a customer&#146;s site is to recognize revenue once the
Company&#146;s installation obligations are complete and the equipment is functioning according to the
material specifications of the user&#146;s manual and the customer has accepted the equipment as
evidenced by signing an equipment confirmation document. As described in the 2004 Form 10-K, the
Company learned of concerns during the Audit Committee&#146;s internal review that some equipment
confirmation documents were being executed prior to the time when installations were complete and
revenue could be recognized. In order to assess the implications of any premature execution of
equipment confirmations and corresponding revenue recognition, the Audit Committee review included
the following:

reported revenue. As a result, it was determined that approximately 10.8% of revenue in the last
10&nbsp;days of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was being recognized prematurely (based upon an
extrapolation). The Company recorded an $8.3&nbsp;million reduction of revenue and a $5.3&nbsp;million
reduction of operating earnings during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to adjust for premature
revenue recognition that was determined to have occurred within that
quarter. This revenue and
operating earnings were recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 upon completion of the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using different estimation methods than the methodology used to derive the table above, the
percentage change in operating earnings for the periods noted above would range from less than 1%
to a high of 6.6%. There were two quarters in which the estimated impact was over 5% (first
quarter of fiscal 2003 negative impact of 6.6% and third quarter of fiscal 2004 negative impact of
5.5%). The Company believes that the impact of the adjustments resulting from the estimation
methods are not material to previously reported results because such estimated adjustments do not
distort trends in revenue and operating earnings growth that were previously reported and would not
alter the Company&#146;s previous disclosures related to the former Automation and Information Services
segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the premature revenue recognition practices identified at June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company
completed a similar review of the installation process during the first quarter of fiscal 2005,
including interviews with selected customers representing a substantial percentage of the former
Automation and Information Services segment&#146;s end of quarter reported revenue. While the results
from the interviews performed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 suggested a lower incidence of
premature revenue recognition than at June&nbsp;30, 2004, the sample of customers interviewed was more
limited than was completed at June&nbsp;30, 2004. In addition, the Company&#146;s efforts to improve its
system of internal controls were in the early stages. As a result, the Company in conjunction with
the Audit Committee decided to adjust reported revenue utilizing the same error rate, 10.8%, as was
utilized at June&nbsp;30, 2004. Utilizing the same 10.8% assumed error rate, the Company recorded a
$4.2&nbsp;million reduction in revenue and a $2.5&nbsp;million reduction in operating earnings during the
first quarter of fiscal 2005. This adjustment is exclusive of the recognition of the $8.3&nbsp;million
in revenue and $5.3&nbsp;million of operating earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 described
above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the completion of the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company reiterated the
revenue recognition policy for equipment systems installed at a customer&#146;s site for its former
Automation and Information Services segment, and instructed all employees to strictly adhere to
this policy. The Company continues to implement corrective actions in response to these findings
regarding its revenue recognition practices within its former Automation and Information Services
segment, as described in Note 1 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; in the 2004 Form
10-K. During the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005, the Company&#146;s internal audit
function completed a review of revenue recognition practices associated with the equipment
installation process for its former Automation and Information Services segment, including
interviews with selected customers and site visits to related customer locations representing a
substantial percentage of the former Automation and Information Services segment&#146;s end of quarter
reported revenue. The results of the interviews and site visits performed by the internal audit
function during the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005 did not indicate any
additional occurrences of premature revenue recognition as described above.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee&#146;s internal review included a review to determine if period-end adjustments
to balance sheet reserve accounts and other accruals recorded in fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2004
were properly recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). Based
upon the Audit Committee&#146;s internal review, the Company determined that there were various
situations where (a)&nbsp;the amount of reserve, (b)&nbsp;the timing of reserve recognition, or (c)&nbsp;the
timing of reserve adjustments could not be substantiated or was in error. As a result, as described in the 2004 Form 10-K, the consolidated financial
statements for certain prior fiscal quarters and years were restated by the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
types of balance sheet reserves and accrual adjustments that were
previously restated consist of the
following:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 3%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">1. Errors arising from misapplication of GAAP. These errors primarily include (a)&nbsp;reductions in
reserve accounts made in periods subsequent to the period in which the excess had been
identified by the Company, (b)&nbsp;a last-in, first-out (&#147;LIFO&#148;) inventory adjustment, and (c)&nbsp;a
change in accounting policy for dividends to recognition when declared versus when paid. The
net impact of these errors on the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is
reflected in the table below.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 3%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">2. Errors made in previous periods which were identified and appropriately corrected in a
subsequent period when discovered. These items were not reported as prior period corrections at
the time of their discovery because they were deemed immaterial. However, the
Company restated its prior consolidated financial statements to correct for such items
identified during the internal review. The net impact of these errors on the first three
quarters of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is reflected in the table below.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table summarizes the restatement impact on previously reported net earnings as
defined above for fiscal 2004 and 2003:

Period Errors</I></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Company continued to respond to the SEC&#146;s investigation and the Audit Committee&#146;s internal
review, the Company identified errors in certain restatement adjustments reflected in the 2004 Form
10-K. The impact of the individual and consolidated adjustments on operating earnings, net
earnings and the related per share amounts was immaterial for all periods presented. The tables
above have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of these errors. Had the tables been adjusted,
the total restatements would have increased/(decreased)&nbsp;by $0.1&nbsp;million, $(0.6) million, $0.8
million and $(0.5) million for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003,
respectively. Net earnings would have increased/(decreased), as a result of these errors for
fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 by $(0.2) million, $(0.5) million and $2.8&nbsp;million, respectively.
There was no impact on the previously reported earnings per share for any of the periods effected.
In addition, the above errors would also decrease the Company&#146;s June&nbsp;30, 2000 retained earnings by
$1.1&nbsp;million.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As presented historically since 1998, the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services
segment&#146;s revenue was classified into two categories (&#147;Operating Revenue&#148; and &#147;Bulk Deliveries to
Customer Warehouses and Other&#148;). The &#147;Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other&#148; category
had historically included revenue arising from sales where the Company ordered pharmaceutical
product in bulk on behalf of a specific warehousing customer and
either the manufacturer shipped the
product directly to the customer&#146;s warehouse or the product was shipped to the customer&#146;s warehouse
by the Company shortly after it was received by the Company and was not put into the Company&#146;s
inventory (in either case, &#147;Bulk Revenue&#148;). For all Bulk Revenue, the product was shipped to the
customer in the same bulk form in which it was received by the Company from the manufacturers.
From November&nbsp;2001 through March&nbsp;2004, the Company followed an internal policy for distinguishing
between Operating Revenue and Bulk Revenue based on how long the product was in the Company&#146;s
possession prior to being shipped to customers. If the product was in the possession of the
Company for more than 24 hours prior to being shipped to customers, then, regardless of other
characteristics of the transaction or the reason for the product being held more than 24 hours, the
sale of that product was deemed to be Operating Revenue. The Company&#146;s internal policy also
provided that customer orders for bulk shipments filled from inventory within the Company&#146;s
warehouse were deemed to be Operating Revenue. Based on results of the internal review conducted
by the Audit Committee, the Company concluded that certain bulk shipments ordered by customers were
intentionally held beyond 24 hours so that, pursuant to the internal policy, such shipments were
classified as Operating Revenue in two quarters within fiscal 2003. The impact of this practice
was not previously quantified and disclosed as part of the Company&#146;s reported Operating Revenue.
The improper classification between Bulk Revenue and Operating Revenue had no impact on the
Company&#146;s previously reported total revenue or operating or net earnings for these periods.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table shows the amount of Bulk Revenue that was estimated to be improperly
classified as Operating Revenue in the manner described above and the impact from adjusting each of
Bulk Revenue and Operating Revenue for the periods in which these improper classifications
occurred:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company decided to aggregate revenue classes within its 2004 Form 10-K. &#147;Operating
Revenue&#148; and &#147;Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other&#148; have been combined for all periods
presented so that total revenue and total cost of products sold are presented as single amounts in
the consolidated statements of earnings. These reclassifications have no effect on previously
reported total revenue, related cost of products sold, operating earnings, net earnings or earnings
per share. Beginning with the 2004 Form 10-K, information concerning the portion of the Company&#146;s
revenue that arises from Bulk Revenue is discussed in the Company&#146;s &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain other insignificant reclassifications were made to conform prior period amounts to the
current presentation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company is a leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry
and helping health care providers and manufacturers improve the efficiency and quality of health
care. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company conducted its business within the following four business
segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services; Medical Products and Services;
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services; and Clinical Technologies and Services. See Note 18 for
information related to the Company&#146;s business segments.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Basis of Presentation. </B>The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of all majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, all significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company completed several acquisitions that were
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The consolidated financial statements
include the results of operations from each of these business combinations as of the date of
acquisition. Additional disclosure related to the Company&#146;s acquisitions is provided in Note 4.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include, but are not limited to,
inventory valuation, allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill and intangible asset impairment,
vendor reserves and restructuring charge reserves. Actual amounts may differ from these estimated
amounts.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Cash Equivalents. </B>The Company considers all liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these cash equivalents approximates
fair value. Cash payments for interest were $127.4&nbsp;million, $112.7&nbsp;million and $115.3&nbsp;million and
cash payments for income taxes were $535.8&nbsp;million, $566.3&nbsp;million and $256.8&nbsp;million for fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 4 for additional information regarding non-cash
investing activities related to certain recent acquisitions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Short-term Investments. </B>The Company&#146;s short-term investments include approximately $79.8&nbsp;million
in tax-exempt variable demand notes and approximately $20.0&nbsp;million in tax-exempt auction rate
securities. These short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale on the Company&#146;s
consolidated balance sheet. The Company&#146;s investments in these securities are recorded at cost,
which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates. See Note 23 for
additional information regarding short-term investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Receivables. </B>Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the Company through its
pharmaceutical and other health care service activities and are presented net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts of $109.8&nbsp;million and $119.1 million at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. An
account is considered past due on the first day after its due date. In accordance with contract
terms, the Company generally has the ability to charge a customer service fees or higher prices if
an account is considered past due. The Company continuously monitors past due accounts and
establishes appropriate reserves to cover potential losses. The Company will write-off any amounts
deemed uncollectible against an established bad debt reserve.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company provides financing to various customers. Such financing arrangements range from
one year to ten years, at interest rates that generally are subject to fluctuation. Interest
income on these accounts is recognized by the Company as it is earned. The financings may be
collateralized, guaranteed by third parties or unsecured. Finance notes and accrued interest
receivables were $57.5&nbsp;million and $35.4&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, respectively (current
portions were $40.5&nbsp;million and $17.2&nbsp;million, respectively), and are included in other assets.
These amounts are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.4&nbsp;million and $4.1
million at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has formed special purpose entities with the sole purpose of buying receivables or
sales-type leases from various legal entities of the Company and selling those receivables or
sales-type leases to certain multi-seller conduits administered by banks or other third-party
investors. See Note 10 for additional disclosure regarding off-balance sheet financing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to periodically sell trade
receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the &#147;Accounts Receivable
and Financing Entity&#148;) which is exclusively engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and
making loans to, the Company. The Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity, which is consolidated
by the Company, issued $250&nbsp;million and $400&nbsp;million in preferred variable debt securities to
parties not affiliated with the Company

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">during fiscal 2004 and 2001, respectively.
These preferred debt securities must be retired or
redeemed by the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity before the Company, or its creditors, can
have access to the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity&#146;s receivables. See Note 6 for
additional information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Inventories.
</B>A substantial portion of inventories (approximately 67% in 2005 and 66% in
2004) are stated at the lower of cost, using the LIFO method, or
market. These inventories are included within the Company&#146;s
Pharmaceutical Distribution business and are
primarily merchandise inventories. The remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of
cost, using the first-in, first-out (&#147;FIFO&#148;) method, or market. If the Company had used the FIFO
method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have
been higher than the LIFO method reported at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004 by $26.0&nbsp;million and $57.8
million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Goodwill and Other Intangibles. </B>The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and other intangible
assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;142,
&#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#148; Under SFAS No.&nbsp;142, purchased goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at
least annually. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships and patents
and trademarks, continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company performed its annual
impairment test in fiscal 2005 and 2004, neither of which resulted in the recognition of any
impairment charges. See Note 17 for additional disclosure regarding goodwill and other intangible
assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Property and Equipment. </B>Property and equipment are primarily stated at cost. Depreciation expense
for financial reporting purposes is primarily computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, including capital lease assets which are depreciated over the
terms of their respective leases. The Company uses the following range of useful lives for its
property and equipment categories: buildings and improvements &#150; 1 to 50&nbsp;years; machinery and
equipment &#150; 3 to 20&nbsp;years; furniture and fixtures &#150; 7&nbsp;years. Depreciation expense was $337.8
million, $278.0&nbsp;million and $249.0&nbsp;million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
Company expenses repairs and maintenance expenditures as incurred. The Company capitalizes
interest on long-term fixed asset projects using a rate of 5.0%, which approximates the Company&#146;s
weighted average interest rate on long-term debt. The amount of capitalized interest within the
Corporate entity was immaterial for all fiscal years presented.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Other Accrued Liabilities. </B>Other accrued liabilities represent various obligations of the Company
including certain accrued operating expenses and taxes payable. For the fiscal years ended June
30, 2005 and 2004, the largest component of other accrued liabilities was deferred tax liabilities
of approximately $730.8&nbsp;million and $530.2&nbsp;million, respectively. Other significant components of
other accrued liabilities were current taxes payable and employee compensation and related benefit
accruals. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, current taxes payable were $209.8&nbsp;million and $286.4&nbsp;million,
respectively, while employee compensation and related benefit accruals were $381.3&nbsp;million and
$310.8&nbsp;million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Revenue Recognition. </B>In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (&#147;SAB&#148;) No.&nbsp;104, &#147;Revenue
Recognition,&#148; the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
product delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the price is fixed or

of revenue and cost of sales for the sales price and cost, respectively, when products are
returned. The Pharmaceutical Distribution business&#146; customer return policy requires that the
product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees, and only allows customers to return
products which can be added back to inventory and resold at full value, or which can be returned to
vendors for credit. Product returns are generally consistent throughout the year, and typically
are not specific to any particular product or customer. Amounts recorded in revenue and cost of
sales under this accounting policy closely approximate what would have been recorded under SFAS No.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Interest Rate and Currency Risk Management. </B>The Company accounts for derivative instruments in
accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;133, as amended, &#147;Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activity.&#148; Under
this standard, all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and all
changes in fair value are recorded to net earnings or shareholders&#146; equity through other
comprehensive income.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company uses forward currency exchange contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps
to manage its exposures to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange
rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs and to the interest rate changes on
borrowing costs. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also uses interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the value of fixed rate debt due
to variations in interest rates. Both the derivative instruments and underlying debt are adjusted
to market value through &#147;interest expense and other&#148; at the end of each period. The Company uses
foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and
liabilities. The remeasurement adjustments for any foreign currency denominated assets or
liabilities are included in &#147;interest expense and other.&#148; The remeasurement adjustment is offset
by the foreign currency forward contract settlements which are also classified in &#147;interest expense
and other <I>.</I>&#148; Both interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are
designated as fair value hedges.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company generally does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
During fiscal 2003, the Company entered into one speculative interest rate swap transaction
resulting in a gain of approximately $6.7&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s derivative contracts are adjusted to current market values each period and
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No.&nbsp;133, as amended. Periodic gains and losses of
contracts designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in other comprehensive income until the
underlying transactions are recognized. Upon recognition, such gains and losses are recorded in
net earnings as an adjustment to the carrying amounts of underlying transactions in the period in
which these transactions are recognized. For those contracts designated as fair value hedges,
resulting gains or losses are recognized in net earnings offsetting the exposures of underlying
transactions. Carrying values of all contracts are included in other assets or liabilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s policy requires contracts used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk
associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the
contract. Hedging effectiveness is assessed periodically. Any contract not designated as a hedge,
or so designated but ineffective, is adjusted to market value and recognized in net earnings
immediately. If a fair value or cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting or is
terminated, the contract would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until
settled and future adjustments to the contract&#146;s fair value would be recognized in earnings
immediately. If a forecasted transaction were no longer probable to occur, amounts previously
deferred in other comprehensive income would be recognized immediately in earnings. Additional
disclosure related to the Company&#146;s hedging contracts is provided in Note 7.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Research and Development Costs. </B>Costs incurred in connection with development of new products and
manufacturing methods are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development expenses were
$117.2&nbsp;million, $56.5&nbsp;million and $56.9&nbsp;million in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
increase in fiscal 2005 primarily relates to incremental expenses
from the acquisition of Alaris. The Company received reimbursement
for certain research and development costs. The reimbursements were
immaterial for all periods presented.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Income Taxes. </B>In accordance with provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for Income
Taxes,&#148; the Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and
liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future
tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial
reporting bases of the Company&#146;s assets and liabilities. Historically, no provision was made for
U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because those earnings are
considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined that it will repatriate $500&nbsp;million of accumulated
foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;). Accordingly, the Company has recorded a related tax liability
of $26.3&nbsp;million as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. The $500&nbsp;million is the maximum repatriation available to
the Company under the repatriation provisions of the AJCA. See Note 8 of &#147;Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements&#148; for additional information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Earnings per Common Share. </B>Basic earnings per Common Share (&#147;Basic&#148;) is computed by dividing net
earnings (the numerator) by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding during each
period (the denominator). Diluted earnings per Common Share is similar to the computation for
Basic, except that the denominator is increased by the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted
shares and restricted share units computed using the treasury stock method.

the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.&#148; This FASB Staff
Position provides guidance on the accounting, disclosure, effective date and transition
requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
FASB Staff Position SFAS 106-2 is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June&nbsp;15,
2004. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial
position or results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;151, &#147;Inventory Costs-an amendment of Accounting
Research Bulletin (&#147;ARB&#148;) No.&nbsp;43, Chapter&nbsp;4.&#148; The Statement requires abnormal amounts of idle
capacity and spoilage costs be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred.
SFAS No.&nbsp;151 is applicable to inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June&nbsp;15,
2005. The adoption of this Statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s
financial position or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;153, &#147;Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets-an amendment
of Accounting Principles Board (&#147;APB&#148;) Opinion No.&nbsp;29.&#148; This Statement requires exchanges of
productive assets to be accounted for at fair value, rather than at carryover basis, unless: (a)
neither the asset received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within
reasonable limits; or (b)&nbsp;the transactions lack commercial substance. SFAS No.&nbsp;153 is effective
for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June&nbsp;15, 2005. The
adoption of this Statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial
position or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS 109-1, &#147;Application of FASB
Statement No.&nbsp;109, Accounting for Income Taxes, for the Tax Deduction Provided to U.S.-Based
Manufacturers by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.&#148; This FASB Staff Position clarifies that
the tax deduction for domestic manufacturers under the AJCA should be accounted for as a special
deduction in accordance with FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes.&#148; FASB Staff
Position SFAS 109-1 was effective upon issuance. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a
material impact on the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS 109-2, &#147;Accounting and Disclosure
Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004.&#148; This pronouncement provides entities more time to evaluate the impact of the AJCA on the
entity&#146;s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying
SFAS No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes.&#148; FASB Staff Position SFAS 109-2 was effective upon
issuance. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined that it will repatriate

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R), &#147;Share-Based Payment,&#148; which revises SFAS
No.&nbsp;123, &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.&#148; SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No.&nbsp;25,
&#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,&#148; and amends SFAS No.&nbsp;95, &#147;Statement of Cash Flows.&#148;
This Statement requires that a public entity measure the cost of equity-based service awards based
on the grant date fair value of the award. All share-based payments to employees, including grants
of employee stock options, are required to be recognized in the income statement based on their
fair value. SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) is effective for the Company as of the beginning of the first annual
reporting period after June&nbsp;15, 2005. The Company will adopt this Statement on July&nbsp;1, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) allows public companies to adopt its requirement using one of the following
transition methods: (a)&nbsp;a &#147;modified prospective&#148; method in which compensation cost for all
share-based payments granted after the effective date is recognized based on the requirements of
SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective
date that are unvested as of the effective date of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) is recognized based on SFAS No.
123; or (b)&nbsp;a &#147;modified retrospective&#148; method which includes the requirements of the modified
prospective method and also permits entities to restate prior periods presented or prior interim
periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized in its SFAS No.&nbsp;123 pro
forma disclosures. The Company will be adopting SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) using the modified prospective
method.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using the intrinsic
value method under APB Opinion No.&nbsp;25. As such, the Company generally does not recognize
compensation cost for stock options granted to employees. The adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) is
expected to have a significant impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations; however, it is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s overall financial position. The Company cannot
determine the impact of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) at this time as it will depend on share-based payments
granted in the future. However, if the Company had adopted SFAS No.123(R) in prior periods, the
impact would have approximated the impact of SFAS No.&nbsp;123 as described below in the &#147;Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation&#148; disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share. SFAS
No.123(R) also requires the benefits of excess tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as is currently
required. As such, in the periods after adoption, this requirement of SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R) will reduce
net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flow. The Company cannot estimate what
the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on, among other items, future employee stock
option exercises. However, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in the year ended June
30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 for such excess tax deductions were $18.8&nbsp;million, $66.4&nbsp;million and $65.5
million, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;47, &#147;Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations.&#148; This Interpretation clarifies the term of conditional asset retirement
obligations as used in SFAS No.&nbsp;143, &#147;Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.&#148; This
Interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December&nbsp;15, 2005.
The adoption of this Interpretation is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s
financial position or results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;154, &#147;Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.&#148; SFAS
No.&nbsp;154 is a replacement of APB Opinion No.&nbsp;20, &#147;Accounting Changes&#148; and SFAS No.&nbsp;3, &#147;Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.&#148; This Statement requires voluntary changes in
accounting to be accounted for retrospectively and all prior periods to be restated as if the newly
adopted policy had always been used, unless it is impracticable. APB Opinion No.&nbsp;20 previously
required most voluntary changes in accounting to be recognized by including the cumulative effect
of the change in accounting in net income in the period of change. This Statement also requires a
change in method of depreciation, amortization or depletion for a long-lived asset be accounted for
as a change in estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No.&nbsp;154 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2005. Once adopted by the Company, this
Statement could have an impact on prior year consolidated financial statements if the Company has a
change in accounting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. </B>At June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company maintained several stock
incentive plans for the benefit of certain employees. The Company accounts for these plans in
accordance with APB No.&nbsp;25, and related interpretations. Except for costs related to restricted
shares, restricted share units, stock appreciation rights and an insignificant number of amended options requiring a new
measurement date, no compensation expense has been recognized in net earnings, as all options
granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of
grant. The following tables illustrate the effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the
Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;123, &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation&#148;:

purchase price of these individually immaterial acquisitions, which was paid in cash, was
approximately $107&nbsp;million. Assumed liabilities of acquired businesses were approximately $27

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Fiscal 2004. </I>On June&nbsp;28, 2004, the Company acquired approximately 98.7% of the outstanding
common stock of Alaris, a San Diego, California-based provider of intravenous medication safety
products and services. On July&nbsp;7, 2004, Alaris merged with a subsidiary of the Company to complete
the transaction. This acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The
cash transaction was valued at approximately $2.1&nbsp;billion, including the assumption of
approximately $358&nbsp;million of debt. Under the agreement, the Company agreed to make a cash tender
offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Alaris common stock at a price of $22.35 per
share. Alaris employees with outstanding stock options either elected to receive a cash payment or
convert their options into an option to purchase the Company&#146;s Common Shares. In July&nbsp;2004,
certain Alaris employees elected to convert their options for the right to purchase a total of
approximately 0.6&nbsp;million Common Shares of the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allocation of the Alaris purchase price resulted in an allocation to goodwill of
approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion and an allocation to identifiable intangible assets of $413.2&nbsp;million.
The Company valued intangible assets related to trademarks, trade names, patents and customer
relationships. The detail by category is as follows:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the completion of the Alaris acquisition, on June&nbsp;16, 2004, ICU Medical, Inc. filed a
patent infringement lawsuit against Alaris in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California. In the lawsuit, ICU claims that the Alaris SmartSite<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> family of
needle-free valves and systems infringes upon ICU patents. ICU seeks monetary damages plus
permanent injunctive relief preventing Alaris from selling SmartSite<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP> products. On July
30, 2004, the Court denied ICU&#146;s application for a preliminary injunction finding, among other
things, that ICU had failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. The Company
intends to vigorously defend this action.

approximately 12.5&nbsp;million Common Shares, valued at approximately $780&nbsp;million, to Syncor
stockholders and Syncor&#146;s outstanding stock options were converted into options to purchase
approximately 3.0&nbsp;million Common Shares. The Company also assumed approximately $120&nbsp;million in
debt. In connection with this acquisition, certain operations of Syncor have been sold (see Note
22 below) and other operations have been integrated with the Company&#146;s existing Nuclear Pharmacy
Services business, a component of the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company incurred costs of $118.9&nbsp;million related to restructuring projects associated with
Phase I initiated within the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment during fiscal 2005.
The projects within this segment include planned reductions of headcount within existing operations
and consolidation of overlapping operations. The total costs for fiscal 2005 include $102.7
million of asset impairment charges of which approximately $102.4&nbsp;million related to its plan to
sell three facilities and transfer business from a fourth facility. The Company plans to sell a
portion of the businesses housed in each of the three facilities available for sale and transfer
the remaining portion of the businesses to other existing Company facilities. One facility was
sold in fiscal 2005 and the Company expects to complete the sale of the remaining two facilities no
later than the end of fiscal 2006. The carrying amount of the three facilities to be sold was
$106.3&nbsp;million, which included $18.7&nbsp;million of goodwill allocated in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;142,
&#147;Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.&#148; As the Company determined that the plan of sale criteria
in SFAS No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,&#148; had been met
during fiscal 2005, the carrying value of the asset groups being sold was adjusted to $28.5
million, the estimated fair market values less costs to sell. As a result, the Company recognized
asset impairment charges of $77.8&nbsp;million associated with the three businesses during fiscal 2005.
As stated above, the Company also committed to a plan to transfer production from a fourth facility
within its Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services facilities to another existing Company facility
in fiscal 2005. Production is expected to continue at the facility through fiscal 2007. The
Company recorded an asset impairment of $24.6&nbsp;million in fiscal 2005 based on an analysis of
discounted cash flows in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company incurred costs of $0.7&nbsp;million related to a restructuring project associated with
Phase I initiated within the Clinical Technologies and Services segment during fiscal 2005. The
costs were incurred in connection with a planned headcount reduction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2005, the Company incurred costs of $30.0&nbsp;million related to restructuring
projects associated with Phase I and Phase II that impacted multiple segments. These costs related
primarily to project consulting fees incurred as a result of design and implementation of the
Company&#146;s overall restructuring plan, restructuring the Company&#146;s delivery of information
technology infrastructure services, and severance accrued upon management&#146;s commitment to the
restructuring plan when a defined severance plan exists.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Other Restructuring Programs.</U> Separate from the global restructuring program
discussed above, the Company incurred costs of $16.9&nbsp;million in fiscal 2005 to restructure
operations (both domestically and internationally) throughout the Company as compared to $37.1
million in fiscal 2004 and $67.0&nbsp;million in fiscal 2003. See costs by segment in the table above.
The restructuring plans across all segments focused on various aspects of operations, including
closing and consolidating certain manufacturing operations, rationalizing headcount both
domestically and internationally, and aligning operations in the most strategic and cost-efficient
structure. Included in these costs for fiscal 2004 were $13.7&nbsp;million in asset impairments related
to the Company&#146;s decision to exit certain North American commodity operations within the
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with implementing these restructuring plans, the Company incurred costs that
included, but were not limited to, the following: (a)&nbsp;employee-related costs, the majority of which
represents severance accrued upon either communication of terms to employees or management&#146;s
commitment to the restructuring plan when a defined severance plan exists; and (b)&nbsp;exit costs,
including asset impairment charges, costs incurred to relocate physical assets and project
management costs. The earliest of these restructuring plans was initiated during fiscal 2001, with
others being implemented throughout fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004. Some of these restructuring plans
were completed during fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005 while other plans will be completed throughout
fiscal 2006. Overall, the restructuring plans within the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider
Services segment resulted in the termination of approximately 43 employees, 41 of whom were
terminated as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. The restructuring plans within the Medical Products and Services
segment will result in the termination of approximately 2,200 employees, of whom approximately
2,185 had been terminated as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. The restructuring plans within the Pharmaceutical
Technologies and Services segment overall will result in the termination of approximately 1,100
employees, 1,050 of whom were terminated as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. The restructuring plans within the
Clinical Technologies and Services segment resulted in the termination of 35 employees, all of whom
had been terminated as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. The restructuring plans that impacted multiple segments
resulted in the termination of 20 employees, all of whom had been terminated as of June&nbsp;30, 2005.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs of integrating operations of various merged companies are recorded as merger-related
costs when incurred. The merger-related costs incurred during fiscal 2005 were primarily a result
of the Alaris and Syncor acquisitions. The merger-related costs incurred during fiscal 2004 were
primarily a result of the Syncor acquisition. Merger-related costs incurred during fiscal 2003
were primarily a result of the Bindley Western Industries, Inc. (which has been given the legal
designation of Cardinal Health 100, Inc. and is referred to in these &#147;Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements&#148; as &#147;Bindley&#148;) acquisition. During the fiscal years noted above, the Company
also incurred merger-related costs for numerous smaller acquisitions. The following table and
paragraphs provide additional detail regarding the types of merger-related costs incurred by the
Company.

employee-related costs associated with certain merger and acquisition transactions of $16.3
million, $11.9&nbsp;million and $18.7&nbsp;million, respectively. These costs primarily consist of
severance, stay bonuses, non-compete agreements and other forms of compensatory payouts made to
employees as a direct result of the mergers or acquisitions. The fiscal 2005 charges related
primarily to the Alaris and Syncor acquisitions. The fiscal 2004 charges were primarily a result
of the Syncor acquisition. In addition to these types of costs, during fiscal 2003, the Company
incurred a charge of $8.8&nbsp;million related to an approved plan to curtail defined benefit pension
plans within the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment. This curtailment resulted from
the plan to conform the employee benefit plans of R.P. Scherer Corporation (which has been given
the legal designation of Cardinal Health 409, Inc. and is referred to in these &#147;Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; as &#147;Scherer&#148;) to the Company&#146;s benefit plan structure at the
time of the Scherer merger. In fiscal 2005, $2.9&nbsp;million of the remaining accrual balance was
reversed as a result of lowered estimates for future payouts due to reduced headcount.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Fiscal 2005</U><I>.
</I>During fiscal 2005, the Company incurred costs recorded within other
special items totaling $54.6&nbsp;million. These costs primarily relate to legal fees and document
preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the SEC investigation and the Audit
Committee internal review and related matters. In addition, these costs include a $25.0&nbsp;million
reserve for the potential settlement with the SEC regarding  resolution of its
investigation with respect to the Company. Unless and until the SEC investigation is resolved,
there can be no assurance that the amount reserved by the Company for this investigation will be
sufficient and that a larger amount will not be required. Therefore, this reserve will be reviewed
on a quarterly basis and adjusted to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary. For
further information regarding these matters, see Note 1.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Fiscal 2004.</U>
 During fiscal 2004, the Company incurred other special items totaling
$37.9&nbsp;million. This total comprises two items. First, the
Company made a special contribution
to The Cardinal Health Foundation during the fourth quarter which totaled approximately $31.7
million. The special contribution was made as a direct result of a large pharmaceutical
manufacturer antitrust litigation settlement received during the fourth quarter. The Cardinal
Health Foundation is the primary vehicle used by the Company to provide charitable support to the
community and various organizations. Prior contributions to the Cardinal Health Foundation were
immaterial. Second, the Company incurred costs of $6.2&nbsp;million during the fourth quarter related
to the SEC investigation and the Audit Committee&#146;s internal review. These costs primarily
represent legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in responding to
requests related to the SEC&#146;s investigation and the Audit Committee&#146;s internal review. Prior costs
incurred related to these matters were immaterial. For further information regarding these
matters, see Note 1.

Alaris acquisition. The Company believes it will incur these costs to properly restructure,
integrate and rationalize operations, a portion of which represents facility rationalizations and
implementing efficiencies regarding information systems, customer systems, marketing programs and
administrative functions, among other things. Such amounts will be expensed as special items when
incurred.

The 7.30% Notes and the 7.80% and 7.00% Debentures represent unsecured obligations of Allegiance
Corporation, which are guaranteed by the Company. These obligations are not subject to a sinking
fund and are not redeemable prior to maturity, except for the 7.00% Debentures which included put
options that expired on September&nbsp;15, 2003, without any put options being exercised. Interest is
paid pursuant to the terms of the notes. These notes are structurally subordinated to the
liabilities of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries, including trade payables of $7.6&nbsp;billion and $650.0
million of preferred debt securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the Company&#146;s acquisition of Alaris in fiscal 2004, the Company assumed $195.3
million of Senior subordinated notes due 2011, which includes a premium of $20.3&nbsp;million based on
the fair value of the debt. The Senior subordinated notes bear interest at an annual rate of
7.25%, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on July 1 and January 1 of each year, commencing
January&nbsp;1, 2004, and mature on July&nbsp;1, 2011. The Senior subordinated notes are redeemable at the
option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time on or after July&nbsp;1, 2007 at an initial
redemption price of 103.625%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption,
with the redemption price declining annually thereafter. In addition, subject to certain
limitations, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the Senior subordinated notes on or before July&nbsp;1,
2006 with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, at a price of 107.25%, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. In the event of a change of
control, as defined in the indenture governing the Senior subordinated notes, holders may require
the Company to purchase their Senior subordinated notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The Senior subordinated notes
are subject to certain restrictive and reporting covenants. As of June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with all such covenants. During fiscal 2005, the Company paid off $183.6&nbsp;million of the
Senior subordinated notes and amended the bond indenture to remove the restrictive covenants. The
remaining balance at June&nbsp;30, 2005 of $11.6&nbsp;million is callable at any time on or after July&nbsp;1,
2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also related to the Alaris acquisition, the Company assumed a bank credit facility consisting
of a six-year $245&nbsp;million term loan and a five-year $30&nbsp;million revolving credit facility. During
fiscal 2005, the Company paid off the term loan and terminated the credit facility. At June&nbsp;30,
2004, $162.6&nbsp;million was outstanding under the term loan. The term loan bore interest at an annual
rate equal to current LIBOR or a fluctuating base rate, plus a margin of 2.25% as of June&nbsp;30, 2004.
The Company could elect to use either a one-, two-, three-, or six-month LIBOR rate. Alaris made
elections resulting in a weighted average interest rate at June

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has a commercial paper program, providing for the issuance of up to $1.5&nbsp;billion
in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper. The Company did not have any borrowings
outstanding under this program at June&nbsp;30, 2005, but had $634.2&nbsp;million outstanding under this
program at June&nbsp;30, 2004 with a market interest rate based upon LIBOR. The Company also had an
extendible commercial notes program providing for the issuance of up to $150.0&nbsp;million of
extendible commercial notes. The Company did not have any borrowings outstanding under this
extendible commercial notes program at June&nbsp;30, 2005 or June&nbsp;30, 2004. The Company also maintains
other short-term credit facilities and an unsecured line of credit that allow for borrowings up to
$322.7&nbsp;million. At June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, $136.0&nbsp;million and $68.4&nbsp;million, respectively, were
outstanding under these uncommitted facilities. The June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004 balances include $5.6
million and $15.0&nbsp;million, respectively, in short-term borrowings reclassified. The effective
interest rate as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004 was 0.72% and 1.68%, respectively. The June&nbsp;30, 2005
balance also includes $130.4&nbsp;million which is classified in other obligations. The remaining
$153.9&nbsp;million balance of other obligations at June&nbsp;30, 2005 consisted primarily of additional
notes, loans and capital leases. The June&nbsp;30, 2004 balance also includes $53.4&nbsp;million which is
classified in other obligations. The remaining $49.8&nbsp;million balance of other obligations at June
30, 2004 consists primarily of additional notes, loans and capital leases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also has two unsecured $750&nbsp;million bank revolving credit facilities, which provide for
up to an aggregate of $1.5&nbsp;billion in borrowings. One of these facilities expires on March&nbsp;24,
2008 and the other expires on March&nbsp;23, 2009. At expiration, these revolving credit facilities can
be extended upon mutual consent of the Company and the lending institutions. During the first
quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company borrowed $500&nbsp;million on its revolving credit facilities. The
proceeds of this borrowing were utilized to repay a portion of the Company&#146;s commercial paper and
for general corporate purposes, including the establishment of pharmaceutical inventory at the
Pharmaceutical Distribution business&#146; National Logistics Center in Groveport, Ohio. During the
second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company borrowed an additional $750&nbsp;million on the revolving
credit facilities, with the proceeds utilized primarily for the establishment of inventory at the
National Logistics Center. The Company fully repaid the $1.25&nbsp;billion in outstanding balances
under its bank revolving credit facilities during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 due to
stabilization in its short-term liquidity requirements in light of, among other things, the Company
having substantially completed the initial establishment of inventory at the National Logistics
Center . These revolving credit facilities exist largely to support issuances of
commercial paper as well as other short-term borrowings and remained unused at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and
2004, except for $46.2&nbsp;million and $37.3&nbsp;million, respectively, of standby letters of credit issued
on behalf of the Company. At June&nbsp;30, 2005, $5.6&nbsp;million of other short-term borrowings were
reclassified as long-term. At June&nbsp;30, 2004, $500.0&nbsp;million of commercial paper and $15.0&nbsp;million
of other short-term borrowings were reclassified as long-term. These reclassifications reflect the
Company&#146;s intent and ability, through the existence of the unused revolving credit facilities, to
refinance these borrowings. The remaining $134.2&nbsp;million of commercial paper outstanding at June
30, 2004 was classified as short-term.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to periodically sell trade
receivables to a special purpose accounts receivable and financing entity (the &#147;Accounts Receivable
and Financing Entity&#148;), which is exclusively engaged in purchasing trade receivables from, and
making loans to, the Company. The Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity, which is consolidated
by the Company as it is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity, issued $250
million and $400&nbsp;million in preferred variable debt securities to parties not affiliated with the
Company during fiscal 2004 and 2001, respectively. These preferred debt securities are classified
as long-term debt in the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheet. These preferred debt securities must
be retired or redeemed by the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity before the Company, or its
creditors, can have access to the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity&#146;s receivables. At June
30, 2005 and 2004, the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity owned approximately $534.0&nbsp;million
and $506.9&nbsp;million, respectively, of receivables that are included in the Company&#146;s consolidated
balance sheet. The effective interest rate as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004 was 3.96% and 2.36%,
respectively. Other than for loans made to the Company or for breaches of certain representations,
warranties or covenants, the Accounts Receivable and Financing Entity does not have any recourse
against the general credit of the Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company had a long-term obligation that was collateralized with property and equipment of
the Company with an aggregate book value of approximately $70&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2004. The
collateralized obligation was paid off during fiscal 2005. Any future obligation under the
borrowing facility would be subject to the same collateralization provisions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Interest Rate Risk Management. </B>The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. The
Company&#146;s objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and
on the market value of its borrowings. The Company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of
its net debt within a certain range.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company utilizes a mix of debt maturities along with both fixed-rate and variable-rate
debt to manage changes in interest rates. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps
to further manage its exposure to interest rate variations related to its borrowings and to lower
its overall borrowing costs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company held two pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the variability
of cash flows relating to forecasted transactions. These contracts were classified as cash flow
hedges and mature through 2010 and 2017, respectively. The Company adjusted these pay-fixed
interest rate swaps to current market values through other comprehensive income, as the contracts
were effective in offsetting the interest rate exposure of the forecasted transactions. During
fiscal 2005, the Company held two additional pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the variability
of cash flows related to forecasted transactions. These contracts were classified as cash flow
hedges and matured through 2010 and 2017, respectively. The forecasted transactions related to the
two additional pay-fixed interest rate swaps did not occur during fiscal 2005, and thus, a portion
of each of the contracts became ineffective. Payments totaling $11.6&nbsp;million were made to
terminate the contracts in fiscal 2005 and the ineffective portion of each of the contracts,
totaling $1.3&nbsp;million, was recorded in interest expense and other during fiscal 2005. The
remaining $10.3&nbsp;million of the payments that relates to the portion of the contracts that was
effective prior to the termination date was adjusted to current market value through other
comprehensive income during fiscal 2005, and an adjustment will be recognized in interest expense
and other in future periods in conjunction with the occurrence of the originally forecasted
transactions. At June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company held two pay-fixed interest rate swaps acquired
through the Alaris acquisition. These pay-fixed interest rate swaps were utilized by Alaris to
hedge a bank term loan. These swaps were unwound in fiscal 2005 upon the Company&#146;s election to pay
down the bank term loan (see Note 6). The impact in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial
statements was not material.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also held pay-floating interest rate swaps to hedge the change in fair value of
the fixed-rate debt related to fluctuations in interest rates. These contracts are classified as
fair value hedges and mature through June&nbsp;2015. The gain/(loss) recorded on the pay-floating
interest rate swaps is directly offset by the change in fair value of the underlying debt. Both
the derivative instrument and the underlying debt are adjusted to market value at the end of each
period with any resulting gain/(loss) recorded in interest expense and other.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table represents the notional amount hedged, fair value of the interest rate
swaps outstanding at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004 included in other assets/liabilities. The net gains
for pay-floating interest rate swaps recognized through interest expense and other during fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $22.7&nbsp;million, $34.8&nbsp;million and $27.1&nbsp;million,
respectively.

currencies and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. The Company&#146;s
objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate
changes to allow management to focus its attention on its business operations. Accordingly, the
Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to
protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated
foreign currency revenue and expenses. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in
the value of the underlying transactions as they occur.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, the Company held forward contracts expiring through June&nbsp;2006 and
June&nbsp;2005, respectively, to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, revenue and expenses. These
hedging contracts are classified as cash flow hedges and, accordingly, are adjusted to current
market values through other comprehensive income until the underlying transactions are recognized.
Upon recognition, such gains and losses are recorded in operations as an adjustment to the recorded
amounts of the underlying transactions in the period in which these transactions are recognized.
The principal currencies hedged are the European euro, British pound, Mexican peso, Canadian
dollar, Australian dollar and Thai bhat.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company also held forward contracts expiring in December&nbsp;2013 at June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004,

contracts are classified as fair value hedges and are adjusted to current market values through
interest expense and other, directly offsetting the adjustment of the foreign currency asset or
liability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. A provision of the AJCA creates a
temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by
providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign
corporations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company determined that it will
repatriate $500&nbsp;million of accumulated foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 pursuant to the repatriation
provisions of the AJCA, and accordingly has recorded a related tax liability of $26.3&nbsp;million as of
June&nbsp;30, 2005. The $500&nbsp;million is the maximum repatriation available to the Company under the
repatriation provisions of the AJCA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of June&nbsp;30, 2005 the Company
had $905&nbsp;million (net of the $500&nbsp;million to be repatriated in
fiscal 2006) of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be
permanently reinvested in foreign operations. These earnings are considered permanently
reinvested, thus no U.S. tax provision has been accrued related to the repatriation of these
earnings. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S tax that might be payable on the
eventual remittance of such earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax
reporting bases of assets and liabilities, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax
purposes. The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company had gross federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
$127.1&nbsp;million and $708.3&nbsp;million, respectively. A gross valuation allowance of $397.8&nbsp;million at
June&nbsp;30, 2005 has been provided for the state net operating loss, as utilization of such
carryforwards within the applicable statutory periods is uncertain. The state net operating loss
carryforwards expire through 2025. Expiring state net operating loss carryforwards and the
required valuation allowances have been adjusted annually. The Company also has gross federal
capital loss carryovers of $14.7&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2005 for which no valuation allowance has been
established. After application of the valuation allowances described above, the Company
anticipates no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred
income tax assets described above.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a tax-sharing agreement with Baxter International Inc., Allegiance Corporation will pay
for increases and be reimbursed for decreases to the net deferred tax assets transferred on the
date of the Baxter-Allegiance Spin-Off (as hereinafter defined in Note 11). Such increases or
decreases may result from audit adjustments to Baxter&#146;s prior period tax returns.

postretirement benefit and defined contribution plans. Substantially all of the Company&#146;s domestic
non-union employees are eligible to be enrolled in Company-sponsored contributory profit sharing
and retirement savings plans, which include features under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), and provide for Company matching and profit sharing
contributions. The Company&#146;s contributions to the plans are determined by the Board of Directors
subject to certain minimum requirements as specified in the plans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expense for employee retirement benefit plans (excluding defined benefit and other
postretirement benefit plans, see below) was $86.1&nbsp;million, $54.5&nbsp;million and $64.2&nbsp;million for the
fiscal years ended June&nbsp;30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Defined Benefit and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. </B>The Company has several defined benefit
plans covering substantially all Scherer salaried and hourly employees. The Company also assumed
defined benefit plans through certain acquisitions including Intercare and Alaris. The Company&#146;s domestic
defined benefit plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and level of compensation.
Foreign subsidiaries provide for pension benefits in accordance with local customs or law. The
Company funds its pension plans at amounts required by applicable regulations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment policy reflects the long-term nature of the plans&#146; funding obligations. The
assets are invested to provide the opportunity for both income and growth of principal. This
objective is pursued as a long-term goal designed to provide required benefits for participants
without undue risk. It is expected that this objective can be achieved through a well-diversified
asset portfolio. All equity investments are made within the guidelines of quality, marketability
and diversification mandated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#147;ERISA&#148;) and other
relevant statutes. Investment managers are directed to maintain equity portfolios at a risk level
approximately equivalent to that of the specific benchmark established for that portfolio. Assets
invested in fixed income securities and pooled fixed income portfolios are managed actively to
pursue opportunities presented by changes in interest rates, credit ratings or maturity premiums.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company periodically enters into certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily
receivable sales and operating leases, in order to maximize diversification of funding and return

to third parties.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Lease Receivable-Related Arrangements</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2004, the Company entered into two separate agreements to transfer ownership of
certain equipment lease receivables, plus security interests in the related equipment, to the
leasing subsidiary of a bank in the amounts of $164.2&nbsp;million and $150.0&nbsp;million. These
transactions resulted in immaterial gains or losses classified by the Company as revenue within its
results of operations. In order to qualify for sale treatment under SFAS No.&nbsp;140, &#147;Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,&#148; the Company formed
wholly-owned, special purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries (the &#147;Pyxis SPEs&#148;) of Pyxis
Corporation (which has been given the legal designation of Cardinal Health 301, Inc. and is
referred to in this Form 10-K as &#147;Pyxis&#148;), and each of the Pyxis SPEs formed wholly-owned,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">statements. In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;140, the Company consolidates the Pyxis SPEs and does
not consolidate the QSPEs. Both the Pyxis SPEs and QSPEs are separate legal entities that maintain
separate financial statements from the Company and Pyxis. The assets of the Pyxis SPEs and QSPEs
are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of their respective creditors.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company formed Pyxis Funding LLC (&#147;Pyxis Funding&#148;) for the sole purpose of acquiring a
pool of leases and the related leased equipment from Pyxis and ultimately selling the lease
receivables to a multi-seller conduit administered by a third-party bank. Pyxis Funding is a
wholly-owned, special purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary of Pyxis. Pyxis Funding II LLC (&#147;Pyxis
Funding II&#148;) was formed for the sole purpose of acquiring lease receivables from Pyxis Funding and
issuing notes secured by its assets to a multi-seller conduit administered by a third-party bank.
Pyxis Funding II is a wholly-owned, qualified special purpose subsidiary of Pyxis Funding. The
transaction qualifies for sale treatment under SFAS No.&nbsp;140. Accordingly, the related receivables
are not included in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. As required by U.S. GAAP, the
Company consolidates Pyxis Funding and does not consolidate Pyxis Funding II. Both Pyxis Funding
and Pyxis Funding II are separate legal entities that maintain separate financial statements from
the Company and Pyxis. The assets of Pyxis Funding and Pyxis Funding II are available first and
foremost to satisfy the claims of their respective creditors. During fiscal 2005, Pyxis exercised its option
to recall the agreement that issued the aforementioned notes. As a result the Company recorded an
immaterial loss. Therefore, at June&nbsp;30, 2005 the notes did not have a balance or the related
credit protection. The notes held by investors had a principal balance of $16.0&nbsp;million at June
30, 2004, and the investors were provided with credit protection in the form of 20% ($4.0&nbsp;million)
over-collateralization.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardinal Health Funding (&#147;CHF&#148;) and Medicine Shoppe Capital Corporation (&#147;MSCC&#148;) were
organized for the sole purpose of buying receivables and selling those receivables to multi-seller
conduits administered by third party banks or other third party investors. MSCC and CHF were
designed to be special purpose, bankruptcy-remote entities. Although consolidated in accordance
with GAAP, MSCC and CHF are separate legal entities from the Company, Medicine Shoppe
International, Inc. and the Company&#146;s Financial Shared Services business. The sale of receivables
by MSCC and CHF qualify for sales treatment under SFAS No.&nbsp;140 and accordingly are not included in
the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2004, the Company terminated and
liquidated MSCC resulting in an immaterial loss.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company had a committed receivables sales facility program available
through CHF with capacity to sell $800&nbsp;million in receivables. During the first quarter of fiscal
2005, the capacity under the committed receivables sales facility program was increased from $500
million to $800&nbsp;million. Recourse is provided under the program by the requirement that CHF retain
a percentage subordinated interest in the sold receivables. The Company sold $500&nbsp;million of
receivables under this committed receivables sales facility program during the first quarter of
fiscal 2005. The Company sold an additional $300&nbsp;million under this program during the second

Company repurchased $250&nbsp;million of receivables under this program. After these transactions, the
Company had $550&nbsp;million of receivable sales outstanding at June&nbsp;30, 2005. The Company also
provided a secured interest in the existing receivables of $274.2&nbsp;million at June&nbsp;30, 2005, as
required under this program. At June&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company had no outstanding receivables or
subordinated interests related to this facility.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has entered into operating lease agreements with several third party banks for the
construction of various facilities and equipment. The initial terms of the lease agreements have
varied maturity dates ranging from June&nbsp;2006 through June&nbsp;2013, with optional renewal periods,
generally five years. In the event of termination, the Company is required (at its election) to
either purchase the facility or vacate the property and make reimbursement for a portion of any
unrecovered property cost. The maximum portion of unrecovered property costs that the Company
could be required to reimburse does not exceed the amount expended to acquire and/or construct the
facilities. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, the amount expended to acquire and/or construct the facilities
was $256.4&nbsp;million. The agreements provide for maximum funding of $301.6&nbsp;million, which is
currently greater than the estimated cost to complete the construction projects. The required
lease payments equal the interest expense for the period on the amounts drawn. During fiscal 2005,
the Company decided to purchase certain buildings and equipment of approximately $132.3&nbsp;million
which were previously under operating lease agreements. In addition, certain of these leases
qualified as capital lease obligations, and accordingly, the Company had approximately $81.1
million of property and equipment offset by long-term liabilities on its balance sheet at June&nbsp;30,
2005. Based upon current market information obtained from a third party valuation expert, the
Company believes that the payment obligation under certain leases would exceed the proceeds from
the sale of related properties and equipment. Therefore, the Company recorded impairment charges
during fiscal 2005. See Note 21 below for additional information regarding these impairment
charges. Lease payments under the agreements are based primarily upon LIBOR and are subject to
interest rate fluctuations. As of June&nbsp;30, 2005, the weighted average interest rate on the
agreements approximated 4.01%. The Company&#146;s estimated minimum annual lease payments under the
agreements at June&nbsp;30, 2005 were approximately $10.3&nbsp;million.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;30, 1996, Baxter International Inc. (&#147;Baxter&#148;) and its subsidiaries transferred
to Allegiance Corporation and its subsidiaries (&#147;Allegiance&#148;), Baxter&#146;s U.S. health care
distribution business, surgical and respiratory therapy business and health care cost-management
business, as well as certain foreign operations (the &#147;Allegiance Business&#148;) in connection with a
spin-off of the Allegiance Business by Baxter. In connection with this spin-off, Allegiance
Corporation, which later merged with a subsidiary of the Company on February&nbsp;3, 1999, agreed to
indemnify Baxter, and to defend and indemnify Baxter Healthcare Corporation, as contemplated by the
agreements between Baxter and Allegiance Corporation, for all expenses and potential liabilities
associated with claims arising from the Allegiance Business, including certain claims of alleged
personal injuries as a result of exposure to natural rubber latex
gloves. Such claims, which name multiple defendants in addition to
Baxter/Allegiance, involved allegations of sensitization to natural
rubber latex products. The Company is not a
party to any of the lawsuits and has not agreed to pay any settlements to the plaintiffs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company reassessed its ability to estimate the
potential remaining costs of these lawsuits. Following this reassessment, during the first quarter
of fiscal 2005, the Company recognized a charge of $16.4&nbsp;million as its reasonable estimate of net
future costs to be incurred in defending or settling outstanding claims as well as pursuing
insurance recoveries. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company resolved claims
relating to substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for this litigation. Following
resolution of these claims, the Company concluded that it was in a position to reasonably estimate
the total remaining uninsured costs for this litigation. As such, during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Company recognized an additional charge of $11.8&nbsp;million as its reasonable estimate of
uninsured costs already incurred in
defending or settling outstanding claims. While the Company does not anticipate significant
charges in future periods, additional charges may be required if there is a significant increase in
the number of new lawsuits filed. Currently, the Company considers this potential

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">Derivative Actions
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;8, 2002, a complaint was filed by a purported shareholder against the Company and
its directors in the Court of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Ohio, as a purported derivative
action. <I>Doris Staehr v. Robert D. Walter, et al., No.&nbsp;02-CVG-11-639</I>. On or about March&nbsp;21, 2003,
after the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint, an amended complaint was filed alleging
breach of fiduciary duties and corporate waste in connection with the alleged failure by the Board
of Directors of the Company to renegotiate or terminate the Company&#146;s proposed acquisition of
Syncor, and to determine the propriety of indemnifying Monty Fu, the former Chairman of Syncor.
The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the amended complaint, and the plaintiffs subsequently filed
a second amended complaint that added three new individual defendants and included new allegations
that, among other things, the Company improperly recognized revenue in December&nbsp;2000 and September
2001 related to settlements with certain vitamin manufacturers. The Company filed a Motion to
Dismiss the second amended complaint, and on November&nbsp;20, 2003, the Court denied the motion. On
April&nbsp;14, 2005, the Court stayed the action for a period of six months. The defendants intend to
vigorously defend this action. The Company currently does not believe that the impact of this
lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s financial position, liquidity or
results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July&nbsp;1, 2004, three complaints have been filed by purported shareholders against the
members of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors, certain of its officers and employees and the Company
as a nominal defendant in the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio, as purported derivative
actions (collectively referred to as the &#147;Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative actions&#148;).
These cases include: <I>Donald Bosley, Derivatively on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. v. David Bing,
et al., Sam Wietschner v. Robert D. Walter, et al. </I>and <I>Green Meadow Partners, LLP, Derivatively on
behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. v. David Bing, et al</I>. The Cardinal Health Franklin County
derivative actions allege that the individual defendants failed to implement adequate internal
controls for the Company and thereby violated their fiduciary duty of good faith, GAAP and the
Company&#146;s Audit Committee charter. The complaints in the Cardinal Health Franklin County
derivative actions seek money damages and equitable relief against the defendant directors and an
award of attorney&#146;s fees. On November&nbsp;22, 2004, the Cardinal Health Franklin County derivative
actions were consolidated. Furthermore, by agreement of the parties, the Cardinal Health Franklin
County derivative actions have been stayed. None of the defendants has responded to the complaints
yet, nor has the Company.

the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases include: <I>Gerald
Burger v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 575), Todd Fener v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al.
(04 CV 579), E. Miles Senn v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 597), David Kim v. Cardinal

State of New Jersey v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 831) </I>and <I>First New York Securities, LLC
v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 911). </I>The Cardinal Health federal securities actions
purport to be brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Company&#146;s securities during various
periods beginning as early as October&nbsp;24, 2000 and ending as late as July&nbsp;26, 2004 and allege,
among other things, that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a) of
the Exchange Act by issuing a series of false and/or misleading statements concerning the Company&#146;s
financial results, prospects and condition. Certain of the complaints also allege violations of
Section&nbsp;11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, claiming material misstatements or omissions
in prospectuses issued by the Company in connection with its
acquisition of Bindley in 2001 and Syncor in 2003. The alleged misstatements relate to the Company&#146;s
accounting for recoveries relating to antitrust litigation against vitamin manufacturers, and to
classification of revenue in the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either operating
revenue or revenue from bulk deliveries to customer warehouses, among other matters. The alleged
misstatements are claimed to have caused an artificial inflation in the Company&#146;s stock price
during the proposed class period. The complaints seek unspecified money damages and equitable
relief against the defendants and an award of attorney&#146;s fees. On December&nbsp;15, 2004, the Cardinal
Health federal securities actions were consolidated into one action
captioned <I>In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Federal Securities Litigation</I>, and on January&nbsp;26, 2005,
the Court appointed the Pension Fund Group as lead plaintiff in this consolidated action. On April
22, 2005, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint naming the Company, certain
current and former officers and employees and the Company&#146;s external auditors as defendants. The
complaint seeks unspecified money damages and other unspecified relief against the defendants. On

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July&nbsp;2, 2004, 15 purported class action complaints (collectively referred to as the
&#147;Cardinal Health ERISA actions&#148;) have been filed against the Company and certain officers,
directors and employees of the Company by purported participants in the Cardinal Health Profit
Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan (now known as the Cardinal Health 401(k) Savings Plan, or the
&#147;401(k) Plan&#148;). To date, all of these actions have been filed in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Ohio. These cases include: <I>David McKeehan and James Syracuse v.
Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 643), Timothy Ferguson v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV
668), James DeCarlo v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 684), Margaret Johnson v. Cardinal
Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 722), Harry Anderson v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 725),
Charles Heitholt v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 736), Dan Salinas and Andrew Jones v.
Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 745), Daniel Kelley v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV
746), Vincent Palyan v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 778), Saul Cohen v. Cardinal Health,
Inc., et al. (04 CV 789), Travis Black v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 790), Wendy Erwin v.
Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 803), Susan Alston v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV
815), Jennifer Brister v. Cardinal Health, Inc., et al. (04 CV 828 </I>and <I>Gint Baukus v. Cardinal
Health, Inc., et al. (05 C2 101 ). </I>The Cardinal Health ERISA actions purport to be brought on
behalf of participants in the 401(k) Plan and the Syncor Employees&#146; Savings and Stock Ownership
Plan (the &#147;Syncor ESSOP,&#148; and together with the 401(k) Plan, the &#147;Plans&#148;), and also on behalf of
the Plans themselves. The complaints allege that the defendants breached certain fiduciary duties
owed under ERISA, generally asserting that the defendants failed to make full disclosure of the
risks to the Plans&#146; participants of investing in the Company&#146;s stock, to the detriment of the
Plans&#146; participants and beneficiaries, and that Company stock should not have been made available
as an investment alternative for the Plans&#146; participants. The misstatements alleged in the
Cardinal Health ERISA actions significantly overlap with the misstatements alleged in the Cardinal
Health federal securities actions. The complaints seek unspecified money damages and equitable
relief against the defendants and an award of attorney&#146;s fees. On December&nbsp;15, 2004, the Cardinal
Health ERISA actions were consolidated into one action captioned <I>In re Cardinal Health, Inc. ERISA
Litigation</I>. On January&nbsp;14, 2005, the court appointed lead counsel and liaison counsel for the
consolidated Cardinal Health ERISA action. On April&nbsp;29, 2005, the lead plaintiff filed a
consolidated amended ERISA complaint naming the Company, certain current and former directors,
officers and employees, the Company&#146;s Employee Benefits Policy Committee and Putnam Fiduciary Trust
Company as defendants. The complaint seeks unspecified money damages and other unspecified relief
against the defendants. On August&nbsp;22, 2005, the Company and certain defendants filed a Motion to
Dismiss the consolidated amended ERISA complaint.

&#147;Shareholder/ERISA Litigation against Cardinal Health,&#148; the Company currently believes that there
will be some insurance coverage available under the Company&#146;s insurance policies in effect at the
time the actions were filed. Such policies are with financially viable insurance companies, and
are subject to self-insurance retentions, exclusions, conditions, coverage gaps, policy limits and
insurer solvency.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleven purported class action lawsuits have been filed against Syncor and certain of its
officers and directors, asserting claims under the federal securities laws (collectively referred
to as the &#147;Syncor federal securities actions&#148;). All of these actions were filed in the United
States District Court for the Central District of California. These cases include <I>Richard Bowe v.
Syncor Int&#146;l Corp., et al., No.&nbsp;CV 02-8560 LGB (RCx) (C.D. Cal.), Alan Kaplan v. Syncor Int&#146;l

LGB (RCx) (C.D. Cal.)</I>. The Syncor federal securities actions purport to be brought on behalf of
all purchasers of Syncor shares during various periods, beginning as early as March&nbsp;30, 2000 and
ending as late as November&nbsp;5, 2002. The actions allege, among other things, that the defendants
violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated thereunder and Section 20(a)
of the Exchange Act by issuing a series of press releases and public filings disclosing significant
sales growth in Syncor&#146;s international business, but omitting mention of certain allegedly improper
payments to Syncor&#146;s foreign customers,
thereby artificially inflating the price of Syncor shares. A lead plaintiff has been appointed by
the Court in the Syncor federal securities actions, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed
May&nbsp;19, 2003, naming Syncor and 12 individuals, all former Syncor officers, directors and/or
employees, as defendants. The consolidated complaint seeks unspecified money damages and other
unspecified relief against the defendants. Syncor filed a Motion to Dismiss the consolidated
amended complaint on August&nbsp;1, 2003, and on December&nbsp;12, 2003, the Court granted the Motion to
Dismiss without prejudice. A second amended consolidated class action complaint was filed on

action complaint on March&nbsp;4, 2004. On July&nbsp;6, 2004, the Court granted Defendants&#146; Motion to
Dismiss without prejudice as to defendants Syncor, Monty Fu, Robert Funari and Haig Bagerdjian. As
to the other individual defendants, the Motion to Dismiss was granted with prejudice. On September
14, 2004, the lead plaintiff filed a Motion for Clarification of the Court&#146;s July&nbsp;6, 2004 dismissal
order. The court clarified its July&nbsp;6, 2004 dismissal order on November&nbsp;29, 2004 and the lead
plaintiff filed a third amended consolidated complaint on December&nbsp;29, 2004. Syncor filed a Motion
to Dismiss the third amended consolidated complaint on January&nbsp;31, 2005. On April&nbsp;15, 2005, the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;14, 2002, two additional actions were filed by individual stockholders of Syncor
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the &#147;Delaware actions&#148;) against seven of
Syncor&#146;s nine directors (the &#147;director defendants&#148;). The complaints in each of the Delaware
actions were identical and alleged that the director defendants breached certain fiduciary duties
to Syncor by failing to maintain adequate controls, practices and procedures to ensure that
Syncor&#146;s employees and representatives did not engage in improper and unlawful conduct. Both
complaints asserted a single derivative claim, for and on behalf of Syncor, seeking to recover all
of the costs and expenses that Syncor incurred as a result of the allegedly improper payments
(including the costs of the Syncor federal securities actions described above), and a single
purported class action claim seeking to recover damages on behalf of all holders of Syncor shares
in the amount of any losses sustained if consideration received by Syncor stockholders in the
Company&#146;s merger with Syncor was reduced. On November&nbsp;22, 2002, the plaintiff in one of the two
Delaware actions filed an amended complaint adding as defendants the Company, its subsidiary Mudhen
Merger Corporation and the remaining two Syncor directors, who are hereafter included in the term
&#147;director defendants.&#148; These cases have been consolidated under the caption <I>In re Syncor
International Corp. Shareholders Litigation </I>(the &#147;consolidated Delaware action&#148;). On August&nbsp;14,
2003, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss the operative complaint in the consolidated Delaware
action. At the end of September&nbsp;2003, plaintiffs in the consolidated Delaware action moved the
Court to file a second amended complaint. Plaintiffs&#146; request was granted in February&nbsp;2004. Monty
Fu was the only named defendant in the second amended complaint. On September&nbsp;15, 2004, the Court
granted Monty Fu&#146;s Motion to Dismiss the second amended complaint. The Court dismissed the second
amended complaint with prejudice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;18, 2002, two additional actions were filed by individual stockholders of Syncor
in the Superior Court of California for the County of Los Angeles (the &#147;California actions&#148;)
against the director defendants. The complaints in the California actions allege that the director
defendants breached certain fiduciary duties to Syncor by failing to maintain adequate controls,
practices and procedures to ensure that Syncor&#146;s employees and representatives did not engage in
improper and unlawful conduct. Both complaints asserted a single derivative claim, for and on
behalf of Syncor, seeking to recover costs and expenses that Syncor incurred as a result of the
allegedly improper payments. These cases include <I>Joseph Famularo v. Monty Fu, et al., Case No.
BC285478 (Cal. Sup. Ct., Los Angeles Cty.)</I>, and <I>Mark Stroup v. Robert G. Funari, et al., Case No.
BC285480 (Cal. Sup. Ct., Los Angeles Cty.)</I>. An amended complaint was filed on December&nbsp;6, 2002 in
one of the cases, purporting to allege direct claims on behalf of a class of shareholders. The
defendants&#146; motion for a stay of the California actions pending the resolution of the Delaware
actions (discussed above) was granted on April&nbsp;30, 2003. On November&nbsp;29, 2004, the court dismissed
the California actions with prejudice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A purported class action complaint, captioned <I>Pilkington v. Cardinal Health, et al., </I>was filed
on April&nbsp;8, 2003 against the Company, Syncor and certain officers and employees of the Company by a
purported participant in the Syncor ESSOP. A related purported class action complaint, captioned
<I>Donna Brown, et al. v. Syncor International Corp, et al., </I>was filed on September&nbsp;11, 2003 against
the Company, Syncor and certain individual defendants. Another related purported class action
complaint, captioned <I>Thompson v. Syncor International Corp., et al.</I>, was filed on January&nbsp;14, 2004
against the Company, Syncor and certain individual defendants. Each of these actions was brought
in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. A consolidated
complaint was filed on February&nbsp;24, 2004 against Syncor and certain former Syncor officers,
directors and/or employees alleging that the defendants breached certain fiduciary duties owed
under ERISA based on the same underlying allegations of improper and unlawful conduct alleged in
the federal securities litigation. The consolidated complaint seeks unspecified money damages and
other unspecified relief against the defendants. On April&nbsp;26, 2004, the defendants filed Motions
to Dismiss the consolidated complaint. On August&nbsp;24, 2004, the Court granted in part and denied in
part Defendants&#146; Motions to Dismiss. The Court dismissed, without prejudice, all claims against
defendants Ed Burgos and Sheila Coop, all claims alleging co-fiduciary liability against all
defendants, and all claims alleging that the individual defendants had conflicts of interest
precluding them from properly exercising their fiduciary duties under ERISA. A claim for breach of
the duty to prudently manage plan assets was upheld against Syncor, and a claim for breach of the
alleged duty to &#147;monitor&#148; the performance of Syncor&#146;s Plan Administrative Committee was upheld
against defendants Monty Fu and Robert Funari. In addition, the United States Department of Labor
is conducting an investigation of the Syncor ESSOP with respect to its compliance with ERISA
requirements. The

the Company and others in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.
<I>E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company v. Cardinal Health, Inc., BBA Materials Technology and BBA
Nonwovens Simpsonville, Inc., No.&nbsp;3-03-0848</I>. The complaint alleges various causes of action
against the Company relating to the production and sale of surgical drapes and gowns by the
Company&#146;s Medical Products and Services segment. DuPont&#146;s claims generally fall into the
categories of breach of contract, false advertising and patent infringement. The complaint does
not request a specific amount of damages. The Company believes that the claims made in the
complaint are without merit, and it intends to vigorously defend this action. The Company is owed
a defense and indemnity from its co-defendants with respect to DuPont&#146;s claim for patent
infringement. The Company currently does not believe that the impact of this lawsuit, if any, will

to an aggregate amount of $500&nbsp;million. Pursuant to this authorization, the Company repurchased
approximately 7.8&nbsp;million Common Shares having an aggregate cost of approximately $500&nbsp;million.
This repurchase was completed in January&nbsp;2003, and the repurchased shares were placed into treasury
shares to be used for general corporate purposes.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>13.&nbsp;CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company invests cash in deposits with major banks throughout the world and in high quality
short-term liquid instruments. Such investments are made only in instruments issued or enhanced by
high quality institutions. These investments mature within three months and the Company has not
incurred any related losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s trade receivables, finance notes and accrued interest receivables, and lease
receivables are exposed to a concentration of credit risk with customers in the retail and health
care sectors. Credit risk can be affected by changes in reimbursement and other economic pressures
impacting the hospital and acute care sectors of the health care industry. However, such credit
risk is limited due to supporting collateral and the diversity of the customer base, including its
wide geographic dispersion. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers&#146;
financial conditions and maintains reserves for credit losses. Such losses historically have been
within the Company&#146;s expectations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table summarizes all of the Company&#146;s customers which individually account for
at least 10% of the Company&#146;s revenue. The customers in the table below are serviced
through the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, CVS accounted for 25% and 18%, respectively, and
Walgreens accounted for 19% and 9%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s gross trade receivable balance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of the Company&#146;s businesses have entered into agreements with group purchasing
organizations (&#147;GPOs&#148;) that act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of
their members. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 15%, 17% and 17%, respectively, of
revenue was derived from GPO members through the contractual arrangements established with
Novation, LLC and Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P., the Company&#146;s two largest GPO relationships in
terms of revenue.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company maintains several stock
incentive plans (the &#147;Plans&#148;) for the benefit of certain
officers, directors and employees. Historically, employee options granted under the Plans
generally vested in full on the third anniversary of the grant date and were exercisable for
periods up to ten years from the date of grant at a price which equals fair market value at the
date of grant. Beginning in fiscal 2006, employee options granted under the Plans generally vest
in equal annual installments over four years and are exercisable for periods up to seven years from
the date of grant at a price which equals the fair market value at the date of grant. Under the
Plans the Company currently utilizes for equity award grants, the
Company was authorized to grant
up to 76.8 million shares as of June&nbsp;30, 2005, of which 53.7 million shares have been granted.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective fiscal 2004, the Company changed its method of recognizing cash discounts from
recognizing cash discounts as a reduction of cost of products sold primarily upon payment of vendor
invoices to recording cash discounts as a component of inventory cost and recognizing such
discounts as a reduction to cost of products sold upon the sale of inventory. The Company believes
the change in accounting method provides a more objectively determinable method of recognizing cash
discounts and a better matching of inventory cost to revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company recorded a $38.5&nbsp;million (net of tax of $22.5&nbsp;million) cumulative effect of change
in accounting in the consolidated statements of earnings. The cumulative effect reduced net
diluted earnings per Common Share by $0.09. The impact of this change for the fiscal year ended
June&nbsp;30, 2004 was an increase in earnings from continuing operations before cumulative effect of
change in accounting by approximately $13.2&nbsp;million. This resulted in an increase in diluted
earnings per Common Share from continuing operations of $0.03 for fiscal 2004. The pro forma effect
of this accounting change on prior periods is as follows:

Subsequent to the filing of the 2004 Form 10-K, certain errors were
identified related to the Company&#146;s fiscal 2002 pro forma
disclosures related to cash discounts. The errors were a result of
incomplete information used in the corresponding calculations. The
corrected fiscal 2002 pro forma disclosures are reflected in the
table above. The
impact of the correction of the errors on the previously reported pro forma fiscal 2002 amounts was as
follows: decreased pro forma earnings from continuing operations
before cumulative effect of change in accounting and pro forma net
earnings by $11.1 million, decreased pro forma basic and diluted
earnings per Common Share from continuing operations by $0.03, and
decreased pro forma net basic and diluted earnings per Common Share
from continuing operations by $0.02.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>18.&nbsp;SEGMENT INFORMATION</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s operations are principally managed on a products and services basis and are
comprised of four reportable business segments: Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services,
Medical Products and Services, Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services and Clinical Technologies
and Services (formed during the first quarter of fiscal 2005). Clinical Technologies and Services
includes Alaris, the Company&#146;s businesses formerly within the Automation and Information Services
segment and the Company&#146;s Clinical Services and Consulting business, which was formerly reported
under the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment. In June&nbsp;2004, the Company
acquired approximately 98.7% of Alaris&#146; outstanding common stock, and in July&nbsp;2004, Alaris merged
with a subsidiary of the Company to complete the transaction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also during the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company transferred its Specialty
Pharmaceutical Distribution business, previously included within the Pharmaceutical Distribution
and Provider Services segment, to the Medical Products and Services segment. These transfers were
effected to better align business operations with the current management and reporting structure.
Prior period financial results were adjusted to reflect these changes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During fiscal 2003, the Company reclassified Central Pharmacy Services, Inc. and Cord
Logistics, Inc. from the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment to the
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment and therefore restated these segments&#146; financial
results. All prior period financial results presented were adjusted to reflect these changes. In
addition, with the completion of the Syncor acquisition on January&nbsp;1, 2003, Syncor was included
within the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2003, the Company acquired Intercare, which operates specialty pharmaceutical
distribution and pharmaceutical manufacturing operations in Europe. For the fiscal year ended June
30, 2004, the results of operations of Intercare&#146;s Specialty Pharmaceutical Distribution business,
which is similar to the Company&#146;s Pharmaceutical Distribution business, were included within the
Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment (see footnote 1 in the table below for
further information). All other results of operations for Intercare were included within the
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment. This classification was not reported during the
second quarter fiscal 2004 immediately following the acquisition as the Company was still assessing
the appropriate segment reporting treatment. Intercare&#146;s results of operations for the second
quarter of fiscal 2004 were not material to the Company or the Company&#146;s individual segments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment distributes a broad line of
pharmaceuticals, health care products and other items typically sold by hospitals, retail drug
stores and other health care providers. Through the acquisition of Intercare, this segment also
operates a distribution network within the United Kingdom offering a specialized range of branded
and generic pharmaceutical products. This segment also provides distribution and other services to
pharmaceutical manufacturers through new distribution service agreements. The segment also
provides support services complementing its distribution activities. In addition, this segment
operates and franchises apothecary-style retail pharmacies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Products and Services segment manufactures medical, surgical and laboratory
products and distributes these self-manufactured products as well as products manufactured by other
suppliers to hospitals, physician offices, surgery centers and other health care providers. In
addition, the segment distributes oncology, therapeutic plasma and other specialty pharmaceutical
and biotechnology products to hospitals, clinics and other managed-care facilities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment provides products and services to the
health care industry through pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services in nearly all
oral and sterile dose forms, including those incorporating the Company&#146;s proprietary drug delivery
systems, such as softgel capsules, controlled release forms, Zydis&#174; fast dissolving wafers and
advanced sterile delivery technologies. This segment also provides comprehensive packaging,
radiopharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution, pharmaceutical development and analytical
science services and scientific and regulatory consulting, as well as medical education, marketing
and contract sales services. It also manufactures and markets generic injectible pharmaceutical
products for sale to hospitals, clinics and pharmacies in the United Kingdom.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clinical Technologies and Services segment provides products and services to hospitals and
other health care providers that focus on patient safety. This segment designs, develops and
markets intravenous medication safety and infusion therapy delivery systems and develops,
manufactures, leases, sells and services point-of-use systems that automate the
distribution and management of medications and supplies in hospitals and other health care
facilities. In addition, this segment provides services to the health care industry through
integrated pharmacy management, temporary pharmacy staffing and the gathering and recording of
clinical information for review, analysis and interpretation.

corporate allocation of certain administrative expenses. Information about interest income and
expense and income taxes is not provided on a segment level. In addition, special items and
impairment charges are not allocated to the segments. See Note 4 above for further discussion of
the Company&#146;s special items and Note 21 below for additional information regarding impairment
charges. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies.

fiscal 2004 were not material to the Company or the Company&#146;s individual segments.</TD>

to the business segments to estimate the costs the segments would have incurred for certain
services provided by the corporate entity. In addition, the Company attempts to maintain a
relatively consistent year-over-year rate of Corporate allocated costs. During the first
quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company will modify the way in which corporate costs are allocated
to the business segments, to better align corporate spending with the business segments based
on the benefits received. The presentation of the first quarter of fiscal 2006 results will

    <TD>Interest income adjustment &#150; At the direction of Corporate management, the former
Automation and Information Services segment sold portions of its leased asset portfolio and
transferred the proceeds to Corporate. As the capital proceeds associated with these sales
have not been redeployed within the business segment, but utilized for other general
corporate purposes, the segment was allocated a benefit by Corporate for the interest
income that would have been earned associated with these sold leases. In fiscal 2004, the
segment received a $21&nbsp;million allocation from Corporate. Effective the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Pyxis products business did not receive an allocation adjustment from
Corporate for the estimated interest income related to the sale of certain lease
portfolios.</TD>

of translating foreign subsidiaries&#146; operating results into U.S. dollars. Historically
since 2000, this segment&#146;s revenue and operating earnings were not impacted by foreign
exchange fluctuations as the Company applied constant exchange rates to translate its
foreign operating results into U.S. dollars and recorded the actual impact of foreign
exchange rate changes within the Corporate segment. For fiscal 2004 and 2003, $11.2
million and $17.5&nbsp;million of expenses were allocated to Corporate representing the
difference between &#147;constant rates&#148; and &#147;actual&#148; exchange rates. Effective the first
quarter of fiscal 2005, the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations were included in the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>20.&nbsp;GUARANTEES</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No.&nbsp;45, &#147;Guarantor&#146;s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.&#148;
This interpretation enhances a guarantor&#146;s disclosure requirements in its interim and annual
financial statements regarding obligations under certain guarantees. The Company adopted the
enhanced disclosure requirements in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The initial recognition and
measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees
issued or modified after December&nbsp;31, 2002.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company has contingent commitments related to certain operating lease agreements (see Note
10). These operating leases consist of certain real estate and equipment used in the operations of
the Company. In the event of termination of these operating leases, which range in length from one
to ten years, the Company guarantees reimbursement for a portion of any unrecovered property cost.
At June&nbsp;30, 2005, the maximum amount the Company could be required to reimburse was $278.5&nbsp;million.
During fiscal 2005, the Company decided to repurchase certain buildings and equipment of
approximately $132.3&nbsp;million which were previously under operating lease agreements. In addition,
certain of these leases qualified as capital lease obligations, and accordingly, the Company
recorded approximately $81.1&nbsp;million of property and equipment offset by long-term liabilities on
its balance sheet at June&nbsp;30, 2005. Based upon current market information obtained from a third
party valuation expert, the Company believed that the payment obligation under certain leases would
exceed the proceeds from the sale of related properties and equipment. Therefore, the Company
recorded impairment charges during fiscal 2005. See Note 21 below for additional information
regarding these impairment charges. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;45, the Company
recorded a liability of $3.8&nbsp;million as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 related to these agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ordinary course of business, the Company, from time to time, agrees to indemnify
certain other parties under agreements with the Company, including under acquisition and
disposition agreements, customer agreements and intellectual property licensing agreements. Such
indemnification obligations vary in scope and, when defined, in duration. In many cases, a maximum
obligation is not explicitly stated and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the liability
under such indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate, such
indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability. Historically, the Company has not,
individually or in the aggregate, made payments under these indemnification obligations in any
material amounts. In certain circumstances, the Company believes that its existing insurance
arrangements, subject to the general deduction and exclusion provisions, would cover portions of
the liability that may arise from these indemnification obligations. In addition, the Company
believes that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these indemnification
obligations is not significant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ordinary course of business, the Company, from time to time, enters into agreements
that obligate the Company to make fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events. Such
obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under acquisition transactions, where the
Company has agreed to make payments based upon the achievement of certain financial performance
measures by the acquired business. Generally, the obligation is capped at an explicit amount. The
Company&#146;s aggregate exposure for these obligations, assuming the achievement of all financial
performance measures, is not material. Any potential payment for these obligations would be
treated as an adjustment to the purchase price of the related entity and would
have no impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company classifies certain asset impairments related to restructurings in special items,
which are included in operating earnings within the consolidated statements of earnings. Asset
impairments not eligible to be classified as special items and gains and losses from the sale of
assets were historically classified in &#147;interest expense and other&#148; within the consolidated
statements of earnings. Significant asset impairments were incurred during fiscal 2005 and are
expected to be incurred in the future due to the Company&#146;s global restructuring program and ongoing
strategic planning efforts. Effective the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company presented
asset impairments and gains and losses not eligible to be classified as special items within
&#147;impairment charges and other&#148; within the consolidated statements of earnings. These asset
impairment charges were included within the Corporate segment&#146;s results. Prior period financial
results were reclassified to conform to this change in presentation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the acquisition of Syncor, the Company acquired certain operations of
Syncor that were discontinued. Prior to the acquisition, Syncor announced the discontinuation of
certain operations including the medical imaging business and certain overseas operations. The
Company continued with these plans and added additional international and non-core domestic
businesses to the discontinued operations. In accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144, &#147;Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,&#148; the net assets and results of operations of these
businesses were presented as discontinued operations. The Company sold substantially all of the
remaining discontinued operations prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The net
assets at June&nbsp;30, 2004 for the discontinued operations are included within the Pharmaceutical
Technologies and Services segment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $18.7

as discontinued operations as it did not qualify in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;144 until the second
quarter of fiscal 2005. The assets, liabilities and results of operations related to this business

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>23.&nbsp;INVESTMENTS</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2005 the Company invested approximately $79.8&nbsp;million in tax exempt variable
demand notes and approximately $20.0&nbsp;million in tax exempt auction rate securities. These
short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale on the Company&#146;s consolidated balance
sheet. The interest rate payable on these investments resets every seven days, and the investments
are automatically reinvested unless the Company provides notice of intent to liquidate to the
broker. The Company&#146;s investments in these securities are recorded at cost, which approximates
fair market value due to their variable interest rates. The underlying maturities of these
investments range from eight to thirty-five years. The bonds are issued by municipalities and
other tax exempt entities, but are backed by letters of credit from the banking institutions that
broker the debt placements. All of the investments are held in the custody of major financial
institutions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company also held a $16.7&nbsp;million cost investment. The entity invested
in is continuously incurring losses. The Company believes this investment is impaired; however, it
believes the impairment to be temporary. Therefore, no impairment has been recorded at June&nbsp;30,
2005. The entity is a start up organization and it was expected to incur losses through its fiscal
year 2005. The entity has strong cash flow and believes that it will be profitable in its fiscal
year 2006. The Company will continue to evaluate this investment for impairment and will recognize
a loss if the investment is deemed other-than-temporarily impaired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>24.&nbsp;SUBSEQUENT EVENTS</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proxy statement for its 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company
disclosed that it had discovered in 2004 that a portion of an option to purchase 1,425,000 of the
Company&#146;s Common Shares (giving effect to stock splits occurring after the date of grant) that had
been granted in November&nbsp;1999 to Robert D. Walter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, was in excess of that permitted to be granted to a single individual during any fiscal
year under the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (the &#147;Equity Incentive Plan&#148;).
The maximum number of Common Shares as to which option awards could be granted pursuant to the
terms of the Equity Incentive Plan was 562,500 Common Shares (although the Company would have been
permitted at the time to make a larger grant outside of such Equity Incentive Plan).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to satisfy the original intent and understanding of the Company with respect to the
1999 option award, and after consulting with its outside compensation consultant, on August&nbsp;2,
2005, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved a
grant to Mr.&nbsp;Walter, in lieu of the portion of the 1999 option award in excess of the share
limitation and in full satisfaction of any claims with respect to such portion, of a deferred
payment stock appreciation right (the &#147;SAR&#148;) with respect to 862,500 Common Shares. Following
ratification by the Board of Directors, the agreement between Mr.&nbsp;Walter and the Company setting
forth the terms of the SAR grant (the &#147;SAR Agreement&#148;) was executed on August&nbsp;3, 2005. Under the
terms of the SAR Agreement, upon exercise of the SAR, Mr.&nbsp;Walter will become entitled to receive
cash in an amount equal to the fair market value per underlying Common Share on the date of
exercise minus $31.167, the original exercise price of the 1999 option award, multiplied by the
number of Common Shares as to which the SAR is being exercised. Consistent with the fact that the
1999 option award is fully vested, the SAR is fully vested and has a term expiring on November&nbsp;15,
2009, the expiration date of the 1999 option award (or, if earlier, on the six-month anniversary of
Mr.&nbsp;Walter&#146;s termination of employment). In order to comply with Section&nbsp;409A of the Code, and to
avoid potential loss to the Company of a tax deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code, any
payment due to Mr.&nbsp;Walter will be deferred until six months following his termination of
employment, and will be credited with interest at the Prime Rate from the date of exercise until
the payment date. Any such payment will be subject to applicable tax withholding. The SAR
Agreement contains a confirmation and agreement by Mr.&nbsp;Walter and the Company that the portion of
the 1999 option award in excess of the share limitation is null and void. The 1999 option to
purchase 562,500 Common Shares which was not in excess of the maximum number permitted under the
Equity Incentive Plan remains outstanding and continues to be governed by the terms of the original
option agreement. The SAR Agreement also provides for reimbursement of certain legal fees incurred
by Mr.&nbsp;Walter in connection with the SAR and a March&nbsp;2005 deferred payment stock appreciation right
grant.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also subsequent to June&nbsp;30, 2005, the Company decided to repurchase certain buildings and
equipment of approximately $133.6&nbsp;million that were under both operating and capital lease
agreements at June&nbsp;30, 2005. The amounts under capital lease agreements were recorded in
&#147;long-term obligations, less current portion&#148; within the Company&#146;s consolidated balance sheets
at June&nbsp;30, 2005, due to the original maturity date of February&nbsp;2009. See Notes 6, 10 and 20
above for additional information regarding these lease agreements.

that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this
Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC rules and forms. The Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure
that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. The Company&#146;s internal controls are designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As disclosed in Notes 1 and 2 in &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; and described in
&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#148; prior to
filing the 2004 Form 10-K, the Company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to
its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements as a result of the internal
review undertaken by the Audit Committee with respect to certain accounting matters. Specifically,
the Company restated its consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and
the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, reclassified certain categories of revenue, reduced its
fourth quarter fiscal 2004 results for premature revenue recognition in its former Automation and
Information Services segment, and expanded disclosure. The reclassification and restatement
adjustments were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Audit Committee&#146;s internal review, since the end of fiscal 2004, the
Company has adopted and is in the process of implementing various measures in connection with the
Company&#146;s ongoing efforts to improve its internal control processes and corporate governance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</I></U>. Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company&#146;s internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the &#147;COSO criteria&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on management&#146;s assessment and the COSO criteria, management believes that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2005.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst &#038; Young LLP, has issued an
attestation report on management&#146;s assessment of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting. Ernst &#038; Young LLP&#146;s report appears below under this Item&nbsp;9a and expresses unqualified
opinions on management&#146;s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
financial reporting.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</I></U><I>. </I>With the
exception of certain of the measures detailed above, including the
Company appointing a new Chief Financial Officer, a new Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and a
new Chief Accounting Officer and Controller during the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2005, there were no
changes in the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June
30, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal
control over financial reporting.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U><I>Significant Deficiencies</I></U><I>. </I>As noted above, management&#146;s assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 did not result in
the identification of any material weaknesses. However, the Company has identified a limited number of
&#147;significant deficiencies&#148; (as defined under standards by
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) that do not, in the
aggregate, rise to the level of a material weakness. The Company has
developed specific action plans to address each of these significant
deficiencies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s management, including its principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer, does not expect that the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures and its
internal control processes will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error
or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any
system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error
or fraud may occur and may not be detected. The Company monitors its disclosure controls and
procedures and internal controls and makes modifications as necessary; the Company&#146;s intent in this
regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and the internal controls will be maintained
as dynamic systems that change (including with improvements and
corrections) as conditions warrant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
as discussed above under this Item&nbsp;9a, the Company&#146;s principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that the Company&#146;s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2005. In addition, also as discussed above, the
Company&#146;s management believes that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2005.

ASSESSMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The Shareholders and the<BR>
Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc.:</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have audited management&#146;s assessment, included in the accompanying &#147;Management&#146;s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,&#148; that Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
&#147;Company&#148;) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Company&#146;s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management&#146;s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management&#146;s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, management&#146;s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June&nbsp;30, 2005, based on the COSO
criteria.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Cardinal Health, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of June&nbsp;30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
shareholders&#146; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June&nbsp;30, 2005
and our report dated September 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated effective January&nbsp;1, 2005
(the &#147;Deferred Compensation Plan&#148;), was adopted by the Board of Directors effective April&nbsp;7, 1994.
On December&nbsp;8, 2004, the Deferred Compensation Plan was amended and restated effective January&nbsp;1,
2005 to reflect the consolidation of the Company&#146;s Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended
and restated, with and into the Deferred Compensation Plan for Company executives and to address
changes required of nonqualified deferred compensation plans by new Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, enacted as part of the AJCA. The plan permits certain management
employees of the Company to defer salary and bonus into any of several investment alternatives,
including a stock equivalent account. In addition, the Company may, in its discretion, make
additional matching or fixed contributions to the deferred balances of participating management
employees. The plan also permits directors of the Company to defer board fees into any of several
investment alternatives, including a stock equivalent account. Deferrals into the stock equivalent
account are valued as if each deferral were invested in the Company&#146;s Common Shares as of the
deferral date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For management employees, deferred balances are paid upon retirement, termination from
employment, death or disability. For directors, deferred balances are paid upon retirement or
other termination from board service, death or disability. The maximum aggregate number of Common
Shares that can be credited to stock equivalent accounts pursuant to the plan is 2.34&nbsp;million.
Deferred balances are paid in cash, or in Common Shares in kind, with any fractional shares paid in
cash. The plan contains a dividend reinvestment feature for the stock equivalent account with
dividends generally being reinvested in investment options other than the stock equivalent account
for reporting persons under Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act. The plan is not intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code and is exempt from many of the provisions of ERISA as a &#147;top hat&#148;
plan for a select group of management or highly compensated employees.

Purchase Plan&#148;), was adopted by the Board of Directors effective August&nbsp;11, 1999 and amended by
action of the Plan Administrator on April&nbsp;7, 2005. The plan permits certain international
employees to purchase Common Shares through payroll deductions. The total number of Common Shares
made available for purchase under the plan is 4.5&nbsp;million. International employees who have been
employed by the Company for at least 30&nbsp;days may be eligible to contribute from 1% to 15% of
eligible compensation. The purchase price is determined by the lower of 85% of the closing market
price on the first day of the offering period or 85% of the closing market price on the last day of
the offering period. During any given calendar year, there are two offering periods: January
1&#150;June&nbsp;30; and July 1&#150;December&nbsp;31. The plan is not intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code and is not subject to any of the provisions of ERISA.
