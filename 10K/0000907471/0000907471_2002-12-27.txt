Item 1. Description of Business

General

     First  Midwest  Financial,  Inc. is a Delaware  corporation,  the principal
assets of which  are all the  issued  and  outstanding  shares of First  Federal
Savings  Bank  of  the  Midwest  ("First   Federal")  and  Security  State  Bank
("Security").  First Midwest, on September 20, 1993, acquired all of the capital
stock of First Federal in connection  with First  Federal's  conversion from the
mutual to stock form ownership (the "Conversion").  On September 30, 1996, First
Midwest  became a bank holding  company  upon its  acquisition  of Security,  as
discussed below.

     Since  the  Conversion,   the  Company  has  acquired   several   financial
institutions.  On March 28, 1994, First Midwest acquired  Brookings Federal Bank
in Brookings,  South Dakota  ("Brookings").  On December 29, 1995, First Midwest
acquired Iowa Savings Bank, FSB in Des Moines, Iowa ("Iowa Savings").  Brookings
and Iowa Savings were both merged with,  and now operate as divisions  of, First
Federal.  On September 30, 1996,  First Midwest  completed  the  acquisition  of
Central West Bancorporation ("CWB"). CWB was the holding company for Security in
Stuart,  Iowa,  which  upon the  merger of CWB into First  Midwest  resulted  in
Security becoming a stand-alone banking subsidiary of First Midwest.  Unless the
context  otherwise  requires,  references  herein to the Company  include  First
Midwest,  Security  and First  Federal and all  subsidiaries  on a  consolidated
basis.

     First Federal and Security (collectively, the "Banks") are the only direct,
active banking subsidiaries of First Midwest.  The Banks are  community-oriented
financial  institutions  offering a variety of  financial  services  to meet the
needs of the communities they serve. The Company,  through the Banks, provides a
full range of  financial  services.  The  principal  business  of First  Federal
historically has consisted of attracting retail deposits from the general public
and investing those funds primarily in one- to four-family  residential mortgage
loans  and,  to a  lesser  extent,  commercial  and  multi-family  real  estate,
agricultural  operating and real estate,  construction,  consumer and commercial
business  loans  primarily  in First  Federal's  market  area.  Recently,  First
Federal's lending  activities have expanded to include an increased  emphasis on
originations  of commercial  and  multi-family  real estate loans and commercial
business loans. The principal  business of Security has been and continues to be
attracting  retail deposits from the general public and investing those funds in
agricultural  real estate and operating  loans,  and commercial and multi-family
real estate  loans and, to a lesser  extent,  one- to  four-family  residential,
commercial business and consumer loans. The Banks also purchase  mortgage-backed
securities  and  invest in U.S.  Government  and  agency  obligations  and other
permissible investments.  At September 30, 2002, the Company had total assets of
$607.6 million,  deposits of $355.8 million,  and shareholders'  equity of $44.6
million.

     The  Company's  revenues are derived  primarily  from  interest on mortgage
loans,  mortgage-backed  securities,  investments,  consumer loans, agricultural
operating loans, commercial business loans, income from service charges and loan
originations,  loan  servicing  fee  income,  and income from the sale of mutual
funds, insurance products,  annuities and brokerage services through its service
corporation subsidiaries.

     First Federal, directly through its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Services
Financial  Limited ("First  Services"),  offers mutual funds,  equities,  bonds,
insurance products and annuities.

     First Services  Trust Company,  established in April 2002 as a wholly-owned
subsidiary  of First  Midwest,  provides a full range of trust  services.  First
Midwest  Financial  Capital  Trust,  also a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  First

                                       2

Midwest,  was  established  in July  2001 for the  purpose  of  issuing  Company
Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities.

     First Midwest and the Banks are  subject to  comprehensive  regulation.
     See "Regulation" herein.

     The  executive  offices of the Company are located at Fifth at Erie,  Storm
Lake, Iowa 50588. Its telephone number at that address is (712) 732-4117.

Market Area

     First Federal Savings Bank of the Midwest has four divisions: First Federal
Savings Bank Storm Lake,  Brookings  Federal  Bank,  Iowa Savings Bank and First
Federal Savings Bank Sioux Falls. First Federal's headquarters is located on the
corner of Fifth and Erie streets in Storm Lake,  Iowa.  First Federal Storm Lake
operates a total of seven  offices in Storm Lake,  Lake View,  Laurens,  Manson,
Odebolt  and Sac City,  Iowa.  Brookings  Federal  Bank  operates  one office in
Brookings,  South  Dakota.  Iowa Savings Bank  operates  four  facilities in Des
Moines,  West Des Moines and  Urbandale,  Iowa.  First Federal Sioux Falls moved
from its temporary facility to a newly constructed building in April 2001.

     Security  State Bank  operates  its  business  through  three  full-service
offices in Casey, Menlo and Stuart, Iowa.

     The  Company's  primary  market area  includes the Iowa  counties of Adair,
Buena Vista,  Calhoun,  Guthrie,  Ida,  Pocahontas,  Polk and Sac, and the South
Dakota counties of Brookings, Lincoln and Minnehaha.

     Storm Lake is located in northwest Iowa  approximately  150 miles northwest
of Des Moines and 200 miles south of  Minneapolis  in Buena Vista  County.  Like
much of the State of Iowa, Storm Lake and the surrounding market area are highly
dependent upon farming and  agricultural  markets.  Major  employers in the area
include Buena Vista Regional Medical Center,  IBP/Tyson,  Inc., Bil Mar Foods of
Iowa,  and Buena Vista  University,  which  currently  enrolls  1,267  full-time
students at its Storm Lake campus and employs 79 full-time faculty.

     Brookings is located in east central South Dakota,  approximately  50 miles
north of Sioux Falls and 200 miles west of Minneapolis in Brookings County.  The
bank's market area encompasses  approximately a 30-mile radius of Brookings. The
area is  generally  rural,  and  agriculture  is a  significant  industry in the
community.  South Dakota State  University is the largest employer in Brookings.
The University  had 9,350  students  enrolled for the 2001 fall term and employs
509 full-time faculty. The community also has several  manufacturing  companies,
including 3M, Larson  Manufacturing,  Daktronics,  Falcon Plastics and Twin City
Fan.  The  Brookings  division  operates  from an  office  located  in  downtown
Brookings.

     Des Moines,  Iowa's  capitol,  is located in central  Iowa.  The Des Moines
market area encompasses Polk County and surrounding counties.  Iowa Savings Bank
Division's main office is located just off I-80 at the intersection of two major
streets in Urbandale - an area  experiencing  significant  growth.  The West Des
Moines office  operates near a  high-traffic  intersection,  across from a major
shopping mall. The Ingersoll office is located near the heart of Des Moines,  on
a major thorough fare, in a densely  populated  area. The Highland Park facility
is located in a historical district approximately five minutes north of downtown
Des Moines.  Des Moines is one of the top three insurance  centers in the world,
with sixty-seven  insurance  company  headquarters and over one hundred regional
insurance  offices.  Other major  businesses  include Hy-Vee Food Stores,  Inc.,
Bridgestone-Firestone, Inc., Communication Data Services, Inc., Pioneer Hi-Bred,

                                       3

John Deere,  and Meredith  Corporation.  Universities  in the area include Drake
University, Upper Iowa University, Simpson College, Grand View College, Hamilton
College and the Des Moines University - Osteopathic Medical Center.

     Sioux  Falls is  located  at the  crossroads  of  Interstates  29 and 90 in
southeast  South Dakota,  270 miles  southwest of  Minneapolis.  The Sioux Falls
market area  encompasses  Minnehaha  and Lincoln  counties.  The city has ranked
number  two on the list of  national  entrepreneurial  hot spots in 1999 and was
among the top ten cities for new jobs and for new or expanded facilities in 1998
(Cogenetics,  Inc. April 1999; Site Selection,  1998).  The bank is located at a
high-traffic  intersection  of  Minnesota  and 33rd in the heart of Sioux Falls.
Major  employers  in the area  include  Sioux Valley  Hospital,  Avera  McKennan
Hospital,  John Morrell & Company,  Gateway, Inc., and Hy-Vee Food Stores. Sioux
Falls is also home to Augustana  College with 2001 enrollment of 1,807,  and The
University of Sioux Falls with 2001 enrollment of 1,332.

     Security's main office operates in Stuart, which is located in west-central
Iowa,  approximately  40 miles  west of Des  Moines  on the  border of Adair and
Guthrie  counties.  Security's  market area is highly  dependent  on farming and
agriculture.  Local businesses include Agri-Drain  Corporation,  Cardinal Glass,
Rose Acre Farms and Schafer  Systems,  Inc. In addition,  a large number of area
residents  commute to Des Moines for work. In recent years,  efforts of the West
Central I-80 Development Corporation have resulted in significant development of
new  service-related  businesses  in the  area,  associated  with  the  westward
expansion of Des Moines and direct interstate  highway access.  Seven industrial
parks exist in these two counties.  This development provides economic diversity
to Security's market area.

     Several of the Company's market areas are dependant on  agriculture-related
businesses.  Agriculture-related  businesses in recent years have performed well
due to a relatively  stable  agricultural  environment  in the Company's  market
area.  Generally low commodity prices have challenged area farmers over the past
few years,  however,  commodity  prices have improved over the past year to help
stabilize  the  agricultural  economy.  Although  there has been minimal  effect
observed to date, an extended  period of low commodity  prices could result in a
reduced   demand  for  goods  and  services   provided  by   agriculture-related
businesses,  which could also affect other  businesses in the  Company's  market
area.

Lending Activities

     General.  Historically,  the Company  has  originated  fixed-rate,  one- to
four-family  mortgage loans. In the early 1980's,  the Company began to focus on
the origination of  adjustable-rate  mortgage ("ARM") loans and short-term loans
for retention in its  portfolio in order to increase the  percentage of loans in
its portfolio with more frequent  repricing or shorter  maturities,  and in some
cases higher yields,  than fixed-rate  residential  mortgage loans. The Company,
however,  has continued to originate  fixed-rate  residential  mortgage loans in
response  to consumer  demand.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis --
Asset/Liability Management" in the Annual Report.

     While the Company  historically  has focused its lending  activities on the
origination  of loans  secured  by first  mortgages  on  owner-occupied  one- to
four-family  residences,   it  also  originates  and  purchases  commercial  and
multi-family  real estate loans and originates  consumer,  commercial  business,
residential and commercial  construction and  agriculturally  related loans. The
Company  originates most of its loans in its primary market area. More recently,
the Company  has  increased  its  emphasis,  both in  absolute  dollars and as a
percentage of its gross loan portfolio,  on all types of commercial  lending. At
September 30, 2002, the Company's net loan portfolio totaled $343.2 million,  or
56.5% of the Company's total assets.

     Loan  applications are initially  considered and approved at various levels
of authority, depending on the type, amount and loan-to-value ratio of the loan.
The  Company  has loan  committees  for each of the  Banks.  Loans in  excess of

                                       4

<PAGE>


certain amounts require the approval of at least two committee  members who must
also be executive officers,  by the Bank's Board loan committee or by the Bank's
Board of Directors,  which has responsibility for the overall supervision of the
loan portfolio. The Company reserves the right to discontinue,  adjust or create
new lending programs to respond to its needs and to competitive factors.

     At September 30, 2002,  the Company's  largest  lending  relationship  to a
single borrower or group of related borrowers totaled $8.7 million.  The Company
had  nineteen  other  lending  relationships  in  excess of $3.0  million  as of
September 30, 2002 with the average  outstanding  balance of such loans totaling
approximately  $4.4  million.  At September  30,  2002,  each of these loans was
performing in accordance with its repayment terms.

     The  total  amount  of loans  due  after  September  30,  2003  which  have
predetermined  interest rates is $138.2 million, while the total amount of loans
due after such date which have floating or adjustable  interest  rates is $169.1
million.

     One- to  Four-Family  Residential  Mortgage  Lending.  One- to  four-family
residential  mortgage loan originations are generated by the Company's marketing
efforts, its present customers, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate
agents and builders.  At September 30, 2002,  the Company's  one- to four-family
residential  mortgage  loan  portfolio  totaled $73.9  million,  or 20.8% of the
Company's total gross loan portfolio.  Approximately 20.7% of the Company's one-
to  four-family  mortgage  loans or 4.3% of the Company's  gross loans have been
purchased,  generally from other financial  institutions.  The majority of these
are ARM loans. See "--Originations,  Purchases, Sales and Servicing of Loans and
Mortgage-Backed  Securities."  At September  30, 2002,  the average  outstanding
principal  balance  of a one-  to  four-family  residential  mortgage  loan  was
$57,000.

     The  Company  offers  fixed-rate  and ARM  loans.  During  the  year  ended
September 30, 2002, the Company originated $1.9 million of adjustable-rate loans
and $49.5 million of fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residential
real estate,  of which  approximately  $29.9 million was held in portfolio.  The
Company's  one- to four-family  residential  mortgage  originations  are secured
primarily  by  properties  located in its primary  market  area and  surrounding
areas.

     The Company originates one- to four-family  residential mortgage loans with
terms up to a maximum of 30-years and with loan-to-value ratios up to 97% of the
lesser of the appraised  value of the security  property or the contract  price.
The Company generally requires that private mortgage insurance be obtained in an
amount  sufficient  to  reduce  the  Company's  exposure  to at or below the 80%
loan-to-value  level or the loans are sold.  Residential  loans generally do not
include prepayment penalties.

     The Company  currently  offers one,  three,  five and seven year ARM loans.
These loans have a fixed-rate for the stated period and, thereafter,  such loans
adjust annually.  These loans generally provide for an annual cap of up to a 200
basis points and a lifetime cap of 600 basis points over the initial  rate. As a
consequence of using an initial fixed-rate and caps, the interest rates on these
loans  may not be as rate  sensitive  as is the  Company's  cost of  funds.  The
Company's  ARMs do not permit  negative  amortization  of principal  and are not
convertible into a fixed rate loan. The Company's delinquency  experience on its
ARM loans has generally been similar to its experience on fixed rate residential
loans.

     Due to consumer demand,  the Company also offers fixed-rate  mortgage loans
with terms up to 30 years,  most of which conform to secondary market standards,
i.e., Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac standards.  Interest rates charged
on  these  fixed-rate  loans  are  competitively   priced  according  to  market
conditions.  The Company  currently  sells most,  but not all, of its fixed-rate
loans with terms of 15 years or longer.  Historically,  the  Company had held in
portfolio a higher percentage of its fixed rate mortgage loans.

     In  underwriting  one- to four-family  residential  real estate loans,  the
Company  evaluates both the borrower's  ability to make monthly payments and the
value of the property  securing the loan. Most  properties  securing real estate
loans made by the Company are appraised by independent  fee appraisers  approved
by the Board of Directors. The Company generally requires borrowers to obtain an
attorney's  title opinion or title  insurance,  and fire and property  insurance
(including flood insurance,  if necessary) in an amount not less than the amount
of the loan.  Real estate loans  originated by the Company  generally  contain a
"due on sale"  clause  allowing  the  Company  to declare  the unpaid  principal
balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property.

                                       9

     Commercial  and  Multi-Family  Real  Estate  Lending.  The  Company is also
engaged in commercial and multi-family real estate lending in its primary market
area and  surrounding  areas  and has  purchased  whole  loan and  participation
interests in loans from other financial institutions. At September 30, 2002, the
Company's  commercial and multi-family real estate loan portfolio totaled $151.8
million,  or 42.7% of the Company's  total gross loan  portfolio.  The purchased
loans and loan  participation  interests  are  generally  secured by  properties
located in the Midwest and Northwest. See " - Originations, Purchases, Sales and
Servicing of Loans and  Mortgage-Backed  Securities."  The Company,  in order to
supplement  its loan portfolio and consistent  with  management's  objectives to
expand the Company's commercial and multi-family loan portfolio, purchased $24.5
million,  $24.0 million and $48.9 million of such loans during fiscal 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. At September 30, 2002, $417,000 or 0.3% of the Company's
commercial  and  multi-family  real estate loans were  non-performing.  See " --
Non-Performing Assets, Other Loans of Concern and Classified Assets."

     The Company's  commercial  and  multi-family  real estate loan portfolio is
secured   primarily   by   apartment   buildings,    nursing   homes,   assisted
living/retirement  facilities,  office  buildings  and  hotels.  Commercial  and
multi-family real estate loans generally have terms that do not exceed 20 years,
have  loan-to-value  ratios of up to 80% of the appraised  value of the security
property, and are typically secured by personal guarantees of the borrowers. The
Company  has a  variety  of rate  adjustment  features  and  other  terms in its
commercial  and  multi-family   real  estate  loan  portfolio.   Commercial  and
multi-family  real estate loans  provide for a margin over a number of different
indices.  In  underwriting  these  loans,  the Company  currently  analyzes  the
financial  condition of the borrower,  the borrower's  credit  history,  and the
reliability  and  predictability  of the cash  flow  generated  by the  property
securing the loan.  Appraisals on  properties  securing  commercial  real estate
loans originated by the Company are performed by independent appraisers.

     At September 30, 2002, the Company's  largest  commercial and  multi-family
real  estate loan was a $5.2  million  loan  secured by an assisted  living care
facility. The Company had thirteen other commercial and/or multi-family loans in
excess of $3.0 million at such date. All of these loans are currently performing
in accordance with their terms.  At September 30, 2002, the average  outstanding
principal  balance of a commercial or multi-family  real estate loan held by the
Company was $526,000.

     Multi-family  and commercial real estate loans  generally  present a higher
level of risk than loans secured by one- to four-family residences. This greater
risk is due to several  factors,  including the  concentration of principal in a
limited number of loans and borrowers, the effect of general economic conditions
on income  producing  properties and the increased  difficulty of evaluating and
monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore,  the repayment of loans secured by
multi-family  and  commercial  real  estate  is  typically  dependent  upon  the
successful  operation of the related real estate project.  If the cash flow from
the project is reduced (for example, if leases are not obtained or renewed, or a
bankruptcy  court  modifies a lease term, or a major tenant is unable to fulfill
its  lease  obligations),  the  borrower's  ability  to  repay  the  loan may be
impaired.

     Construction  Lending.  The Company makes construction loans to individuals
for  the  construction  of  their  residences  as well  as to  builders  for the
construction of one- to four-family  residences and commercial and  multi-family
real estate.  At September 30, 2002, the Company's  construction  loan portfolio
totaled $25.7 million, or 7.3% of the Company's total gross loan portfolio.

     Construction loans to individuals for their residences are structured to be
converted  to  permanent  loans  at the  end of the  construction  phase,  which
typically  runs up to twelve  months.  These  construction  loans have rates and
terms which generally  match the one- to four-family  loan rates then offered by
the  Company,  except  that  during the  construction  phase the  borrower  pays
interest  only.  Generally,  the maximum  loan-to-value  ratio of owner occupied
single  family  construction  loans  is  80%  of  appraised  value.  Residential

                                       10

<PAGE>


construction  loans are generally  underwritten  pursuant to the same guidelines
used for  originating  permanent  residential  loans. At September 30, 2002, the
Company had $1.1 million of construction loans to borrowers intending to live in
the properties upon completion of construction.

     Generally, construction loans to builders of one- to four-family residences
require the payment of interest only for up to 12 months and have terms of up to
12 months.  These loans may  provide  for the payment of interest  and loan fees
from loan proceeds and carry adjustable rates of interest.  Loan fees charged in
connection with the origination of such loans are generally 1%.

     Construction  loans on commercial and multi-family real estate projects may
be secured by  apartments,  agricultural  facilities,  small  office  buildings,
medical facilities,  assisted living facilities,  hotels or other property,  and
are generally  structured  to be converted to permanent  loans at the end of the
construction   phase,  which  generally  runs  up  to  18  months.   During  the
construction  phase the  borrower  pays  interest  only.  These loans  generally
provide  for the  payment  of  interest  and loan fees from  loan  proceeds.  At
September 30, 2002, the Company had approximately $24.6 million of loans for the
construction of commercial and multi-family  real estate.  This amount consisted
of one loan totaling  $5.0 million for the  construction  of an assisted  living
care facility,  two loans totaling $8.5 million for the  construction of hotels,
one loan totaling $2.0 million for the construction of an apartment complex, and
seven loans totaling $9.1 million for the construction of commercial facilities.
All of these loans were  performing in accordance  with their terms at September
30, 2002.

     Construction loans are obtained principally through continued business from
builders  who have  previously  borrowed  from  the  Company  and from  existing
customers who are building new facilities.  The application  process  includes a
submission  to the  Company  of  accurate  plans,  specifications,  costs of the
project to be constructed and projected  revenues from the project.  These items
are also  used as a basis  to  determine  the  appraised  value  of the  subject
property.  Loans are based on the lesser of the current  appraised  value of the
property or the cost of construction (land plus building).

     Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating  construction costs and
the market for the  project  upon  completion,  it is  relatively  difficult  to
evaluate  accurately  the total loan funds  required to complete a project,  the
related  loan-to-value  ratios and the  likelihood  of  ultimate  success of the
project. Construction loans to borrowers other than owner-occupants also involve
many of the same risks  discussed above  regarding  multi-family  and commercial
real estate loans and tend to be more sensitive to general  economic  conditions
than many other  types of loans.  Also,  the  funding of loan fees and  interest
during the  construction  phase  makes the  monitoring  of the  progress  of the
project  particularly  important,  as customary early warning signals of project
difficulties may not be present.

     Agricultural  Lending. The Company originates loans to finance the purchase
of farmland,  livestock, farm machinery and equipment,  seed, fertilizer and for
other farm related products. At September 30, 2002, the Company had agricultural
real estate loans  secured by farmland of $12.1 million or 3.4% of the Company's
gross loan portfolio.  At the same date, $25.3 million, or 7.1% of the Company's
gross loan  portfolio,  consisted  of  secured  loans  related  to  agricultural
operations.

     Agricultural  operating  loans are  originated  at either an  adjustable or
fixed rate of interest  for up to a one year term or, in the case of  livestock,
upon sale.  Most  agricultural  operating  loans have terms of one year or less.
Such loans provide for payments of principal and interest at least annually,  or
a lump sum payment  upon  maturity if the  original  term is less than one year.
Loans secured by agricultural  machinery are generally  originated as fixed-rate
loans with terms of up to seven  years.  At  September  30,  2002,  the  average
outstanding  principal  balance of an  agricultural  operating  loan held by the
Company was  $46,000.  At September  30, 2002,  $1.2  million,  or 4.3%,  of the
Company's agricultural operating loans were non-performing.

                                       11

<PAGE>


     Agricultural  real estate loans are frequently  originated  with adjustable
rates of interest.  Generally,  such loans  provide for a fixed rate of interest
for the  first  one to  five  years,  which  then  balloon  or  adjust  annually
thereafter.  In addition,  such loans generally amortize over a period of ten to
20 years.  Adjustable-rate  agricultural  real estate loans provide for a margin
over the yields on the  corresponding  U.S.  Treasury  Security  or prime  rate.
Fixed-rate agricultural real estate loans generally have terms up to five years.
Agricultural  real estate loans are generally limited to 75% of the value of the
property  securing  the loan.  At  September  30,  2002,  $41,000  or .3% of the
Company's agricultural real estate portfolio was non-performing.

     Agricultural  lending  affords the Company the  opportunity  to earn yields
higher  than  those  obtainable  on one-  to  four-family  residential  lending.
Nevertheless,  agricultural  lending involves a greater degree of risk than one-
to four-family  residential  mortgage loans because of the typically larger loan
amount. In addition, payments on loans are dependent on the successful operation
or management  of the farm property  securing the loan or for which an operating
loan is  utilized.  The success of the loan may also be affected by many factors
outside the control of the farm borrower.

     Weather  presents one of the greatest risks as hail,  drought,  floods,  or
other conditions, can severely limit crop yields and thus impair loan repayments
and the value of the  underlying  collateral.  This risk can be  reduced  by the
farmer  with a variety  of  insurance  coverages  which can help to ensure  loan
repayment.  Government  support programs and the Company  generally require that
farmers procure crop insurance coverage.

     Grain and livestock  prices also present a risk as prices may decline prior
to sale  resulting in a failure to cover  production  costs.  These risks may be
reduced by the farmer with the use of futures  contracts  or options to mitigate
price risk. The Company frequently requires borrowers to use future contracts or
options to reduce price risk and help ensure loan repayment.

     Another  risk  is  the   uncertainty  of  government   programs  and  other
regulations.  During periods of low commodity prices, the income from government
programs can be a significant  source of cash to make loan payments and if these
programs  are  discontinued  or  significantly  changed,  cash flow  problems or
defaults could result.

     Finally,  many farms are dependent on a limited  number of key  individuals
upon whose injury or death may result in an inability  to  successfully  operate
the farm.

     Consumer  Lending.  The Company offers a variety of secured consumer loans,
including automobile, boat, home equity, home improvement,  federally guaranteed
student loans, and loans secured by savings deposits.  In addition,  the Company
offers  other  secured and  unsecured  consumer  loans.  The  Company  currently
originates  substantially  all of its consumer  loans in its primary market area
and surrounding  areas. The Company  originates  consumer loans on both a direct
and indirect basis. At September 30, 2002, the Company's consumer loan portfolio
totaled  $23.6  million,  or 6.6% of its  total  gross  loan  portfolio.  Of the
consumer  loan   portfolio  at  September   30,  2002,   most  were  short-  and
intermediate-term, fixed-rate loans.

     The largest component of the Company's  consumer loan portfolio consists of
home equity loans and lines of credit.  Substantially  all of the Company's home
equity  loans and lines of credit are secured by second  mortgages  on principal
residences.  The Company will lend amounts which, together with all prior liens,
may be up to 100% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. Home
equity loans and lines of credit have  maximum  terms of up to 15 years and five
years, respectively.

                                       12

<PAGE>


     The Company  primarily  originates  automobile loans on a direct basis, but
also originates  indirect automobile loans on a very limited basis. Direct loans
are loans made when the Company  extends  credit  directly to the  borrower,  as
opposed  to  indirect  loans,  which are made when the  Company  purchases  loan
contracts,  often at a discount,  from  automobile  dealers  which have extended
credit  to  their  customers.  The  Company's  automobile  loans  typically  are
originated at fixed  interest  rates with terms up to 60 months for new and used
vehicles. Loans secured by automobiles are generally originated for up to 80% of
the N.A.D.A. book value of the automobile securing the loan.

     Consumer  loan terms vary  according  to the type and value of  collateral,
length of  contract  and  creditworthiness  of the  borrower.  The  underwriting
standards  employed by the Company for consumer loans include an application,  a
determination  of  the  applicant's  payment  history  on  other  debts  and  an
assessment of ability to meet existing  obligations and payments on the proposed
loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the
underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if
any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.

     Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential  mortgage
loans,  particularly  in the case of consumer  loans which are  unsecured or are
secured by rapidly  depreciable  assets,  such as  automobiles  or  recreational
equipment.  In such cases, any repossessed  collateral for a defaulted  consumer
loan may not provide an adequate  source of  repayment of the  outstanding  loan
balance as a result of the greater  likelihood of damage,  loss or depreciation.
In  addition,   consumer  loan  collections  are  dependent  on  the  borrower's
continuing  financial  stability,  and thus are more  likely to be  affected  by
adverse personal circumstances.  Furthermore, the application of various federal
and state laws,  including  bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount
which can be  recovered  on such  loans.  At  September  30,  2002,  none of the
Company's consumer loan portfolio was non-performing.

     Commercial  Business  Lending.  The  Company  also  originates   commercial
business  loans.  Most of the  Company's  commercial  business  loans  have been
extended to finance local and regional  businesses and include  short-term loans
to finance machinery and equipment purchases, inventory and accounts receivable.
Commercial   loans  also  involve  the  extension  of  revolving  credit  for  a
combination  of  equipment   acquisitions   and  working  capital  in  expanding
companies. At September 30, 2002, $42.8 million, or 12.1% of the Company's total
gross loan portfolio was comprised of commercial business loans.

     The maximum term for loans  extended on machinery and equipment is based on
the  projected  useful life of such  machinery  and  equipment.  Generally,  the
maximum  term on  non-mortgage  lines of credit is one year.  The  loan-to-value
ratio on such  loans and lines of credit  generally  may not  exceed  80% of the
value of the  collateral  securing the loan. The Company's  commercial  business
lending policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower's
character,  capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the  borrower's  capital
and  collateral as well as an  evaluation of conditions  affecting the borrower.
Analysis  of the  borrower's  past,  present  and  future  cash flows is also an
important  aspect of the Company's  current credit analysis.  Nonetheless,  such
loans  are  believed  to  carry  higher   credit  risk  than  more   traditional
investments.

     The largest commercial  business loan outstanding at September 30, 2002 was
a $7.3 million  warehouse line of credit secured  primarily by the assignment of
automobile  contracts and new and used automobiles.  The next largest commercial
business loan  outstanding at September 30, 2002 was a $4.1 million loan secured
by operating  assets used in the manufacture  and sale of commercial  insulation
systems.  The Company had six other  commercial  business  loans  outstanding in
excess of $1.0 million at September  30, 2002.  All of these loans are currently
performing in accordance  with their terms.  At September 30, 2002,  the average
outstanding  principal balance of a commercial business loan held by the Company
was $119,000.

     Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of
the  borrower's  ability to make  repayment from his or her employment and other
income  and which are  secured by real  property  whose  value  tends to be more
easily ascertainable,  commercial business loans typically are made on the basis
of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's
business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial
business  loans may be  substantially  dependent  on the success of the business
itself  (which,  in turn,  is likely to be dependent  upon the general  economic
environment).  The  Company's  commercial  business  loans are usually,  but not
always,  secured  by  business  assets and  personal  guarantees.  However,  the
collateral  securing  the loans may  depreciate  over time,  may be difficult to
appraise  and may  fluctuate in value based on the success of the  business.  At
September 30, 2002,  $408,000 or 1.0% of the Company's  commercial business loan
portfolio was non-performing.

Originations,  Purchases,  Sales  and  Servicing  of Loans  and  Mortgage-Backed
Securities

     Loans are  generally  originated  by the  Company's  staff of salaried loan
officers. Loan applications are taken and processed in the branches and the main
office of the Company.  While the Company  originates both  adjustable-rate  and
fixed-rate  loans, its ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative
customer demand for loans in its market. Demand is affected by the interest rate
and economic environment.

     The Company,  from time to time, sells whole loans and loan  participations
generally  without  recourse.  At  September  30,  2002,  there  were  no  loans
outstanding  sold  with  recourse.  When  loans are sold the  Company  typically
retains the  responsibility  for collecting and remitting loan payments,  making
certain  that real  estate tax  payments  are made on behalf of  borrowers,  and
otherwise  servicing  the loans.  The servicing fee is recognized as income over
the life of the loans.  The Company  services  loans that it originated and sold
totaling  $40.3  million at September 30, 2002, of which $18.1 million were sold
to Fannie Mae and $22.2 million were sold to others.

     In periods of economic  uncertainty,  the  Company's  ability to  originate
large dollar volumes of loans may be substantially reduced or restricted, with a
resultant  decrease  in  related  loan  origination  fees,  other fee income and
operating  earnings.  In  addition,  the  Company's  ability  to sell  loans may
substantially  decrease as potential buyers  (principally  government  agencies)
reduce their purchasing activities.

     At September  30, 2002,  approximately  $107.3  million,  or 30.2%,  of the
Company's  gross loan  portfolio  consisted  of  purchased  loans.  The  Company
believes that  purchasing  loans secured by real estate  located  outside of its
market area assists the Company in diversifying its portfolio and may lessen the
adverse  affects on the Company's  business or operations  which could result in

                                       15

the event of a downturn or weakening  of the local  economy in which the Company
conducts  its  operations.   However,   additional  risks  are  associated  with
purchasing  loans secured by real estate  outside of the Company's  market area,
including the lack of knowledge of the local real estate  market and  difficulty
in monitoring and inspecting the property securing the loans.

     The following table provides information regarding the Company's balance of
wholly purchased real estate loans and real estate loan  participations for each
state in which the balance of such loans  exceeded $1.0 million at September 30,
2002.  Not included in the  following  table are purchased  commercial  business
loans  totaling  $1.4  million,  approximately  88% of which are  located in the
Company's market area.

Non-Performing Assets, Other Loans of Concern, and Classified Assets

     When a borrower  fails to make a required  payment on real  estate  secured
loans and  consumer  loans  within 16 days after the payment is due, the Company
generally institutes  collection procedures by mailing a delinquency notice. The
customer is contacted again, by written notice or telephone,  before the payment
is 45  days  past  due and  again  before  75  days  past  due.  In most  cases,
delinquencies  are cured  promptly;  however,  if a loan has been delinquent for
more than 90 days,  satisfactory  payment arrangements must be adhered to or the
Company will initiate foreclosure or repossession.

     Generally,  when a loan  becomes  delinquent  90 days  or more or when  the
collection of principal or interest becomes doubtful, the Company will place the
                                       16

<PAGE>


loan on a  non-accrual  status and,  as a result,  previously  accrued  interest
income on the loan is taken out of  current  income.  The loan will  remain on a
non-accrual status until the loan becomes current.

     The following  table sets forth the Company's loan  delinquencies  by type,
before  allowance  for loan  losses,  by  amount  and by  percentage  of type at

     The table  below sets forth the amounts and  categories  of  non-performing
assets  in the  Company's  loan  portfolio.  Loans,  with some  exceptions,  are
typically  placed on  non-accrual  status when the loan  becomes 90 days or more
delinquent or when the collection of principal  and/or interest become doubtful.
For all years  presented,  the  Company's  troubled debt  restructurings  (which
involved  forgiving a portion of interest  or  principal  on any loans or making
loans at a rate  materially  less than that of market rates) are included in the
table and were performing as agreed.

     For the year ended  September 30, 2002,  gross interest  income which would
have been recorded had the  non-accruing  loans been current in accordance  with
their  original  terms  amounted to  approximately  $404,000,  of which none was
included in interest income.

     Non-accruing  Loans. At September 30, 2002, the Company had $1.3 million in
non-accruing   loans,  which  constituted  .37%  of  the  Company's  gross  loan
portfolio.  At  such  date,  there  were  no  non-accruing  loans  or  aggregate
non-accruing loans to one borrower in excess of $500,000 in net book value.

     Accruing Loans Delinquent 90 Days or More. At September 30, 2002,  accruing
loans delinquent 90 days or more included a $804,000  agricultural  loan secured

                                       18

by agricultural real estate, machinery and crops. The Company is well secured on
this loan and anticipates collecting all principal and accrued interest.

     Other Loans of Concern.  At September 30, 2002,  there were loans  totaling
$11.5 million not included in the table above where known  information about the
possible  credit problems of borrowers  caused  management to have concern as to
the ability of the  borrower to comply with the present  loan  repayment  terms.
This amount  consisted of two one- to  four-family  residential  mortgage  loans
totaling  $72,000,  three  commercial  business loans totaling  $100,000,  seven
agricultural  operating loans totaling $1.9 million,  twenty-nine consumer loans
totaling $186,000 and four commercial real estate loans totaling $9.1 million.

     Commercial  real estate loans of concern at September  30, 2002  included a
$4.1  million  participation  loan  secured by a hotel  located in Federal  Way,
Washington.  A slow  down in the  travel  industry  after  9/11  contributed  to
delinquency  issues with this loan during fiscal 2002. The travel industry is in
process of recovering  from this slow down and the loan was current at September
30, 2002.

     Also included in  commercial  real estate loans of concern at September 30,
2002 was a $3.0 million  participation  loan secured by an assisted  living care
facility located in Federal Way, Washington. At September 30, 2002, the loan was
60 days delinquent due primarily to declining occupancy as a result of increased
competition in the area. The borrower has focused on increasing  occupancy rates
and, subsequent to September 30, 2002, the loan was brought current.

     Classified Assets.  Federal  regulations  provide for the classification of
loans and other  assets  such as debt and equity  securities  considered  by the
Office  of  Thrift   Supervision   (the  "OTS")  to  be  of  lesser  quality  as
"substandard,"  "doubtful" or "loss." An asset is considered "substandard" if it
is  inadequately  protected by the current net worth and paying  capacity of the
obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. "Substandard" assets include those
characterized by the "distinct  possibility"  that the savings  association will
sustain "some loss" if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as
"doubtful"   have  all  of  the   weaknesses   inherent   in  those   classified
"substandard,"  with the added  characteristic  that the weaknesses present make
"collection or liquidation in full," on the basis of currently  existing  facts,
conditions,  and values, "highly questionable and improbable." Assets classified
as "loss" are those  considered  "uncollectible"  and of such minimal value that
their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve
is  not   warranted.   The  loans  held  by  Security  are  subject  to  similar
classification by its regulatory authorities.

     When assets are classified as either substandard or doubtful,  the Bank may
establish  general  allowances  for loan losses in an amount  deemed  prudent by
management.  General  allowances  represent  loss  allowances  which  have  been
established to recognize the inherent risk associated  with lending  activities,
but which,  unlike  specific  allowances,  have not been allocated to particular
problem  assets.  When  assets are  classified  as "loss,"  the Bank is required
either to  establish  a  specific  allowance  for  losses  equal to 100% of that
portion of the asset so  classified  or to  charge-off  such amount.  The Banks'
determinations as to the  classification of their assets and the amount of their
valuation allowances are subject to review by their regulatory authorities,  who
may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.

     On the basis of management's  review of its assets,  at September 30, 2002,
the  Company  had  classified  a  total  of  $13.5  million  of  its  assets  as
substandard, $114,000 as doubtful and none as loss.

     Allowance for Loan Losses.  The  allowance  for loan losses is  established
through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the risk
inherent in its loan  portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan
activity,  including  those  loans  which are being  specifically  monitored  by

                                       19

<PAGE>

management.  Such  evaluation,  which  includes a review of loans for which full
collectibility may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, the
estimated  fair  value  of  the  underlying  collateral,   economic  conditions,
historical  loan loss  experience and other factors that warrant  recognition in
providing for an adequate loan loss allowance.

     Current  economic  conditions in the  agricultural  sector of the Company's
market area are stable due to generally  higher commodity  prices.  Price levels
for grain crops and  livestock  have improved in recent months and are currently
at levels that present minimal concern.  The agricultural  economy is accustomed
to  commodity  price   fluctuations   and  is  generally  able  to  handle  such
fluctuations without significant  problem.  Although the Company underwrites its
agricultural  loans based on the current level of commodity  prices, an extended
period of low commodity  prices or adverse  growing  conditions  could result in
weakness in the  agricultural  loan  portfolio  and could  create a need for the
Company to increase its allowance for loan losses through  increased  charges to
provision for loan losses.

     Real estate  properties  acquired  through  foreclosure are recorded at the
lower of cost or fair value.  If fair value at the date of  foreclosure is lower
than the balance of the related loan, the difference  will be charged-off to the
allowance for loan losses at the time of transfer.  Valuations are  periodically
updated by management and if the value declines, a specific provision for losses
on such property is established by a charge to operations.

     Although management believes that it uses the best information available to
determine  the  allowances,   unforeseen   market  conditions  could  result  in
adjustments and net earnings could be  significantly  affected if  circumstances
differ   substantially   from  the   assumptions   used  in  making   the  final
determination.  Future additions to the Company's  allowances will be the result
of periodic loan,  property and collateral  reviews and thus cannot be predicted
in advance.

     The following  table sets forth an analysis of the Company's  allowance for
loan losses.

     Mortgage-Backed  Securities.  The  Company's  mortgage-backed  and  related
securities  portfolio  consists of securities issued under  government-sponsored
agency programs,  including those of Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The
Company also holds Collateralized  Mortgage Obligations  ("CMOs"),  as well as a
limited  amount of privately  issued  mortgage  pass-through  certificates.  The
Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  certificates  are modified  pass-through
mortgage-backed  securities  that  represent  undivided  interests in underlying
pools  of  fixed-rate,  or  certain  types  of  adjustable-rate,   predominantly
single-family and, to a lesser extent, multi-family residential mortgages issued
by these  government-sponsored  entities.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  generally
provide the  certificate  holder a  guarantee  of timely  payments of  interest,
whether  or not  collected.  Ginnie  Mae's  guarantee  to the  holder  is timely
payments of principal and  interest,  backed by the full faith and credit of the
U.S. Government.  Privately issued mortgage pass-through  certificates generally
provide no guarantee as to timely payment of interest or principal, and reliance
is placed on the creditworthiness of the issuer, which the Company monitors on a
regular basis.

     CMOs  are  special  types  of  pass-through  debt in which  the  stream  of
principal and interest payments on the underlying  mortgages or  mortgage-backed
securities  is used to create  classes with  different  maturities  and, in some
cases,  amortization  schedules,  as well as a residual interest, with each such
class  possessing  different  risk  characteristics.  At September 30, 2002, the
Company  held  CMOs  totaling  $43.3  million,  all of  which  were  secured  by
underlying  collateral  issued  under  government-sponsored  agency  programs or
residential real estate mortgage loans. Premiums associated with the purchase of
these  CMOs  are not  significant,  therefore,  the  risk of  significant  yield
adjustments because of accelerated prepayments is limited. Yield adjustments are
encountered as interest rates rise or decline,  which in turn slows or increases
prepayment rates and affect the average lives of the CMOs.

     At  September  30,  2002,   $191.4   million  or  99.5%  of  the  Company's
mortgage-backed securities portfolio had fixed rates of interest and $971,000 or
0.5% of such portfolio had adjustable rates of interest.

     Mortgage-backed  securities generally increase the quality of the Company's
assets by virtue of the insurance or guarantees  that back them, are more liquid
than individual  mortgage loans and may be used to  collateralize  borrowings or

                                       24

other obligations of the Company. At September 30, 2002, $172.9 million or 89.9%
of the  Company's  mortgage-backed  securities  were  pledged to secure  various
obligations of the Company.

     While mortgage-backed securities carry a reduced credit risk as compared to
whole  loans,  such  securities  remain  subject to the risk that a  fluctuating
interest  rate  environment,  along with other  factors  such as the  geographic
distribution of the underlying  mortgage loans, may alter the prepayment rate of
such mortgage loans and so affect both the prepayment  speed, and value, of such
securities.  The prepayment risk associated with  mortgage-backed  securities is
monitored periodically,  and prepayment rate assumptions adjusted as appropriate
to   update   the   Company's   mortgage-backed    securities   accounting   and
asset/liability  reports.   Classification  of  the  Company's   mortgage-backed
securities portfolio as available for sale is designed to minimize that risk.

     The  following  table  sets  forth  the  carrying  value  of the  Company's
mortgage-backed securities at the dates indicated.

(1)  This security is rated Aaa by a nationally recognized rating agency.

     At September  30,  2002,  the  contractual  maturity of 39.5% of all of the
Company's  mortgage-backed  securities  was in excess of ten  years.  The actual

                                       25

<PAGE>

maturity  of a  mortgage-backed  security  is  typically  less  than its  stated
maturity due to scheduled  principal  payments and prepayments of the underlying
mortgages. Prepayments that are different than anticipated will affect the yield
to maturity. The yield is based upon the interest income and the amortization of
any premium or discount related to the mortgage-backed  security.  In accordance
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  premiums and  discounts  are
amortized  over the estimated  lives of the loans,  which  decrease and increase
interest income, respectively.  The prepayment assumptions used to determine the
amortization  period for premiums and  discounts  can  significantly  affect the
yield of the  mortgage-backed  security,  and  these  assumptions  are  reviewed
periodically to reflect actual prepayments.  Although  prepayments of underlying
mortgages  depend on many factors,  including the type of mortgages,  the coupon
rate, the age of mortgages,  the  geographical  location of the underlying  real
estate  collateralizing  the  mortgages  and general  levels of market  interest
rates, the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and
the  prevailing  mortgage  interest  rates  generally  is the  most  significant
determinant  of the rate of  prepayments.  During  periods of  falling  mortgage
interest  rates,  if the coupon  rate of the  underlying  mortgages  exceeds the
prevailing  market  interest  rates  offered  for  mortgage  loans,  refinancing
generally  increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying  mortgages
and the related security.  Under such circumstances,  the Company may be subject
to  reinvestment  risk because to the extent that the Company's  mortgage-backed
securities  amortize or prepay faster than  anticipated,  the Company may not be
able to reinvest the proceeds of such repayments and prepayments at a comparable
rate.

Sources of Funds

     General.   The  Company's  sources  of  funds  are  deposits,   borrowings,
amortization  and repayment of loan principal,  interest earned on or maturation
of investment  securities  and short-term  investments,  and funds provided from
operations.

     Borrowings,  including  Federal  Home Loan Bank  ("FHLB") of Des Moines and
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago ("FRB") advances,  reverse repurchase agreements
and  retail  repurchase  agreements,  may be used at  times  to  compensate  for
seasonal  reductions  in  deposits  or deposit  inflows  at less than  projected
levels,  may  be  used  on a  longer-term  basis  to  support  expanded  lending
activities, and may also be used to match the funding of a corresponding asset.

     Deposits.  The Company offers a variety of deposit  accounts  having a wide
range of interest rates and terms.  The Company's  deposits  consist of passbook
savings  accounts,  money  market  savings  accounts,  NOW and regular  checking
accounts, and certificate accounts currently ranging in terms from fourteen days
to 60 months.  The Company only solicits  deposits from its primary  market area
and does not  currently  use  brokers to obtain  deposits.  The  Company  relies
primarily on competitive  pricing policies,  advertising and customer service to
attract and retain these deposits.

     The flow of  deposits  is  influenced  significantly  by  general  economic
conditions,   changes  in  money  market  and  prevailing  interest  rates,  and
competition.

     The variety of deposit accounts offered by the Company has allowed it to be
competitive  in obtaining  funds and to respond with  flexibility  to changes in
consumer  demand.   The  Company  has  become  more  susceptible  to  short-term
fluctuations  in deposit  flows,  as customers  have become more  interest  rate
conscious.  The  Company  endeavors  to manage the  pricing of its  deposits  in
keeping with its asset/liability management and profitability objectives.  Based
on its experience,  the Company believes that its passbook savings, money market
savings  accounts,  NOW and regular  checking  accounts  are  relatively  stable
sources of deposits. However, the ability of the Company to attract and maintain
certificates  of deposit and the rates paid on these  deposits has been and will
continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.

(1)  Includes  deposits from  governmental  and other public  entities  totaling
     $19.4 million.

     Borrowings.  Although  deposits are the Company's  primary source of funds,
the Company's policy has been to utilize  borrowings when they are a less costly
source of funds, can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, or when the
Company desires additional capacity to fund loan demand.

     The Company's  borrowings  historically have consisted of advances from the
FHLB of Des Moines upon the  security  of a blanket  collateral  agreement  of a
percentage  of  unencumbered  loans  and  the  pledge  of  specific   investment
securities.  Such  advances  can be made  pursuant to several  different  credit
programs,  each of which has its own interest rate and range of  maturities.  At
September 30, 2002,  the Company had $125.1 million of advances from the FHLB of
Des  Moines  and the  ability to borrow up to an  approximate  additional  $73.1

                                       28

million.  At September  30, 2002,  advances  totaling  $5.2 million had terms to
maturity  of one year or less.  The  remaining  $119.9  million  had  maturities
ranging up to 18 years.

     On July 16, 2001, the Company issued all of the 10,000 authorized shares of
Company Obligated  Mandatorily  Redeemable Preferred Securities of First Midwest
Financial  Capital Trust I (preferred  securities of subsidiary  trust)  holding
solely  subordinated  debt  securities.  Distributions  are paid  semi-annually.
Cumulative  cash  distributions  are  calculated at a variable rate of LIBOR (as
defined) plus 3.75%, not to exceed 12.5%. The Company may, at one or more times,
defer  interest  payments on the  capital  securities  for up to 10  consecutive
semi-annual  periods,  but not beyond July 25, 2031.  At the end of any deferral
period,  all  accumulated  and unpaid  distributions  will be paid.  The capital
securities  will be  redeemed  on July 25,  2031;  however,  the Company has the
option to shorten the  maturity  date to a date not earlier  than July 25, 2006.
The redemption  price is $1,000 per capital security plus any accrued and unpaid
distributions  to the date of  redemption  plus,  if redeemed  prior to July 25,
2011, a redemption premium as defined in the Indenture Agreement. Holders of the
capital  securities  have no voting  rights,  are  unsecured  and rank junior in
priority  of  payment  to all of the  Company's  indebtedness  and senior to the
Company's common stock.

     From time to time, the Company has offered retail repurchase  agreements to
its customers.  These  agreements  typically range from 14 days to five years in
term,  and  typically  have been  offered in minimum  amounts of  $100,000.  The
proceeds of these  transactions are used to meet cash flow needs of the Company.
At  September  30,  2002,  the  Company  had $1.3  million of retail  repurchase
agreements outstanding.

     Historically,  the Company has entered into reverse  repurchase  agreements
through  nationally   recognized   broker-dealer  firms.  These  agreements  are
accounted  for as  borrowings  by the  Company and are secured by certain of the
Company's  investment and  mortgage-backed  securities.  The broker-dealer takes
possession  of the  securities  during the period  that the  reverse  repurchase
agreement is outstanding. The terms of the agreements have typically ranged from
7 days to a maximum of six months.  At September 30, 2002, the Company had $68.9
million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding.

     The following table sets forth the maximum month-end balance and average
balance of FHLB advances, retail and reverse repurchase agreements and Preferred
Securities of Subsidiary Trust for the periods indicated.

Subsidiary Activities

     The only  subsidiaries  of the Company are First Federal,  Security,  First
Services  Trust  Company  and First  Midwest  Financial  Capital  Trust I. First
Federal has one service  subsidiary,  First Services  Financial  Limited ("First
Services").  At  September  30,  2002,  the net book  value  of First  Federal's
investment in First Services was approximately $118,000.  Security does not have
any  subsidiaries.  First Federal  organized  First  Services,  its sole service
corporation,  in 1983.  First Services is located in Storm Lake, Iowa and offers
mutual funds, equities, bonds, insurance products and annuities.  First Services
recognized a net loss of $33,000 during fiscal 2002.

Regulation

     General.  Bank holding  companies,  such as First  Midwest,  are subject to
comprehensive  regulation by the FRB under the BHCA and the  regulations  of the
FRB. As a bank holding  company,  First Midwest is required to file reports with
the FRB and such additional  information as the FRB may require,  and is subject
to  regular  inspections  by the FRB.  The FRB also  has  extensive  enforcement
authority  over bank  holding  companies,  including,  among other  things,  the
ability to assess  civil money  penalties,  to issue cease and desist or removal
orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries  (including its
bank  subsidiaries).  In  general,  enforcement  actions  may be  initiated  for
violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.

     Under FRB policy, a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength
for its  subsidiary  banks.  Under  this  policy  the FRB may  require a holding
company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank.

     Under the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain FRB approval before: (i)
acquiring, directly or indirectly,  ownership or control of any voting shares of
another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or
control  more than 5% of such shares  (unless it already  owns or  controls  the
majority of such shares);  (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets
of another bank or bank holding company;  or (iii) merging or consolidating with
another bank holding company.

                                       30

<PAGE>


     The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company,  with certain  exceptions,  from
acquiring direct or indirect  ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting
shares  of any  company  which is not a bank or bank  holding  company,  or from
engaging  directly  or  indirectly  in  activities  other than those of banking,
managing or controlling banks, or providing  services for its subsidiaries.  The
principal  exceptions to these prohibitions  involve certain non-bank activities
which,  by  statute  or by FRB  regulation  or order,  have been  identified  as
activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling
banks. The list of activities permitted by the FRB includes, among other things,
operating  a savings  institution  (such as First  Federal),  mortgage  company,
finance company,  credit card company or factoring  company;  performing certain
data processing  operations;  providing certain investment and financial advice;
underwriting   and  acting  as  an   insurance   agent  for  certain   types  of
credit-related  insurance;  leasing  property  on a  full-payout,  non-operating
basis;  real estate and personal  property  appraising;  and, subject to certain
limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. The scope of
permissible  activities  may be  expanded  from  time to time by the  FRB.  Such
activities may also be affected by federal legislation.

     First Midwest currently has four wholly-owned subsidiaries,  First Federal,
a federally-chartered thrift institution, Security, an Iowa-chartered commercial
bank,  First  Midwest  Financial  Capital  Trust I, a statutory  business  trust
organized  under  the  Delaware  Business  Trust Act and  First  Services  Trust
Company, a South Dakota corporation that provides trust services.  First Federal
is subject to extensive  regulation,  supervision and examination by the OTS, as
its  chartering  authority  and primary  federal  regulator,  and by the Federal
Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (the "FDIC"),  which insures its deposits up to
applicable  limits.  First Federal is a member of the FHLB System and is subject
to certain  limited  regulation  by the FRB.  Such  regulation  and  supervision
governs  the  activities  in which an  institution  can engage and the manner in
which  such  activities  are  conducted,  and  is  intended  primarily  for  the
protection  of the  insurance  fund  and  depositors.  Security  is  subject  to
extensive regulation,  supervision and examination by the Iowa Superintendent of
Banking  (the  "ISB")  and the FRB,  which  are its state  and  primary  federal
regulators,  respectively.  It is also subject to regulation by the FDIC,  which
insures its  deposits  up to  applicable  limits.  As with First  Federal,  such
regulation and  supervision  governs the activities in which Security can engage
and the manner in which such activities are conducted and is intended  primarily
for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.

     First  Midwest is  regulated  as a bank  holding  company by the FRB.  Bank
holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by the
FRB under the Bank Holding  Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA") and the
regulations  of the FRB. As a bank  holding  company,  First  Midwest  must file
reports with the FRB and such additional information as the FRB may require, and
is subject to regular  inspections  by the FRB.  First Midwest is subject to the
activity  limitations  imposed  under the BHCA and in general may engage in only
those activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking.

     Regulatory authorities have been granted extensive discretion in connection
with  their  supervisory  and  enforcement  activities  which  are  intended  to
strengthen  the  financial  condition  of the banking  industry,  including  the
imposition   of   restrictions   on  the  operation  of  an   institution,   the
classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution's
allowance  for loan  losses.  Any  change in the nature of such  regulation  and
oversight,  whether by the OTS, the FDIC, the FRB or  legislatively by Congress,
could have a material  impact on First  Midwest,  First  Federal or Security and
their respective operations.

     Certain of these  regulatory  requirements  and  restrictions are discussed
below or elsewhere in this document.

                                       31

<PAGE>


     Federal  Regulation  of  Financial  Institutions.  The  OTS  has  extensive
supervisory   and   regulatory   authority   over  the   operations  of  savings
associations.  As part of this  authority,  First  Federal is  required  to file
periodic reports with the OTS and is subject to periodic  examination by the OTS
and the FDIC.  The last  regular  OTS  examination  of First  Federal  was as of
December 28, 2001.  Security is subject to similar  regulation  and oversight by
the ISB and the FRB and was last examined as of April 15, 2002.

     Each  federal  and  state  banking  regulator  has  extensive   enforcement
authority over its regulated institutions.  This enforcement authority includes,
among other things,  the power to compel higher reserves,  the ability to assess
civil  money  penalties,  to issue  cease-and-desist  or  removal  orders and to
initiate  injunctive  actions.  In  general,  these  enforcement  actions may be
initiated  for  violations  of  laws  and  regulations  and  unsafe  or  unsound
practices.  Other  actions or  inactions  may provide the basis for  enforcement
action,   including  misleading  or  untimely  reports.   Except  under  certain
circumstances,  public disclosure of final enforcement  actions by the regulator
is required.

     In  addition,  the  investment,  lending and  branching  authority of First
Federal is prescribed by federal laws and it is prohibited  from engaging in any
activities not permitted by such laws.  Security is subject to such restrictions
under state law as administered by the ISB.  Federal  savings  associations  are
generally authorized to branch nationwide, whereas Iowa chartered banks, such as
Security,  are limited to establishing branches in the counties contiguous to or
cornering upon the county where their home office is located.

     Both First Federal's and Security's  general  permissible  lending limit to
one  borrower is equal to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of  unimpaired  capital
and  surplus  (except  for loans  fully  secured by certain  readily  marketable
collateral,  in which case this limit is increased to 25% of unimpaired  capital
and  surplus).  Security is subject to similar  restrictions.  At September  30,
2002, First Federal's and Security's  lending limit under these restrictions was
$7.2  million and  $978,000,  respectively.  First  Federal and  Security are in
compliance with their lending limits.

     Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. First Federal is a member
of the Savings Association  Insurance Fund (the "SAIF") and Security is a member
of the Bank Insurance  Fund (the "BIF"),  each of which is  administered  by the
FDIC.  Deposits  are  insured  up to  applicable  limits  by the  FDIC  and such
insurance  is  backed  by  the  full  faith  and  credit  of the  United  States
Government.  As insurer,  the FDIC  imposes  deposit  insurance  premiums and is
authorized to conduct  examinations of and to require  reporting by FDIC-insured
institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in
any activity the FDIC  determines  by regulation or order to pose a serious risk
to the SAIF or the BIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate  enforcement
actions  against any FDIC insured  institution  after giving its primary federal
regulator  the  opportunity  to take such action,  and may terminate the deposit
insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound
practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.

     The FDIC's  deposit  insurance  premiums are assessed  through a risk-based
system under which all insured  depository  institutions  are placed into one of
nine  categories  and  assessed  insurance  premiums  based upon their  level of
capital and supervisory evaluation. The current assessment rates range from zero
to .27% per $100 of  assessable  deposits.  Risk  classification  of all insured
institutions  will be made by the FDIC for each semi-annual  assessment  period.
Institutions that are  well-capitalized  and have a high supervisory  rating are
subject to the lowest  assessment  rate.  At September  30, 2002,  each of First
Federal  and  Security  met the  capital  requirements  of a "well  capitalized"
institution  and were not  subject  to any  assessment.  See Note 13 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

     Regulatory Capital Requirements.  Federally insured financial institutions,
such as First Federal and Security,  are required to maintain a minimum level of
regulatory  capital.  These  capital  requirements  mandate that an  institution

                                       32
<PAGE>


maintain  at least  the  following  ratios:  (1) a core (or Tier 1)  capital  to
adjusted  total  assets ratio of 4% (which can be reduced to 3% for highly rated
institutions);  (2) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4% and (3)
a risk-based capital to risk-weighted  assets ratio of 8%. Capital  requirements
in excess of these  standards  may be imposed on  individual  institutions  on a
case-by-case basis. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
the Annual Report.

     An FDIC-insured  institution's primary federal regulator is also authorized
and, under certain  circumstances  required,  to take certain actions against an
"undercapitalized  institution"  (generally  defined  to be one with  less  than
either a 4% core capital ratio, a 4% Tier 1 risked-based  capital ratio or an 8%
risk-based   capital  ratio).   Any  such  institution  must  submit  a  capital
restoration plan and until such plan is approved by the OTS may not increase its
assets,  acquire  another  institution,  establish a branch or engage in any new
activities,  and  generally  may not make  capital  distributions.  The  primary
federal  regulator is also authorized,  and with respect to institution's  whose
capital is further depleted, required to impose additional restrictions that can
affect all aspects of the institution's operations, including the appointment of
a receiver for a "critically  undercapitalized"  institution  (i.e.,  one with a
tangible  capital  ratio of 2% or less).  As a condition  to the approval of the
capital   restoration   plan,  any  company   controlling  an   undercapitalized
institution  must agree that it will  enter into a limited  capital  maintenance
guarantee  with  respect  to  the  institution's   achievement  of  its  capital
requirements.

     Though not  anticipated,  the  imposition of any of these measures on First
Federal  or  Security  may  have  a  substantial  adverse  effect  on  Company's
operations and profitability.  First Midwest shareholders do not have preemptive
rights,  and therefore,  if First Midwest is directed by the OTS, the FRB or the
FDIC to issue additional shares of Common Stock, such issuance may result in the
dilution in shareholders percentage of ownership of First Midwest.

     Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital  Distributions.  The OTS imposes
various  restrictions on savings  associations  with respect to their ability to
make  distributions of capital,  which include  dividends,  stock redemptions or
repurchases,  cash-out  mergers  and other  transactions  charged to the capital
account.  The OTS also prohibits a savings  association from declaring or paying
any  dividends  or from  repurchasing  any of its  stock if, as a result of such
action,  the regulatory  capital of the  association  would be reduced below the
amount  required to be maintained  for the  liquidation  account  established in
connection with the association's mutual to stock conversion.

     Savings  institutions such as First Federal may make a capital distribution
without the  approval of the OTS,  provided  they notify the OTS 30-days  before
they declare the capital distribution and they meet the following  requirements:
(i) have a regulatory rating in one of the two top examination categories,  (ii)
are not of supervisory concern, and will remain adequately- or well-capitalized,
as  defined in the OTS  prompt  corrective  action  regulations,  following  the
proposed  distribution,  and (iii) the  distribution  does not exceed  their net
income for the calendar  year-to-date  plus retained net income for the previous
two  calendar  years  (less  any  dividends   previously  paid).  If  a  savings
institution  does not meet the above  stated  requirements,  it must  obtain the
prior approval of the OTS before declaring any proposed distributions.

     Security may pay dividends,  in cash or property, only out of its undivided
profits.  In addition,  FRB  regulations  prohibit the payment of dividends by a
state  member bank if losses have at any time been  sustained  by such bank that
equal or  exceed  its  undivided  profits  then on hand,  unless  (i) the  prior
approval of the FRB has been obtained and (ii) at least two-thirds of the shares
of each class of stock  outstanding  have  approved  the dividend  payment.  FRB
regulations  also  prohibit  the payment of any  dividend by a state member bank
without the prior approval of the FRB if the total of all dividends  declared by

                                       33

<PAGE>

the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year
combined with its retained net profits of the previous two calendar years (minus
any  required  transfers  to a surplus  or to a fund for the  retirement  of any
preferred stock).

     Qualified  Thrift Lender Test. All savings  associations,  including  First
Federal,  are required to meet a qualified  thrift lender  ("QTL") test to avoid
certain  restrictions  on  their  operations.   This  test  requires  a  savings
association  to have  at  least  65% of its  portfolio  assets  (as  defined  by
regulation) in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of
every 12 months  on a  rolling  basis or meet the  requirements  for a  domestic
building and loan  association  under the Internal  Revenue  Code.  Under either
test, the required assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans
and  investments.  At  September  30, 2002,  First  Federal met the test and has
always met the test since its effectiveness.

     Any savings  association  that fails to meet the QTL test must convert to a
national  bank  charter,  unless it  requalifies  as a QTL  within  one year and
thereafter  remains a QTL, or limits its new investments and activities to those
permissible for both a savings association and a national bank. In addition, the
association  is subject to national  bank limits for  payment of  dividends  and
branching  authority.  If such association has not requalified or converted to a
national  bank  within  three  years  after the  failure,  it must divest of all
investments and cease all activities not permissible for a national bank.

     Community  Reinvestment Act. Under the Community  Reinvestment Act ("CRA"),
every FDIC insured  institution  has a  continuing  and  affirmative  obligation
consistent  with safe and sound banking  practices to help meet the credit needs
of its entire community,  including low and moderate income  neighborhoods.  The
CRA does not establish  specific lending  requirements or programs for financial
institutions nor does it limit an institution's  discretion to develop the types
of products  and  services  that it believes  are best suited to its  particular
community,  consistent  with the CRA.  The CRA  requires the OTS and the FRB, in
connection with the examination of First Federal and Security,  respectively, to
assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and
to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications, such
as  a  merger  or  the  establishment  of  a  branch,  by  the  institution.  An
unsatisfactory  rating  may be  used as the  basis  for  the  denial  of such an
application.  First Federal was examined for CRA  compliance in January 2002 and
Security was examined in June 1999 and both received a rating of "satisfactory."

Bank Holding Company Regulation

     Interstate Banking and Branching.  The FRB may approve an application of an
adequately  capitalized  and adequately  managed bank holding company to acquire
control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located
in a state  other than such  holding  company's  home state,  without  regard to
whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state.  The FRB may not
approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum
time period (not  exceeding  five years)  specified by the  statutory law of the
host  state or if the  applicant  (and its  depository  institution  affiliates)
controls or would  control  more than 10% of the insured  deposits in the United
States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target  bank's home state or in any
state in which the target bank maintains a branch.  Iowa has adopted a five year
minimum existence requirement.  States are authorized to limit the percentage of
total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank or
bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against
out-of-state banks or bank holding  companies.  Individual states may also waive
the 30% state-wide concentration limit.

     The federal  banking  agencies  are also  generally  authorized  to approve
interstate  merger  transactions  without regard to whether such  transaction is
prohibited by the law of any state.  Interstate  acquisitions of branches or the
establishment of a new branch is permitted only if the law of the state in which
the branch is located permits such  acquisitions.  Interstate mergers and branch
acquisitions  are also subject to the nationwide and statewide  insured  deposit
concentration amounts described above. Iowa permits interstate branching only by
merger.
                                       34

<PAGE>


     Holding  Company  Dividends.  The FRB has issued a policy  statement on the
payment of cash dividends by bank holding  companies,  which expresses the FRB's
view that a bank holding  company  should pay cash  dividends only to the extent
that its net  income  for the past  year is  sufficient  to cover  both the cash
dividends and a rate of earning  retention  that is consistent  with the holding
company's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.  The FRB
also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious
financial  problems to borrow  funds to pay  dividends.  Furthermore,  under the
prompt corrective action regulations  adopted by the FRB, the FRB may prohibit a
bank holding  company from paying any  dividends if the holding  company's  bank
subsidiary is classified as "undercapitalized."

     Bank holding companies are required to give the FRB prior written notice of
any purchase or redemption  of its  outstanding  equity  securities if the gross
consideration  for the  purchase  or  redemption,  when  combined  with  the net
consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12
months,  is equal to 10% or more of their  consolidated  net worth.  The FRB may
disapprove  such a purchase or  redemption  if it  determines  that the proposal
would  constitute  an unsafe  or  unsound  practice  or would  violate  any law,
regulation,  FRB order, or any condition  imposed by, or written agreement with,
the FRB. This notification  requirement does not apply to any company that meets
the  well-capitalized  standard for commercial banks, has a safety and soundness
examination  rating  of at  least a "2"  and is not  subject  to any  unresolved
supervisory issues.

     Holding  Company  Capital  Requirements.  The FRB has  established  capital
requirements  for bank holding  companies  that  generally  parallel the capital
requirements for commercial banks and federal thrift  institutions such as First
Federal and Security. First Midwest is in compliance with these requirements.

     Federal Home Loan Bank System.  First Federal and Security are both members
of the FHLB of Des Moines,  which is one of 12 regional FHLBs,  that administers
the home financing credit function of savings associations.  Each FHLB serves as
a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned  region.  It makes
loans to members  (i.e.,  advances) in accordance  with policies and  procedures
established by the board of directors of the FHLB. These policies and procedures
are subject to the  regulation  and  oversight  of the Federal  Housing  Finance
Board. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient
collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition,  all long-term  advances must
be used for residential home financing.

     As members of the FHLB System,  First  Federal and Security are required to
purchase and maintain  stock in the FHLB of Des Moines.  At September  30, 2002,
the  Banks  had in the  aggregate  $6.8  million  in FHLB  stock,  which  was in
compliance with this requirement.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002,
dividends  paid by the FHLB of Des Moines to First Federal and Security  totaled
$228,000.  Over the past five calendar  years such dividends have averaged 6.27%
and were 3.00% for the first three quarters of the calendar year 2002.

     Under  federal  law  the  FHLBs  are  required  to  provide  funds  for the
resolution  of  troubled  savings  associations  and to  contribute  to low- and
moderately priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on
advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income  housing
projects.  These  contributions  have  affected  adversely  the  level  of  FHLB
dividends  paid and could continue to do so in the future.  These  contributions
could also have an adverse  effect on the value of FHLB stock in the  future.  A
reduction in value of First  Federal's FHLB stock may result in a  corresponding
reduction in First Federal's capital.  Recent  legislative  changes will require
the FHLB to change  the  characteristics  and  amount of FHLB  stock held by its
members.  It is also anticipated that these changes will restrict the ability of
FHLB members to redeem their shares of FHLB stock.

Federal and State Taxation

     Federal  Taxation.  First Midwest and its  subsidiaries  file  consolidated
federal  income tax returns on a fiscal  year basis using the accrual  method of
accounting.  In  addition to the regular  income  tax,  corporations,  including
savings banks such as First Federal,  generally are subject to a minimum tax. An
alternative  minimum tax is imposed at a minimum tax rate of 20% on  alternative
minimum  taxable  income,  which is the sum of a  corporation's  regular taxable
income (with certain  adjustments) and tax preference  items, less any available
exemption.  The alternative  minimum tax is imposed to the extent it exceeds the
corporation's  regular  income tax and net  operating  losses can offset no more
than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income.

     To the extent  earnings  appropriated to a savings bank's bad debt reserves
and deducted for federal income tax purposes exceed the allowable amount of such
reserves  computed under the  experience  method and to the extent of the bank's
supplemental  reserves  for  losses on loans  ("Excess"),  such  Excess may not,
without adverse tax consequences,  be utilized for the payment of cash dividends
or other distributions to a shareholder (including  distributions on redemption,
dissolution or  liquidation) or for any other purpose (except to absorb bad debt
losses).  As of September  30,  2002,  First  Federal's  Excess for tax purposes
totaled approximately $6.7 million.

     First Midwest and its  consolidated  subsidiaries  have not been audited by
the IRS within the past ten years. In the opinion of management, any examination
of still open returns (including returns of subsidiaries and predecessors of, or
entities  merged into,  First  Midwest)  would not result in a deficiency  which
could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of First Midwest
and its subsidiaries.

     Iowa Taxation.  First Federal and Security file Iowa franchise tax returns.
First Midwest and First Federal's  subsidiary file Iowa  corporation tax returns
on a fiscal year-end basis.

     Iowa  imposes a  franchise  tax on the  taxable  income of mutual and stock
savings banks and commercial banks. The tax rate is 5%, which may effectively be
increased,  in individual  cases,  by  application  of a minimum tax  provision.
Taxable  income under the franchise tax is generally  similar to taxable  income
under the federal  corporate  income tax, except that,  under the Iowa franchise
tax, no deduction is allowed for Iowa  franchise tax payments and taxable income
includes  interest  on  state  and  municipal  obligations.   Interest  on  U.S.
obligations  is  taxable  under the Iowa  franchise  tax and  under the  federal
corporate  income tax.  The taxable  income for Iowa  franchise  tax purposes is
apportioned to Iowa through the use of a one-factor  formula consisting of gross
receipts only.

     Taxable income under the Iowa corporate income tax is generally  similar to
taxable income under the federal  corporate  income tax, except that,  under the
Iowa tax, no deduction is allowed for Iowa income tax  payments;  interest  from
state and  municipal  obligations  is  included  in income;  interest  from U.S.
obligations  is excluded from income;  and 50% of federal  corporate  income tax
payments are excluded  from income.  The Iowa  corporate  income tax rates range
from  6% to 12%  and may be  effectively  increased,  in  individual  cases,  by
application of a minimum tax provision.

     South Dakota Taxation.  First Federal and First Services Trust Company file
South Dakota  franchise  tax returns due to their  operations in Sioux Falls and
Brookings.  The South Dakota franchise tax is imposed on depository institutions
and trust companies.  First Midwest,  Security and First Federal's  subsidiaries
are therefore not subject to the South Dakota franchise tax.

     South Dakota  imposes a franchise  tax on the taxable  income of depository
institutions  and trust  companies at the rate of 6%.  Taxable  income under the
franchise tax is generally similar to taxable income under the federal corporate

                                       36
<PAGE>

income tax, except that,  under the South Dakota  franchise tax, no deduction is
allowed for state income and franchise taxes, bad debt deductions are determined
on the basis of actual  charge-offs,  income from municipal  obligations  exempt
from federal taxes are included in the franchise taxable income,  and there is a
deduction  allowed for federal  income taxes  accrued for the fiscal  year.  The
taxable  income for South Dakota  franchise tax purposes is apportioned to South
Dakota through the use of a three-factor formula consisting of tangible real and
personal property, payroll and gross receipts.

     Delaware Taxation. As a Delaware holding company, First Midwest is exempted
from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with
and pay an annual fee to the State of Delaware. First Midwest is also subject to
an annual franchise tax imposed by the State of Delaware.

Competition

     The Company faces strong  competition,  both in originating real estate and
other loans and in attracting  deposits.  Competition in originating real estate
loans comes  primarily from  commercial  banks,  savings  banks,  credit unions,
insurance  companies,  and mortgage  bankers making loans secured by real estate
located in the Company's market area. Commercial banks and credit unions provide
vigorous  competition in consumer lending.  The Company competes for real estate
and other loans  principally on the basis of the quality of services it provides
to borrowers, interest rates and loan fees it charges, and the types of loans it
originates.

     The  Company  attracts  all of its  deposits  through  its  retail  banking
offices,  primarily from the  communities in which those retail banking  offices
are located; therefore, competition for those deposits is principally from other
commercial banks,  savings banks, credit unions and brokerage offices located in
the same  communities.  The Company  competes  for these  deposits by offering a
variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, and
convenient branch locations with interbranch  deposit and withdrawal  privileges
at each.

     The Company serves Adair, Buena Vista,  Calhoun,  Guthrie, Ida, Pocahontas,
Polk and Sac counties in Iowa and Brookings,  Lincoln and Minnehaha  counties in
South Dakota.  There are thirty-six  commercial  banks,  one savings bank, other
than First Federal, and one credit union which compete for deposits and loans in
First  Federal's  primary  market area in  northwest  Iowa and eight  commercial
banks,  one savings bank,  other than First Federal,  and one credit union which
compete for  deposits  and loans in First  Federal's  market area in  Brookings,
South Dakota.  In addition,  there are thirteen  commercial  banks in Security's
primary  market area in west central Iowa.  First Federal  competes for deposits
and  loans  with  numerous   financial   institutions   located  throughout  the
metropolitan market areas of Des Moines, Iowa and Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Employees

     At September 30, 2002, the Company and its  subsidiaries had a total of 167
employees,  including 14 part-time  employees.  The Company's  employees are not
represented  by  any  collective  bargaining  group.  Management  considers  its
employee relations to be good.

Executive Officers of the Company Who Are Not Directors

     The following  information  as to the business  experience  during the past
five years is supplied with respect to the executive officers of the Company who
do not serve on the Company's  Board of Directors.  There are no arrangements or
understandings between such persons named and any persons pursuant to which such
officers were selected.

Item 2. Properties

     The Company  conducts its business at its main office and branch  office in
Storm  Lake,  Iowa,  and five other  locations  in its  primary  market  area in
Northwest Iowa. The Company also operates one office in Brookings, South Dakota,
through the Company's  Brookings Federal Bank division of the Bank; four offices
in Des Moines,  Iowa,  through the  Company's  Iowa Savings Bank division of the
Bank; one office in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, through the Company's Sioux Falls
division  of the Bank;  and three  offices  in West  Central  Iowa  through  the
Company's Security State Bank subsidiary.

     The Company owns all of its offices,  except for the branch offices located
at Storm Lake Plaza, Storm Lake, Iowa and West Des Moines,  Iowa as to which the
land is leased. The total net book value of the Company's premises and equipment
(including land, building and leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and
equipment)  at  September  30,  2002 was $11.1  million.  See Note 6 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

     The Company  believes that its current  facilities are adequate to meet the
present and foreseeable needs of the Company and the Banks.

     The Bank  maintains  an  on-line  data base with a  service  bureau,  whose
primary business is providing such services to financial  institutions.  The net
book value of the data processing and computer equipment utilized by the Company
at September 30, 2002 was approximately $810,000.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

     The Company is involved as plaintiff or defendant in various  legal actions
arising in the normal  course of its  business.  While the  ultimate  outcome of
these  proceedings  cannot be  predicted  with  certainty,  it is the opinion of
management,   after  consultation  with  counsel  representing  Company  in  the
proceedings, that the resolution of these proceedings should not have a material
effect on Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     No  matter  was  submitted  to a vote  of  security  holders,  through  the
solicitation  of proxies or otherwise,  during the quarter  ended  September 30,
2002.
