                                     PART I

Item 1.  Description of Business

General

     First  Midwest  Financial,  Inc. is a Delaware  corporation,  the principal
assets of which  are all the  issued  and  outstanding  shares of First  Federal
Savings  Bank  of  the  Midwest  ("First   Federal")  and  Security  State  Bank
("Security").  First Midwest, on September 20, 1993, acquired all of the capital
stock of First Federal in connection  with First  Federal's  conversion from the
mutual to stock form ownership (the "Conversion").  On September 30, 1996, First
Midwest  became a bank holding  company  upon its  acquisition  of Security,  as
discussed below.

     Since  the  Conversion,   the  Company  has  acquired   several   financial
institutions.  On March 28, 1994, First Midwest acquired  Brookings Federal Bank
in Brookings,  South Dakota  ("Brookings").  On December 29, 1995, First Midwest
acquired Iowa Savings Bank, FSB in Des Moines, Iowa ("Iowa Savings").  Brookings
and Iowa Savings were both merged with,  and now operate as divisions  of, First
Federal.  On September 30, 1996,  First Midwest  completed  the  acquisition  of
Central West Bancorporation ("CWB"). CWB was the holding company for Security in
Stuart,  Iowa,  which  upon the  merger of CWB into First  Midwest  resulted  in
Security becoming a stand-alone banking subsidiary of First Midwest.  Unless the
context  otherwise  requires,  references  herein to the Company  include  First
Midwest,  Security  and First  Federal and all  subsidiaries  on a  consolidated
basis.

     First Federal and Security (collectively, the "Banks") are the only direct,
active banking subsidiaries of First Midwest.  The Banks are  community-oriented
financial  institutions  offering a variety of  financial  services  to meet the
needs of the communities they serve. The Company,  through the Banks, provides a
full range of  financial  services.  The  principal  business  of First  Federal
historically has consisted of attracting retail deposits from the general public
and investing those funds primarily in one- to four-family  residential mortgage
loans  and,  to a  lesser  extent,  commercial  and  multi-family  real  estate,
agricultural  operating and real estate,  construction,  consumer and commercial
business  loans  primarily  in First  Federal's  market  area.  Recently,  First

                                        2

<PAGE>


Federal's lending  activities have expanded to include an increased  emphasis on
originations  and purchases of commercial  and  multi-family  real estate loans,
generally from outside First  Federal's  market area. The principal  business of
Security  has been and  continues  to be  attracting  retail  deposits  from the
general  public  and  investing  those  funds in  agricultural  real  estate and
operating  loans,  and commercial and  multi-family  real estate loans and, to a
lesser extent, one- to four-family residential, commercial business and consumer
loans.  The Banks also purchase  mortgage-backed  securities  and invest in U.S.
Government  and  agency  obligations  and  other  permissible  investments.   At
September 30, 2001, the Company had total assets of $523.2 million,  deposits of
$338.8 million, and shareholders' equity of $43.7 million.

     The  Company's  revenues are derived  primarily  from  interest on mortgage
loans,  mortgage-backed  securities,  investments,  consumer loans, agricultural
operating loans, commercial business loans, income from service charges and loan
originations,  loan  servicing  fee  income,  and income from the sale of mutual
funds, insurance products,  annuities and brokerage services through its service
corporation subsidiaries.

     First Federal, directly through its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Services
Financial  Limited ("First  Services"),  offers mutual funds,  equities,  bonds,
insurance products and annuities.

     First Midwest and the Banks are subject to  comprehensive  regulation.  See
"Regulation" herein.

     The  executive  offices of the Company are located at Fifth at Erie,  Storm
Lake, Iowa 50588. Its telephone number at that address is (712) 732-4117.

Market Area

     First Federal Savings Bank of the Midwest has four divisions: First Federal
Savings Bank Storm Lake,  Brookings  Federal  Bank,  Iowa Savings Bank and First
Federal Savings Bank Sioux Falls. First Federal's headquarters is located on the
corner of Fifth and Erie streets in Storm Lake,  Iowa.  First Federal Storm Lake
operates a total of seven  offices in Storm Lake,  Lake View,  Laurens,  Manson,
Odebolt and Sac City,  Iowa.  Brookings  Federal Bank operates two facilities in
Brookings,  South  Dakota.  Iowa Savings Bank operates  three  facilities in Des
Moines and West Des Moines,  Iowa.  A fourth Iowa Savings Bank office is planned
for  construction in Urbandale,  Iowa.  First Federal Sioux Falls moved from its
temporary facility to a newly constructed building in April 2001.

     Security  State Bank  operates  its  business  through  three  full-service
offices in Casey, Menlo and Stuart, Iowa.

     The  Company's  primary  market area  includes the Iowa  counties of Adair,
Buena Vista,  Calhoun,  Guthrie,  Ida,  Pocahontas,  Polk and Sac, and the South
Dakota counties of Brookings, Lincoln and Minnehaha.

     Storm Lake is located in northwest Iowa  approximately  150 miles northwest
of Des Moines and 200 miles south of  Minneapolis  in Buena Vista  County.  Like
much of the State of Iowa, Storm Lake and the surrounding market area are highly
dependent upon farming and  agricultural  markets.  Major  employers in the area
include Buena Vista Regional  Medical Center,  IBP, Inc., Bil Mar Foods of Iowa,

                                        3

and Buena Vista University,  which currently enrolls 1,292 full-time students at
its Storm Lake campus and employs 88 full-time faculty.

     Brookings is located in east central South Dakota,  approximately  50 miles
north of Sioux Falls and 200 miles west of Minneapolis in Brookings County.  The
bank's market area encompasses  approximately a 30 mile radius of Brookings. The
area is  generally  rural,  and  agriculture  is a  significant  industry in the
community.  South Dakota State  University is the largest employer in Brookings.
The University  had 8,720  students  enrolled for the 2000 fall term and employs
504 full- time faculty. The community also has several manufacturing  companies,
including 3M, Larson  Manufacturing,  Daktronics,  Falcon Plastics and Twin City
Fan. The  Brookings  division  operates  from a main office  located in downtown
Brookings and one drive-up branch office also located in Brookings.

     Des Moines,  Iowa's  capitol,  is located in central  Iowa.  The Des Moines
market area encompasses Polk County and surrounding counties.  Iowa Savings Bank
Division's main office operates near a high-traffic intersection,  across from a
major shopping mall in West Des Moines. The Ingersoll office is located near the
heart of Des Moines,  on a major thorough fare, in a densely populated area. The
Highland Park facility is located in a historical  district  approximately  five
minutes  north of  downtown  Des  Moines.  Des  Moines  is one of the top  three
insurance centers in the world, with sixty-seven  insurance company headquarters
and over one hundred regional insurance offices.  Other major businesses include
Hy-Vee  Food  Stores,  Inc.,  Bridgestone-Firestone,  Inc.,  Communication  Data
Services,   Inc.,  Pioneer  Hi-Bred,   John  Deere,  and  Meredith  Corporation.
Universities  in the area  include  Drake  University,  Upper  Iowa  University,
Simpson  College,  Grand  View  College,  Hamilton  College  and the Des  Moines
University - Osteopathic Medical Center.

     Sioux  Falls is  located  at the  crossroads  of  Interstates  29 and 90 in
southeast  South Dakota,  270 miles  southwest of  Minneapolis.  The Sioux Falls
market area  encompasses  Minnehaha  and Lincoln  counties.  The city has ranked
number  two on the list of  national  entrepreneurial  hot spots in 1999 and was
among the top ten cities for new jobs and for new or expanded facilities in 1998
(Cogenetics,  Inc. April 1999; Site Selection,  1998).  The bank is located at a
high-traffic  intersection  of  Minnesota  and 33rd in the heart of Sioux Falls.
Major  employers  in the area  include  Sioux Valley  Hospital,  Avera  McKennan
Hospital,  John Morrell & Company,  Gateway, Inc., Midwest Coast Transport,  and
Hy-Vee Food Stores.  Sioux Falls is also home to Augustana  College,  enrollment
1,807, and The University of Sioux Falls, enrollment 1,332.

     Security's main office operates in Stuart, which is located in west-central
Iowa,  approximately  40 miles  west of Des  Moines  on the  border of Adair and
Guthrie  counties.  Security's  market area is highly  dependent  on farming and
agriculture-related businesses, such as Agri-Drain Corporation,  Cardinal Glass,
and  Rose  Acre  Farms.  In  recent  years,  efforts  of the West  Central  I-80
Development   Corporation  have  resulted  in  significant  development  of  new
service-related  businesses in the area,  associated with the westward expansion
of Des Moines and direct interstate highway access. Seven industrial parks exist
in  these  two  counties.   This  development  provides  economic  diversity  to
Security's market area.

     Several of the Company's market areas are dependant on  agriculture-related
businesses.  Agriculture-related  businesses in recent years have performed well

                                        4

due to a relatively  stable  agricultural  environment  in the Company's  market
area.  The recent  decline in grain prices has  challenged  area grain  farmers,
however, livestock prices have improved over the past year to help stabilize the
agricultural  economy.  Although there has been minimal effect observed to date,
an extended period of low commodity  prices could result in a reduced demand for
goods and services provided by agriculture-related  businesses, which could also
affect other businesses in the Company's market area.

Lending Activities

     General.  Historically,  the Company  has  originated  fixed-rate,  one- to
four-family  mortgage loans. In the early 1980's,  the Company began to focus on
the origination of  adjustable-rate  mortgage ("ARM") loans and short-term loans
for retention in its  portfolio in order to increase the  percentage of loans in
its portfolio with more frequent  repricing or shorter  maturities,  and in some
cases higher yields,  than fixed-rate  residential  mortgage loans. The Company,
however,  has continued to originate  fixed-rate  residential  mortgage loans in
response  to consumer  demand.  See  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis --
Asset/Liability Management" in the Annual Report.

     While the Company  historically  has focused its lending  activities on the
origination  of loans  secured  by first  mortgages  on  owner-occupied  one- to
four-family  residences,   it  also  originates  and  purchases  commercial  and
multi-family  real estate loans and originates  consumer,  commercial  business,
residential and commercial  construction and  agriculturally  related loans. The
Company  originates most of its loans in its primary market area. More recently,
the Company  has  increased  its  emphasis,  both in  absolute  dollars and as a
percentage  of its gross  loan  portfolio,  on these  less  traditional  lending
activities.  At September 30, 2001,  the Company's  net loan  portfolio  totaled
$333.0 million, or 63.7% of the Company's total assets.

     Loan  applications are initially  considered and approved at various levels
of authority, depending on the type, amount and loan-to-value ratio of the loan.
The Company has loan  committees for each of the Banks  comprised of officers of
such Banks.  Loans in excess of certain amounts require the approval of at least
two  committee  members who must also be executive  officers,  or by such Bank's
Board of Directors,  which has responsibility for the overall supervision of the
loan portfolio. The Company reserves the right to discontinue,  adjust or create
new lending programs to respond to its needs and to competitive factors.

     At September 30, 2001,  the Company's  largest  lending  relationship  to a
single borrower or group of related borrowers totaled $8.0 million.  The Company
had  fourteen  other  lending  relationships  in  excess of $3.0  million  as of
September 30, 2001 with the average  outstanding  balance of such loans totaling
approximately  $4.5  million.  At September  30,  2001,  each of these loans was
performing in accordance  with its  repayment  terms,  except for a $3.0 million
commercial   real   estate   participation   loan   secured   by   an   assisted
living/retirement   facility   and  a  $4.5  million   commercial   real  estate
participation  loan secured by a hotel, both of which were 60 days delinquent at
fiscal year end.

     The  total  amount  of loans  due  after  September  30,  2002  which  have
predetermined  interest rates is $116.1 million, while the total amount of loans
due after such date which have floating or adjustable  interest  rates is $138.1
million.

     One- to  Four-Family  Residential  Mortgage  Lending.  One- to  four-family
residential  mortgage loan originations are generated by the Company's marketing
efforts, its present customers, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate
agents and builders.  At September 30, 2001,  the Company's  one- to four-family
residential  mortgage  loan  portfolio  totaled $95.6  million,  or 27.9% of the
Company's total gross loan portfolio.  Approximately 29.6% of the Company's one-
to  four-family  mortgage  loans or 8.2% of the Company's  gross loans have been
purchased,  generally from other financial  institutions.  The majority of these
are ARM loans. See "--Originations,  Purchases, Sales and Servicing of Loans and
Mortgage-Backed  Securities."  At September  30, 2001,  the average  outstanding
principal  balance  of a one-  to  four-family  residential  mortgage  loan  was
$59,500.

     The  Company  offers  fixed-rate  and ARM  loans.  During  the  year  ended
September 30, 2001, the Company originated $1.9 million of adjustable-rate loans
and $37.1 million of fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residential
real estate. The Company's one- to four-family residential mortgage originations
are secured  primarily  by  properties  located in its  primary  market area and
surrounding areas.

     The Company originates one- to four-family  residential mortgage loans with
terms up to a maximum of 30-years and with loan-to-value ratios up to 97% of the
lesser of the appraised  value of the security  property or the contract  price.
The Company generally requires that private mortgage insurance be obtained in an
amount  sufficient  to  reduce  the  Company's  exposure  to at or below the 80%
loan-to-value  level or the loans are sold.  Residential  loans generally do not
include prepayment penalties.

     The Company  currently  offers  one,  three and five year ARM loans with an
initial interest rate margin over the yield on the  corresponding  U.S. Treasury
Security.  These loans have a fixed-rate for the stated period and,  thereafter,
such loans adjust annually.  These loans generally  provide for an annual cap of
up to a 200 basis points and a lifetime cap of 600 basis points over the initial
rate. As a consequence  of using an initial  fixed-rate  and caps,  the interest
rates on these loans may not be as rate  sensitive as is the  Company's  cost of
funds.  The Company's ARMs do not permit negative  amortization of principal and
are not  convertible  into a fixed rate loan.  The  Company  qualifies  ARM loan
borrowers at the fully indexed rate. The Company's delinquency experience on its
ARM loans has generally been similar to its experience on fixed rate residential
loans.

     Due to consumer demand,  the Company also offers fixed-rate  mortgage loans
with terms up to 30 years,  most of which conform to secondary market standards,
i.e., Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac standards.  Interest rates charged
on  these  fixed-rate  loans  are  competitively   priced  according  to  market
conditions.  The Company  currently  sells most,  but not all, of its fixed-rate
loans with terms of 15 years or longer.

     In  underwriting  one- to four-family  residential  real estate loans,  the
Company  evaluates both the borrower's  ability to make monthly payments and the


                                        9

<PAGE>


value of the property  securing the loan. Most  properties  securing real estate
loans made by the Company are appraised by independent  fee appraisers  approved
by the Board of Directors. The Company generally requires borrowers to obtain an
attorney's  title  opinion,  and fire and property  insurance  (including  flood
insurance, if necessary) in an amount not less than the amount of the loan. Real
estate loans originated by the Company  generally contain a "due on sale" clause
allowing  the  Company to declare the unpaid  principal  balance due and payable
upon the sale of the security property.

     Commercial  and  Multi-Family  Real  Estate  Lending.  The  Company is also
engaged in commercial and multi-family real estate lending in its primary market
area and  surrounding  areas  and has  purchased  whole  loan and  participation
interests in loans from other financial institutions. At September 30, 2001, the
Company's  commercial and multi-family real estate loan portfolio totaled $123.6
million,  or 36.0% of the Company's  total gross loan  portfolio.  The purchased
loans and loan  participation  interests  are  generally  secured by  properties
located in the Midwest and  Northwest.  The Company,  in order to supplement its
loan  portfolio  and  consistent  with  management's  objectives  to expand  the
Company's  commercial and multi-family loan portfolio,  purchased $24.0 million,
$48.9 million and $42.4 million of such loans during fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  At  September  30,  2001,  $464,000  or  0.4%  of  the  Company's
commercial  and  multi-family  real estate loans were  non-performing.  See " --
Non-Performing Assets, Other Loans of Concern and Classified Assets."

     The Company's  commercial  and  multi-family  real estate loan portfolio is
secured   primarily   by   apartment   buildings,    nursing   homes,   assisted
living/retirement  facilities,  office  buildings  and  hotels.  Commercial  and
multi-family real estate loans generally have terms that do not exceed 20 years,
have  loan-to-value  ratios of up to 80% of the appraised  value of the security
property, and are typically secured by personal guarantees of the borrowers. The
Company  has a  variety  of rate  adjustment  features  and  other  terms in its
commercial  and  multi-family   real  estate  loan  portfolio.   Commercial  and
multi-family  real estate loans  provide for a margin over a number of different
indices.  In  underwriting  these  loans,  the Company  currently  analyzes  the
financial  condition of the borrower,  the borrower's  credit  history,  and the
reliability  and  predictability  of the cash  flow  generated  by the  property
securing the loan.  Appraisals on  properties  securing  commercial  real estate
loans originated by the Company are performed by independent appraisers.

     At September 30, 2001, the Company's  largest  commercial and  multi-family
real estate loan was a $6.3 million loan secured by a retail shopping  center, a
single-family residential housing development and other real estate. The Company
had fifteen other commercial and/or multi-family loans in excess of $2.5 million
at such date.  All of these loans are currently  performing  in accordance  with
their terms, except for a $3.0 million commercial real estate participation loan
secured by an assisted  living/retirement facility and a $4.5 million commercial
real estate  participation  loan secured by a hotel,  both of which were 60 days
delinquent  at fiscal year end. At September 30, 2001,  the average  outstanding
principal  balance of a commercial or multi-family  real estate loan held by the
Company was $371,000.

     Multi-family  and commercial real estate loans  generally  present a higher
level of risk than loans secured by one- to four-family residences. This greater
risk is due to several  factors,  including the  concentration of principal in a
limited number of loans and borrowers, the effect of general economic conditions
on income  producing  properties and the increased  difficulty of evaluating and


                                       10

monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore,  the repayment of loans secured by
multi-family  and  commercial  real  estate  is  typically  dependent  upon  the
successful  operation of the related real estate project.  If the cash flow from
the project is reduced (for example, if leases are not obtained or renewed, or a
bankruptcy  court  modifies a lease term, or a major tenant is unable to fulfill
its  lease  obligations),  the  borrower's  ability  to  repay  the  loan may be
impaired.

     Construction  Lending.  The Company makes construction loans to individuals
for  the  construction  of  their  residences  as well  as to  builders  for the
construction of one- to four-family  residences and commercial and  multi-family
real estate.  At September 30, 2001, the Company's  construction  loan portfolio
totaled $21.9 million, or 6.4% of the Company's total gross loan portfolio.

     Construction loans to individuals for their residences are structured to be
converted  to  permanent  loans  at the  end of the  construction  phase,  which
typically  runs up to twelve  months.  These  construction  loans have rates and
terms which generally  match the one- to four-family  loan rates then offered by
the  Company,  except  that  during the  construction  phase the  borrower  pays
interest  only.  Generally,  the maximum  loan-to-value  ratio of owner occupied
single  family  construction  loans  is  80%  of  appraised  value.  Residential
construction  loans are generally  underwritten  pursuant to the same guidelines
used for  originating  permanent  residential  loans. At September 30, 2001, the
Company had $2.5 million of construction loans to borrowers intending to live in
the properties upon completion of construction.

     Construction  loans to builders of one- to four-family  residences  require
the  payment  of  interest  only for up to 24 months  and have terms of up to 24
months.  These loans may provide for the payment of interest  and loan fees from
loan  proceeds  and carry  adjustable  rates of  interest.  Loan fees charged in
connection with the origination of such loans are generally 1%. At September 30,
2001,  the  Company did not have any  construction  loans to builders of one- to
four-family residences.

     Construction  loans on commercial and multi-family real estate projects may
be secured by  apartments,  agricultural  facilities,  small  office  buildings,
medical facilities,  assisted living facilities,  hotels or other property,  and
are structured to be converted to permanent loans at the end of the construction
phase, which generally runs up to 18 months. These construction loans have rates
and terms which match any permanent  multi-family or commercial real estate loan
then  offered by the  Company,  except  that during the  construction  phase the
borrower pays interest only.  These loans  generally  provide for the payment of
interest and loan fees from loan  proceeds.  At September 30, 2001,  the Company
had approximately  $19.4 million of loans for the construction of commercial and
multi-family  real  estate.  This amount  consisted  of one loan  totaling  $5.0
million for the construction of an assisted living  facility,  one loan totaling
$2.3 million for the construction of a hotel, one loan totaling $1.0 million for
the construction of an apartment  complex,  and ten loans totaling $11.1 million
for  the  construction  of  commercial  facilities.  All  of  these  loans  were
performing in accordance with their terms at September 30, 2001.

     Construction loans are obtained principally through continued business from
builders who have  previously  borrowed  from the Company,  as well as referrals
from existing customers and walk-in customers.  The application process includes
a  submission  to the Company of accurate  plans,  specifications,  costs of the
project to be constructed and projected  revenues from the project.  These items


                                       11


<PAGE>


are also  used as a basis  to  determine  the  appraised  value  of the  subject
property.  Loans are based on the lesser of the current  appraised  value of the
property or the cost of construction (land plus building).

     Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating  construction costs and
the market for the  project  upon  completion,  it is  relatively  difficult  to
evaluate  accurately  the total loan funds  required to complete a project,  the
related  loan-to-value  ratios and the  likelihood  of  ultimate  success of the
project. Construction loans to borrowers other than owner-occupants also involve
many of the same risks  discussed above  regarding  multi-family  and commercial
real estate loans and tend to be more sensitive to general  economic  conditions
than many other  types of loans.  Also,  the  funding of loan fees and  interest
during the  construction  phase  makes the  monitoring  of the  progress  of the
project  particularly  important,  as customary early warning signals of project
difficulties may not be present.

     Agricultural  Lending. The Company originates loans to finance the purchase
of farmland,  livestock, farm machinery and equipment,  seed, fertilizer and for
other farm related products. At September 30, 2001, the Company had agricultural
real estate loans  secured by farmland of $11.7 million or 3.4% of the Company's
gross loan portfolio.  At the same date, $25.3 million, or 7.4% of the Company's
gross loan  portfolio,  consisted  of  secured  loans  related  to  agricultural
operations.

     Agricultural  operating  loans are  originated  at either an  adjustable or
fixed rate of interest  for up to a one year term or, in the case of  livestock,
upon sale.  Most  agricultural  operating  loans have terms of one year or less.
Such loans provide for payments of principal and interest at least annually,  or
a lump sum payment  upon  maturity if the  original  term is less than one year.
Loans secured by agricultural  machinery are generally  originated as fixed-rate
loans with terms of up to seven  years.  At  September  30,  2001,  the  average
outstanding  principal  balance of an  agricultural  operating  loan held by the
Company was $45,000. At September 30, 2001, $569,000,  or 2.3%, of the Company's
agricultural operating loans were non-performing.

     Agricultural  real estate loans are frequently  originated  with adjustable
rates of interest.  Generally,  such loans  provide for a fixed rate of interest
for the first one to five years,  adjusting  annually  thereafter.  In addition,
such loans generally amortize over a period of ten to 20 years.  Adjustable-rate
agricultural  real  estate  loans  provide  for a margin  over the yields on the
corresponding U.S. Treasury Security or prime rate. Fixed-rate agricultural real
estate loans  generally  have terms up to five years.  Agricultural  real estate
loans are  generally  limited to 75% of the value of the  property  securing the
loan. At September  30, 2001,  none of the  Company's  agricultural  real estate
portfolio was non-performing.

     Agricultural  lending  affords the Company the  opportunity  to earn yields
higher  than  those  obtainable  on one-  to  four-family  residential  lending.
Nevertheless,  agricultural  lending involves a greater degree of risk than one-
to four-family  residential  mortgage loans because of the typically larger loan
amount. In addition, payments on loans are dependent on the successful operation
or management  of the farm property  securing the loan or for which an operating
loan is  utilized.  The success of the loan may also be affected by many factors
outside the control of the farm borrower.

     Weather  presents one of the greatest risks as hail,  drought,  floods,  or
other conditions, can severely limit crop yields and thus impair loan repayments
and the value of the  underlying  collateral.  This risk can be  reduced  by the
farmer  with a variety  of  insurance  coverages  which can help to ensure  loan


                                       12

<PAGE>


repayment.  Government  support  programs,  and recently the Company,  generally
require that farmers procure crop insurance coverage.

     Grain and livestock  prices also present a risk as prices may decline prior
to sale  resulting in a failure to cover  production  costs.  These risks may be
reduced by the farmer with the use of futures  contracts  or options to mitigate
price risk. The Company frequently requires borrowers to use future contracts or
options to reduce price risk and help ensure loan repayment.

     Another  risk  is  the   uncertainty  of  government   programs  and  other
regulations.  During periods of low commodity prices, the income from government
programs can be a significant  source of cash to make loan payments and if these
programs  are  discontinued  or  significantly  changed,  cash flow  problems or
defaults could result.

     Finally,  many farms are dependent on a limited  number of key  individuals
upon whose injury or death may result in an inability  to  successfully  operate
the farm.

     Consumer  Lending.  The Company offers a variety of secured consumer loans,
including automobile, boat, home equity, home improvement,  federally guaranteed
student loans, and loans secured by savings deposits.  In addition,  the Company
offers  other  secured and  unsecured  consumer  loans.  The  Company  currently
originates  substantially  all of its consumer  loans in its primary market area
and surrounding  areas. The Company  originates  consumer loans on both a direct
and indirect basis. At September 30, 2001, the Company's consumer loan portfolio
totaled  $28.2  million,  or 8.2% of its  total  gross  loan  portfolio.  Of the
consumer loan portfolio at September 30, 2001, substantially all were short- and
intermediate-term, fixed-rate loans.

     The largest component of the Company's  consumer loan portfolio consists of
home equity loans and lines of credit.  Substantially  all of the Company's home
equity  loans and lines of credit are secured by second  mortgages  on principal
residences.  The Company will lend amounts which, together with all prior liens,
may be up to 100% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. Home
equity loans and lines of credit have  maximum  terms of up to 15 years and five
years, respectively.

     The Company  primarily  originates  automobile loans on a direct basis, but
also originates  indirect automobile loans on a very limited basis. Direct loans
are loans made when the Company  extends  credit  directly to the  borrower,  as
opposed  to  indirect  loans,  which are made when the  Company  purchases  loan
contracts,  often at a discount,  from  automobile  dealers  which have extended
credit  to  their  customers.  The  Company's  automobile  loans  typically  are
originated at fixed  interest  rates with terms up to 60 months for new and used
vehicles. Loans secured by automobiles are generally originated for up to 80% of
the N.A.D.A. book value of the automobile securing the loan.

     Consumer  loan terms vary  according  to the type and value of  collateral,
length of  contract  and  creditworthiness  of the  borrower.  The  underwriting
standards  employed by the Company for consumer loans include an application,  a
determination  of  the  applicant's  payment  history  on  other  debts  and  an
assessment of ability to meet existing  obligations and payments on the proposed


                                       13


<PAGE>

loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the
underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if
any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.

     Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential  mortgage
loans,  particularly  in the case of consumer  loans which are  unsecured or are
secured by rapidly  depreciable  assets,  such as  automobiles  or  recreational
equipment.  In such cases, any repossessed  collateral for a defaulted  consumer
loan may not provide an adequate  source of  repayment of the  outstanding  loan
balance as a result of the greater  likelihood of damage,  loss or depreciation.
In  addition,   consumer  loan  collections  are  dependent  on  the  borrower's
continuing  financial  stability,  and thus are more  likely to be  affected  by
adverse personal circumstances.  Furthermore, the application of various federal
and state laws,  including  bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount
which can be recovered on such loans. At September 30, 2001,  $33,000 or 0.1% of
the Company's consumer loan portfolio was non-performing.

     Commercial  Business  Lending.  The  Company  also  originates   commercial
business  loans.  Most of the  Company's  commercial  business  loans  have been
extended to finance local and regional  businesses and include  short-term loans
to finance machinery and equipment purchases, inventory and accounts receivable.
Commercial   loans  also  involve  the  extension  of  revolving  credit  for  a
combination  of  equipment   acquisitions   and  working  capital  in  expanding
companies. At September 30, 2001, $36.8 million, or 10.7% of the Company's total
gross loan portfolio was comprised of commercial business loans.

     The maximum term for loans  extended on machinery and equipment is based on
the  projected  useful life of such  machinery  and  equipment.  Generally,  the
maximum term on non-  mortgage  lines of credit is one year.  The  loan-to-value
ratio on such  loans and lines of credit  generally  may not  exceed  80% of the
value of the  collateral  securing the loan. The Company's  commercial  business
lending policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower's
character,  capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the  borrower's  capital
and  collateral as well as an  evaluation of conditions  affecting the borrower.
Analysis  of the  borrower's  past,  present  and  future  cash flows is also an
important  aspect of the Company's  current credit analysis.  Nonetheless,  such
loans  are  believed  to  carry  higher   credit  risk  than  more   traditional
investments.

     The largest commercial  business loan outstanding at September 30, 2001 was
a $6.3 million  warehouse line of credit secured by the assignment of automobile
contracts.  The next largest  commercial  business loan outstanding at September
30,  2001 was a $3.1  million  loan  secured  by  operating  assets  used in the
manufacture  and sale of  agricultural  equipment.  The  Company  had four other
commercial business loans outstanding in excess of $1.0 million at September 30,
2001.  All of these loans are  currently  performing  in  accordance  with their
terms.  At September 30, 2001, the average  outstanding  principal  balance of a
commercial business loan held by the Company was $88,000.

     Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of
the  borrower's  ability to make  repayment from his or her employment and other
income  and which are  secured by real  property  whose  value  tends to be more
easily ascertainable,  commercial business loans typically are made on the basis
of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's
business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial
business  loans may be  substantially  dependent  on the success of the business


                                       14


<PAGE>


itself  (which,  in turn,  is likely to be dependent  upon the general  economic
environment).  The  Company's  commercial  business  loans are usually,  but not
always,  secured  by  business  assets and  personal  guarantees.  However,  the
collateral  securing  the loans may  depreciate  over time,  may be difficult to
appraise  and may  fluctuate in value based on the success of the  business.  At
September 30, 2001,  $369,000 or 1.0% of the Company's  commercial business loan
portfolio was non-performing.


Originations,  Purchases,  Sales  and  Servicing  of Loans  and  Mortgage-Backed
Securities

     Loans are  generally  originated  by the  Company's  staff of salaried loan
officers. Loan applications are taken and processed in the branches and the main
office of the Company.  While the Company  originates both  adjustable-rate  and
fixed-rate  loans, its ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative
customer demand for loans in its market. Demand is affected by the interest rate
environment.

     The Company,  from time to time, sells whole loans and loan  participations
generally  without  recourse.  At  September  30,  2001,  there  were  no  loans
outstanding  sold  with  recourse.  When  loans are sold the  Company  typically
retains the  responsibility  for collecting and remitting loan payments,  making
certain  that real  estate tax  payments  are made on behalf of  borrowers,  and
otherwise  servicing  the loans.  The servicing fee is recognized as income over
the life of the loans.  The Company  services  loans that it originated and sold
totaling  $32.5  million at September 30, 2001, of which $12.0 million were sold
to Fannie Mae and $20.5 million were sold to others.

     In periods of economic  uncertainty,  the  Company's  ability to  originate
large dollar volumes of loans may be substantially reduced or restricted, with a
resultant  decrease  in  related  loan  origination  fees,  other fee income and
operating  earnings.  In  addition,  the  Company's  ability  to sell  loans may
substantially  decrease as potential buyers  (principally  government  agencies)
reduce their purchasing activities.

     At September  30, 2001,  approximately  $126.7  million,  or 36.9%,  of the
Company's  gross loan  portfolio  consisted  of  purchased  loans.  The  Company
believes that  purchasing  loans secured by real estate  located  outside of its
market area assists the Company in diversifying its portfolio and may lessen the
adverse  affects on the Company's  business or operations  which could result in
the event of a downturn or weakening  of the local  economy in which the Company
conducts  its  operations.   However,   additional  risks  are  associated  with
purchasing  loans secured by real estate  outside of the Company's  market area,
including the lack of knowledge of the local real estate  market and  difficulty
in monitoring and inspecting the property securing the loans.

     The following table provides information regarding the Company's balance of

Non-Performing Assets, Other Loans of Concern, and Classified Assets

     When a borrower  fails to make a required  payment on real  estate  secured
loans and  consumer  loans  within 16 days after the payment is due, the Company
generally institutes  collection procedures by mailing a delinquency notice. The
customer is contacted again, by written notice or telephone,  before the payment
is 45  days  past  due and  again  before  75  days  past  due.  In most  cases,
delinquencies  are cured  promptly;  however,  if a loan has been delinquent for


                                       17


<PAGE>


more than 90 days,  satisfactory  payment arrangements must be adhered to or the
Company will initiate foreclosure or repossession.

     Generally,  when a loan  becomes  delinquent  90 days  or more or when  the
collection of principal or interest becomes doubtful, the Company will place the
loan on a  non-accrual  status and,  as a result,  previously  accrued  interest
income on the loan is taken out of  current  income.  The loan will  remain on a
non-accrual status until the loan becomes current.

     The following  table sets forth the Company's loan  delinquencies  by type,
before  allowance  for loan  losses,  by  amount  and by  percentage  of type at
September 30, 2001.

     Delinquencies 90 days and over constituted .47% of total loans and 0.31% of
total assets.

     The table  below sets forth the amounts and  categories  of  non-performing
assets  in the  Company's  loan  portfolio.  Loans,  with some  exceptions,  are
typically  placed on  non-accrual  status when the loan  becomes 90 days or more
delinquent or when the collection of principal  and/or interest become doubtful.
For all years  presented,  the  Company's  troubled debt  restructurings  (which
involved  forgiving a portion of interest  or  principal  on any loans or making
loans at a rate  materially  less than that of market rates) are included in the
table and were performing as agreed.

     For the year ended  September 30, 2001,  gross interest  income which would
have been recorded had the  non-accruing  loans been current in accordance  with
their  original  terms  amounted to  approximately  $192,000,  of which none was
included in interest income.

     Non-accruing  Loans. At September 30, 2001, the Company had $1.6 million in
non-accruing  loans,  which  constituted  0.47%  of  the  Company's  gross  loan
portfolio.  At  such  date,  there  were  no  non-accruing  loans  or  aggregate
non-accruing loans to one borrower in excess of $500,000 in net book value.

     Other Loans of Concern.  At September 30, 2001,  there were loans  totaling
$10.2 million not included in the table above where known  information about the
possible  credit problems of borrowers  caused  management to have concern as to
the ability of the  borrower to comply with the present  loan  repayment  terms.
This amount  consisted of four one- to  four-family  residential  mortgage loans
totaling  $130,000,  four commercial  business loans totaling  $344,000 million,
nine  agricultural  operating loans totaling $1.6 million,  thirty-one  consumer

loans  totaling  $281,000 and five  commercial  real estate loans  totaling $7.8
million.

     Classified Assets.  Federal  regulations  provide for the classification of
loans and other  assets  such as debt and equity  securities  considered  by the
Office  of  Thrift   Supervision   (the  "OTS")  to  be  of  lesser  quality  as
"substandard,"  "doubtful" or "loss." An asset is considered "substandard" if it
is  inadequately  protected by the current net worth and paying  capacity of the
obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. "Substandard" assets include those
characterized by the "distinct  possibility"  that the savings  association will
sustain "some loss" if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as
"doubtful"   have  all  of  the   weaknesses   inherent   in  those   classified
"substandard,"  with the added  characteristic  that the weaknesses present make
"collection or liquidation in full," on the basis of currently  existing  facts,
conditions,  and values, "highly questionable and improbable." Assets classified
as "loss" are those  considered  "uncollectible"  and of such minimal value that
their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve
is  not   warranted.   The  loans  held  by  Security  are  subject  to  similar
classification by its regulatory authorities.

     When assets are classified as either substandard or doubtful,  the Bank may
establish  general  allowances  for loan losses in an amount  deemed  prudent by
management.  General  allowances  represent  loss  allowances  which  have  been
established to recognize the inherent risk associated  with lending  activities,
but which,  unlike  specific  allowances,  have not been allocated to particular
problem  assets.  When  assets are  classified  as "loss,"  the Bank is required
either to  establish  a  specific  allowance  for  losses  equal to 100% of that
portion of the asset so  classified  or to  charge-off  such amount.  The Banks'
determinations as to the  classification of their assets and the amount of their
valuation allowances are subject to review by their regulatory authorities,  who
may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.

     On the basis of management's  review of its assets,  at September 30, 2001,
the Company had classified a total of $7.2 million of its assets as substandard,
$49,000 as doubtful and none as loss.

     Allowance for Loan Losses.  The  allowance  for loan losses is  established
through a provision for loan losses based on management's evaluation of the risk
inherent in its loan  portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan
activity,  including  those  loans  which are being  specifically  monitored  by
management.  Such  evaluation,  which  includes a review of loans for which full
collectibility may not be reasonably assured, considers among other matters, the
estimated  fair  value  of  the  underlying  collateral,   economic  conditions,
historical  loan loss  experience and other factors that warrant  recognition in
providing for an adequate loan loss allowance.

     Current  economic  conditions in the  agricultural  sector of the Company's
market area  indicate  potential  weakness  due to  historically  low  commodity
prices.  Price  levels  for grain  crops have  generally  been  depressed  since
mid-1998 and currently remain at historically low levels.  Grain crop prices are
not expected to increase  significantly in the near term.  Livestock prices have
improved  in recent  months and are  currently  at levels that  present  minimal
concern.  The agricultural economy is accustomed to commodity price fluctuations
and is generally able to handle such fluctuations  without significant  problem.
Although the Company  underwrites  its  agricultural  loans based on the current
level of commodity prices, an extended period of low commodity prices or adverse
growing  conditions could result in weakness in the agricultural  loan portfolio

and could  create a need for the  Company to  increase  its  allowance  for loan
losses through increased charges to provision for loan losses.

     Real estate  properties  acquired  through  foreclosure are recorded at the
lower of cost or fair value.  If fair value at the date of  foreclosure is lower
than the balance of the related loan, the difference  will be charged-off to the
allowance for loan losses at the time of transfer.  Valuations are  periodically
updated by management and if the value declines, a specific provision for losses
on such property is established by a charge to operations.

     Although management believes that it uses the best information available to
determine  the  allowances,   unforeseen   market  conditions  could  result  in
adjustments and net earnings could be  significantly  affected if  circumstances
differ   substantially   from  the   assumptions   used  in  making   the  final
determination.  Future additions to the Company's  allowances will be the result
of periodic loan,  property and collateral  reviews and thus cannot be predicted
in advance.

     The following  table sets forth an analysis of the Company's  allowance for
loan losses.

         Mortgage-Backed Securities. The Company's mortgage-backed and related
securities portfolio consists of securities issued under government-sponsored
agency programs, including those of Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The
Company also holds Collateralized Mortgage Obligations ("CMOs"), as well as a
limited amount of privately issued mortgage pass-through certificates. The
Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac certificates are modified pass-through
mortgage-backed securities that represent undivided interests in underlying
pools of fixed-rate, or certain types of adjustable-rate, predominantly
single-family and, to a lesser extent, multi-family residential mortgages issued
by these government-sponsored entities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac generally
provide the certificate holder a guarantee of timely payments of interest,
whether or not collected. Ginnie Mae's guarantee to the holder is timely
payments of principal and interest, backed by the full faith and credit of the
U.S. Government. Privately issued mortgage pass-through certificates generally
provide no guarantee as to timely payment of interest or principal, and reliance
is placed on the creditworthiness of the issuer, which the Company monitors on a
regular basis.

         CMOs are special types of pass-through debt in which the stream of
principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages or mortgage-backed
securities is used to create classes with different maturities and, in some
cases, amortization schedules, as well as a residual interest, with each such
class possessing different risk characteristics. At September 30, 2001, the
Company held CMOs totaling $68.8 million, all of which were secured by
underlying collateral issued under government-sponsored agency programs or
residential real estate mortgage loans. Premiums associated with the purchase of
these CMOs are not significant, therefore, the risk of significant yield
adjustments because of accelerated prepayments is limited. Yield adjustments are
encountered as interest rates rise or decline, which in turn slows or increases
prepayment rates and affect the average lives of the CMOs.

         At September 30, 2001, $112.5 million or 98.9% of the Company's
mortgage-backed securities portfolio had fixed rates of interest and $1.3
million or 1.1% of such portfolio had adjustable rates of interest.

         Mortgage-backed securities generally increase the quality of the
Company's assets by virtue of the insurance or guarantees that back them, are
more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize
borrowings or other obligations of the Company. At September 30, 2001, $108.8
million or 95.6% of the Company's mortgage-backed securities were pledged to
secure various obligations of the Company.

         While mortgage-backed securities carry a reduced credit risk as
compared to whole loans, such securities remain subject to the risk that a
fluctuating interest rate environment, along with other factors such as the
geographic distribution of the underlying mortgage loans, may alter the
prepayment rate of such mortgage loans and so affect both the prepayment speed,
and value, of such securities. The prepayment risk associated with
mortgage-backed securities is monitored periodically, and prepayment rate
assumptions adjusted as appropriate to update the Company's mortgage-backed
securities accounting and asset/liability reports. Classification of the
Company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio as available for sale is designed
to minimize that risk.

         The following table sets forth the carrying value of the Company's
mortgage-backed securities at the dates indicated.

(1)  This security is rated Aaa by a nationally recognized rating agency.


         At September 30, 2001, the contractual maturity of 81.8% of all of the
Company's mortgage- backed securities was in excess of ten years. The actual
maturity of a mortgage-backed security is typically less than its stated
maturity due to scheduled principal payments and prepayments of the underlying
mortgages. Prepayments that are different than anticipated will affect the yield
to maturity. The yield is based upon the interest income and the amortization of
any premium or discount related to the mortgage-backed security. In accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, premiums and discounts are
amortized over the estimated lives of the loans, which decrease and increase
interest income, respectively. The prepayment assumptions used to determine the
amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the
yield of the mortgage-backed security, and these assumptions are reviewed
periodically to reflect actual prepayments. Although prepayments of underlying
mortgages depend on many factors, including the type of mortgages, the coupon
rate, the age of mortgages, the geographical location of the underlying real
estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest
rates, the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and
the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant
determinant of the rate of prepayments. During periods of falling mortgage
interest rates, if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the
prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans, refinancing
generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages
and the related security. Under such circumstances, the Company may be subject
to reinvestment risk because to the extent that the Company's mortgage-backed
securities amortize or prepay faster than anticipated, the Company may not be
able to reinvest the proceeds of such repayments and prepayments at a comparable
rate.

Sources of Funds

         General. The Company's sources of funds are deposits, borrowings,
amortization and repayment of loan principal, interest earned on or maturation
of investment securities and short-term investments, and funds provided from
operations.

         Borrowings, including Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Des Moines and
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago ("FRB") advances, reverse repurchase agreements
and retail repurchase agreements, may be used at times to compensate for
seasonal reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected
levels, may be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending
activities, and may also be used to match the funding of a corresponding asset.

         Deposits. The Company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a
wide range of interest rates and terms. The Company's deposits consist of
passbook savings accounts, money market savings accounts, NOW and regular
checking accounts, and certificate accounts currently ranging in terms from
fourteen days to 60 months. The Company only solicits deposits from its primary
market area and does not use brokers to obtain deposits. The Company relies
primarily on competitive pricing policies, advertising and customer service to
attract and retain these deposits.

         The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic
conditions, changes in money market and prevailing interest rates, and
competition.

         The variety of deposit accounts offered by the Company has allowed it
to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes
in consumer demand. The Company has become more susceptible to short-term
fluctuations in deposit flows, as customers have become more interest rate
conscious. The Company endeavors to manage the pricing of its deposits in
keeping with its asset/liability management and profitability objectives. Based
on its experience, the Company believes that its passbook savings, money market
savings accounts, NOW and regular checking accounts are relatively stable
sources of deposits. However, the ability of the Company to attract and maintain
certificates of deposit and the rates paid on these deposits has been and will
continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.

(1) Includes deposits from governmental and other public entities totaling $2.8
million.



         Borrowings. Although deposits are the Company's primary source of
funds, the Company's policy has been to utilize borrowings when they are a less
costly source of funds, can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, or
when the Company desires additional capacity to fund loan demand.


                                       30

<PAGE>



         The Company's borrowings historically have consisted of advances from
the FHLB of Des Moines upon the security of a blanket collateral agreement of a
percentage of unencumbered loans and the pledge of specific investment
securities. Such advances can be made pursuant to several different credit
programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. At
September 30, 2001, the Company had $126.4 million of advances from the FHLB of
Des Moines and the ability to borrow up to an approximate additional $50.0
million. At September 30, 2001, advances totaling $21.7 million had terms to
maturity of one year or less. The remaining $104.7 million had maturities
ranging up to 18 years.

         On July 6, 2001, the Company issued all of the 10,000 authorized shares
of Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of First
Midwest Financial Capital Trust I (preferred securities of subsidiary trust)
holding solely subordinated debt securities. Distributions are paid
semi-annually. Cumulative cash distributions are calculated at a variable rate
of LIBOR (as defined) plus 3.75%, not to exceed 12.5%. The Company may, at one
or more times, defer interest payments on the capital securities for up to 10
consecutive semi-annual periods, but not beyond July 25, 2031. At the end of any
deferral period, all accumulated and unpaid distributions will be paid. The
capital securities will be redeemed on July 25, 2031; however, the Company has
the option to shorten the maturity date to a date not earlier than July 25,
2006. The redemption price is $1,000 per capital security plus any accrued and
unpaid distributions to the date of redemption plus, if redeemed prior to July
25, 2011, a redemption premium as defined in the Indenture Agreement. Holders of
the capital securities have no voting rights, are unsecured and rank junior in
priority of payment to all of the Company's indebtedness and senior to the
Company's common stock.

         From time to time, the Company has offered retail repurchase agreements
to its customers. These agreements typically range from 14 days to five years in
term, and typically have been offered in minimum amounts of $100,000. The
proceeds of these transactions are used to meet cash flow needs of the Company.
At September 30, 2001, the Company had approximately $2.0 million of retail
repurchase agreements outstanding.

         Historically, the Company has entered into reverse repurchase
agreements through nationally recognized broker-dealer firms. These agreements
are accounted for as borrowings by the Company and are secured by certain of the
Company's investment and mortgage-backed securities. The broker-dealer takes
possession of the securities during the period that the reverse repurchase
agreement is outstanding. The terms of the agreements have typically ranged from
30 days to a maximum of six months.

         The following table sets forth the maximum month-end balance and
average balance of FHLB advances, retail and reverse repurchase agreements,
Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trust and other borrowings (consisting of FRB
advances) for the periods indicated.

Subsidiary Activities

         The only  subsidiaries  of the Company are First Federal,  Security and
First  Midwest  Financial  Capital  Trust  I.  First  Federal  has  one  service
subsidiary,  First Services Financial Limited ("First  Services").  At September
30, 2001, the net book value of First Federal's investment in First Services was
approximately  $49,000.  Security does not have any subsidiaries.  First Federal
organized First Services, its sole service corporation,  in 1983. First Services
is located in Storm Lake, Iowa and


                                       32

<PAGE>



offers mutual funds, equities, bonds, insurance products and annuities. First
Services recognized net income of $103,000 during fiscal 2001.

Regulation

         General. First Midwest currently has three wholly-owned subsidiaries,
First Federal, a federally-chartered thrift institution, Security, an
Iowa-chartered commercial bank and First Midwest Financial Capital Trust I, a
statutory business trust organized under the Delaware Business Trust Act. First
Federal is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the
OTS, as its chartering authority and primary federal regulator, and by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), which insures its deposits
up to applicable limits. First Federal is a member of the FHLB System and is
subject to certain limited regulation by the FRB. Such regulation and
supervision governs the activities in which an institution can engage and the
manner in which such activities are conducted, and is intended primarily for the
protection of the insurance fund and depositors. Security is subject to
extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Iowa Superintendent of
Banking (the "ISB") and the FRB, which are its state and primary federal
regulators, respectively. It is also subject to regulation by the FDIC, which
insures its deposits up to applicable limits. As with First Federal, such
regulation and supervision governs the activities in which Security can engage
and the manner in which such activities are conducted and is intended primarily
for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.

         First Midwest is regulated as a bank holding company by the FRB. Bank
holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by the
FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA") and the
regulations of the FRB. As a bank holding company, First Midwest must file
reports with the FRB and such additional information as the FRB may require, and
is subject to regular inspections by the FRB. First Midwest is subject to the
activity limitations imposed under the BHCA and in general may engage in only
those activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking.

         Regulatory authorities have been granted extensive discretion in
connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities which are intended
to strengthen the financial condition of the banking industry, including the
imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the
classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution's
allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether
by the OTS, the FDIC, the FRB or the Congress could have a material impact on
First Midwest, First Federal or Security and their respective operations.

         Certain of these regulatory requirements and restrictions are discussed
below or elsewhere in this document.

         Federal Regulation of Financial Institutions. The OTS has extensive
authority over the operations of savings associations. As part of this
authority, First Federal is required to file periodic reports with the OTS and
is subject to periodic examination by the OTS and the FDIC. The last regular OTS
examination of First Federal was as of November 6, 2000. When these examinations
are conducted by the OTS, the examiners may require First Federal to provide for
higher general or

                                       33

<PAGE>



specific loan loss reserves. Security is subject to similar regulation and
oversight by the ISB and the FRB and was last examined as of December 26, 2000.

         Each federal banking regulator has extensive enforcement authority over
its regulated institutions. This enforcement authority includes, among other
things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist
or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions. In general, these
enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and
unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis
for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports. Except under
certain circumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the
regulator is required.

         In addition, the investment, lending and branching authority of First
Federal is prescribed by federal laws and it is prohibited from engaging in any
activities not permitted by such laws. Security is subject to such restrictions
under state law as administered by the ISB. Federal savings associations are
also generally authorized to branch nationwide whereas Iowa chartered banks,
such as Security, are limited to establishing branches in the counties
contiguous to the county where their home office is located. At September 30,
2001, First Federal and Security were in compliance with the noted restrictions.

         First Federal's general permissible lending limit for
loans-to-one-borrower is equal to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of unimpaired
capital and surplus (except for loans fully secured by certain readily
marketable collateral, in which case this limit is increased to 25% of
unimpaired capital and surplus). Security is subject to similar restrictions. At
September 30, 2001, First Federal's and Security's lending limit under these
restrictions was $6.7 million and $953,000, respectively. First Federal and
Security are in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitation.

         Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. First Federal is a
member of the Savings Association Insurance Fund (the "SAIF") and Security is a
member of the Bank Insurance Fund (the "BIF"), each of which is administered by
the FDIC. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and such
insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
Government. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is
authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured
institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in
any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk
to the SAIF or the BIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement
actions against any FDIC insured institution after giving its primary federal
regulator the opportunity to take such action, and may terminate the deposit
insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound
practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.

         The FDIC's deposit insurance premiums are assessed through a risk-based
system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of
nine categories and assessed insurance premiums based upon their level of
capital and supervisory evaluation. The current assessment rates range from zero
to .27% per $100 of assessable deposits. Risk classification of all insured
institutions will be made by the FDIC for each semi-annual assessment period.
Institutions that are well-capitalized and have a high supervisory rating are
subject to the lowest assessment rate. At September 30, 2001, each of First
Federal and Security met the capital requirements of a "well

                                       34

<PAGE>



capitalized" institution and were not subject to any assessment.  See Note 13 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

         Regulatory Capital Requirements. Federally insured financial
institutions, such as First Federal and Security, are required to maintain a
minimum level of regulatory capital. These capital requirements mandate that an
institution maintain at least the following ratios: (1) a core (or Tier 1)
capital to adjusted total assets ratio of 4% (which can be reduced to 3% for
highly rated institutions); (2) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio
of 4% and (3) a risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8%. Capital
requirements in excess of these standards may be imposed on individual
institutions on a case-by-case basis. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

         An FDIC-insured institution's primary federal regulator is also
authorized and, under certain circumstances required, to take certain actions
against an "undercapitalized institution" (generally defined to be one with less
than either a 4% core capital ratio, a 4% Tier 1 risked-based capital ratio or
an 8% risk-based capital ratio). Any such institution must submit a capital
restoration plan and until such plan is approved by the OTS may not increase its
assets, acquire another institution, establish a branch or engage in any new
activities, and generally may not make capital distributions. The primary
federal regulator is also authorized, and with respect to institution's whose
capital is further depleted, required to impose additional restrictions that can
affect all aspects of the institution's operations, including the appointment of
a receiver for a "critically undercapitalized" institution (i.e., one with a
tangible capital ratio of 2% or less). As a condition to the approval of the
capital restoration plan, any company controlling an undercapitalized
institution must agree that it will enter into a limited capital maintenance
guarantee with respect to the institution's achievement of its capital
requirements.

         Though not anticipated, the imposition of any of these measures on
First Federal or Security may have a substantial adverse effect on Company's
operations and profitability. First Midwest shareholders do not have preemptive
rights, and therefore, if First Midwest is directed by the OTS, the FRB or the
FDIC to issue additional shares of Common Stock, such issuance may result in the
dilution in shareholders percentage of ownership of First Midwest.

         Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions. The OTS
imposes various restrictions on savings associations with respect to their
ability to make distributions of capital, which include dividends, stock
redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to
the capital account. The OTS also prohibits a savings association from declaring
or paying any dividends or from repurchasing any of its stock if, as a result of
such action, the regulatory capital of the association would be reduced below
the amount required to be maintained for the liquidation account established in
connection with the association's mutual to stock conversion.

         Savings institutions such as First Federal may make a capital
distribution without the approval of the OTS, provided they notify the OTS
30-days before they declare the capital distribution and they meet the following
requirements: (i) have a regulatory rating in one of the two top examination
categories, (ii) are not of supervisory concern, and will remain adequately- or
well- capitalized, as defined in the OTS prompt corrective action regulations,
following the proposed

                                       35

<PAGE>



distribution, and (iii) the distribution does not exceed their net income for
the calendar year-to-date plus retained net income for the previous two calendar
years (less any dividends previously paid). If a savings institution does not
meet the above stated requirements, it must obtain the prior approval of the OTS
before declaring any proposed distributions.

         Security may pay dividends, in cash or property, only out of its
undivided profits. In addition, FRB regulations prohibit the payment of
dividends by a state member bank if losses have at any time been sustained by
such bank that equal or exceed its undivided profits then on hand, unless (i)
the prior approval of the FRB has been obtained and (ii) at least two-thirds of
the shares of each class of stock outstanding have approved the dividend
payment. FRB regulations also prohibit the payment of any dividend by a state
member bank without the prior approval of the FRB if the total of all dividends
declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits
for that year combined with its retained net profits of the previous two
calendar years (minus any required transfers to a surplus or to a fund for the
retirement of any preferred stock).

         Qualified Thrift Lender Test. All savings associations, including First
Federal, are required to meet a qualified thrift lender ("QTL") test to avoid
certain restrictions on their operations. This test requires a savings
association to have at least 65% of its portfolio assets (as defined by
regulation) in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of
every 12 months on a rolling basis or meet the requirements for a domestic
building and loan association under the Internal Revenue Code. Under either
test, the required assets primarily consist of residential housing related loans
and investments. At September 30, 2001, First Federal met the test and has
always met the test since its effectiveness.

         Any savings association that fails to meet the QTL test must convert to
a national bank charter, unless it requalifies as a QTL within one year and
thereafter remains a QTL, or limits its new investments and activities to those
permissible for both a savings association and a national bank. In addition, the
association is subject to national bank limits for payment of dividends and
branching authority. If such association has not requalified or converted to a
national bank within three years after the failure, it must divest of all
investments and cease all activities not permissible for a national bank.

         Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act
("CRA"), every FDIC insured institution has a continuing and affirmative
obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the
credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income
neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or
programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's
discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are
best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA
requires the OTS and the FRB, in connection with the examination of First
Federal and Security, respectively, to assess the institution's record of
meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account
in its evaluation of certain applications, such as a merger or the establishment
of a branch, by the institution. An unsatisfactory rating may be used as the
basis for the denial of such an application. First Federal was examined for CRA
compliance in January 2000 and Security was examined in June 1999 and both
received a rating of "satisfactory."

Bank Holding Company Regulation

         General. Bank holding companies, such as First Midwest, are subject to
comprehensive regulation by the FRB under the BHCA and the regulations of the
FRB. As a bank holding company, First Midwest is required to file reports with
the FRB and such additional information as the FRB may require, and is subject
to regular inspections by the FRB. The FRB also has extensive enforcement
authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the
ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal
orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its
bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for
violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.

         Under FRB policy, a bank holding company must serve as a source of
strength for its subsidiary banks. Under this policy the FRB may require a
holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized
subsidiary bank.

         Under the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain FRB approval before:
(i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares
of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own
or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the
majority of such shares); (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets
of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with
another bank holding company.

         The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions,
from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the
voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or
from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking,
managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The
principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities
which, by statute or by FRB regulation or order, have been identified as
activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling
banks. The list of activities permitted by the FRB includes, among other things,
operating a savings institution (such as First Federal), mortgage company,
finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain
data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice;
underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of
credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating
basis; real estate and personal property appraising; and, subject to certain
limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. The scope of
permissible activities may be expanded from time to time by the FRB. Such
activities may also be affected by federal legislation.

         Interstate Banking and Branching. The FRB may approve an application of
an adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding company to acquire
control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located
in a state other than such holding company's home state, without regard to
whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The FRB may not
approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum
time period (not exceeding five years) specified by the statutory law of the
host state or if the applicant (and its depository institution affiliates)
controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United
States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank's home state or in any
state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Iowa has adopted a five year
minimum existence

                                       37

<PAGE>



requirement. States are authorized to limit the percentage of total insured
deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank or bank holding
company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state
banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30%
state-wide concentration limit.

         The federal banking agencies are also generally authorized to approve
interstate merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is
prohibited by the law of any state. Interstate acquisitions of branches or the
establishment of a new branch is permitted only if the law of the state in which
the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch
acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit
concentration amounts described above. Iowa permits interstate branching only by
merger.

         Dividends. The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash
dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the FRB's view that a bank
holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income
for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of
earning retention that is consistent with the holding company's capital needs,
asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB also indicated that it
would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to
borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action
regulations adopted by the FRB, the FRB may prohibit a bank holding company from
paying any dividends if the holding company's bank subsidiary is classified as
"undercapitalized."

         Bank holding companies are required to give the FRB prior written
notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the
gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net
consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12
months, is equal to 10% or more of their consolidated net worth. The FRB may
disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal
would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law,
regulation, FRB order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with,
the FRB. This notification requirement does not apply to any company that meets
the well-capitalized standard for commercial banks, has a safety and soundness
examination rating of at least a "2" and is not subject to any unresolved
supervisory issues.

         Capital Requirements. The FRB has established capital requirements for
bank holding companies that generally parallel the capital requirements for
commercial banks and federal thrift institutions such as First Federal and
Security. First Midwest is in compliance with these requirements.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

         First Federal and Security are both members of the FHLB of Des Moines,
which is one of 12 regional FHLBs, that administers the home financing credit
function of savings associations. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank
for its members within its assigned region. It makes loans to members (i.e.,
advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of
directors of the FHLB. These policies and procedures are subject to the
regulation and oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Board. All advances from
the FHLB are required to be

                                       38

<PAGE>



fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition,
all long-term advances must be used for residential home financing.

         As members of the FHLB System, First Federal and Security are required
to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines. At September 30, 2001,
the Banks had in the aggregate $6.4 million in FHLB stock, which was in
compliance with this requirement. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001,
dividends paid by the FHLB of Des Moines to First Federal and Security totaled
$421,000. Over the past five calendar years such dividends have averaged 6.76%
and were 4.70% for the first three quarters of the calendar year 2001.

         Under federal law the FHLBs are required to provide funds for the
resolution of troubled savings associations and to contribute to low- and
moderately priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on
advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing
projects. These contributions have affected adversely the level of FHLB
dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions
could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A
reduction in value of First Federal's FHLB stock may result in a corresponding
reduction in First Federal's capital.

Federal and State Taxation

         Federal Taxation. First Midwest and its subsidiaries file consolidated
federal income tax returns on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of
accounting. In addition to the regular income tax, corporations, including
savings banks such as First Federal, generally are subject to a minimum tax. An
alternative minimum tax is imposed at a minimum tax rate of 20% on alternative
minimum taxable income, which is the sum of a corporation's regular taxable
income (with certain adjustments) and tax preference items, less any available
exemption. The alternative minimum tax is imposed to the extent it exceeds the
corporation's regular income tax and net operating losses can offset no more
than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income.

         To the extent earnings appropriated to a savings bank's bad debt
reserves and deducted for federal income tax purposes exceed the allowable
amount of such reserves computed under the experience method and to the extent
of the bank's supplemental reserves for losses on loans ("Excess"), such Excess
may not, without adverse tax consequences, be utilized for the payment of cash
dividends or other distributions to a shareholder (including distributions on
redemption, dissolution or liquidation) or for any other purpose (except to
absorb bad debt losses). As of September 30, 2001, First Federal's Excess for
tax purposes totaled approximately $6.7 million.

         First Midwest and its consolidated subsidiaries have not been audited
by the IRS within the past ten years. In the opinion of management, any
examination of still open returns (including returns of subsidiaries and
predecessors of, or entities merged into, First Midwest) would not result in a
deficiency which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition
of First Midwest and its subsidiaries.

         Iowa Taxation.  First  Federal and  Security  file Iowa  franchise  tax
returns.  First Midwest and First Federal's subsidiary file Iowa corporation tax
returns on a fiscal year-end basis.


                                       39

<PAGE>



         Iowa imposes a franchise tax on the taxable income of mutual and stock
savings banks and commercial banks. The tax rate is 5%, which may effectively be
increased, in individual cases, by application of a minimum tax provision.
Taxable income under the franchise tax is generally similar to taxable income
under the federal corporate income tax, except that, under the Iowa franchise
tax, no deduction is allowed for Iowa franchise tax payments and taxable income
includes interest on state and municipal obligations. Interest on U.S.
obligations is taxable under the Iowa franchise tax and under the federal
corporate income tax. The taxable income for Iowa franchise tax purposes is
apportioned to Iowa through the use of a one-factor formula consisting of gross
receipts only.

         Taxable income under the Iowa corporate income tax is generally similar
to taxable income under the federal corporate income tax, except that, under the
Iowa tax, no deduction is allowed for Iowa income tax payments; interest from
state and municipal obligations is included in income; interest from U.S.
obligations is excluded from income; and 50% of federal corporate income tax
payments are excluded from income. The Iowa corporate income tax rates range
from 6% to 12% and may be effectively increased, in individual cases, by
application of a minimum tax provision.

         South Dakota Taxation. First Federal files a South Dakota franchise tax
return due to the operations of its Sioux Falls and Brookings divisions. The
South Dakota franchise tax is imposed only on depository institutions. First
Midwest, Security and First Federal's subsidiaries are therefore not subject to
the South Dakota franchise tax.

         South Dakota imposes a franchise tax on the taxable income of a
depository institution at the rate of 6%. Taxable income under the franchise tax
is generally similar to taxable income under the federal corporate income tax,
except that, under the South Dakota franchise tax, no deduction is allowed for
state income and franchise taxes, bad debt deductions are determined on the
basis of actual charge-offs, income from municipal obligations exempt from
federal taxes are included in the franchise taxable income, and there is a
deduction allowed for federal income taxes accrued for the fiscal year. The
taxable income for South Dakota franchise tax purposes is apportioned to South
Dakota through the use of a three-factor formula consisting of tangible real and
personal property, payroll and gross receipts.

         Delaware Taxation. As a Delaware holding company, First Midwest is
exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual
report with and pay an annual fee to the State of Delaware. First Midwest is
also subject to an annual franchise tax imposed by the State of Delaware.

Competition

         The Company faces strong competition, both in originating real estate
and other loans and in attracting deposits. Competition in originating real
estate loans comes primarily from commercial banks, savings banks, credit
unions, insurance companies, and mortgage bankers making loans secured by real
estate located in the Company's market area. Commercial banks and credit unions
provide vigorous competition in consumer lending. The Company competes for real
estate and other loans principally on the basis of the quality of services it
provides to borrowers, interest rates and loan fees it charges, and the types of
loans it originates.


                                       40

<PAGE>



         The Company attracts all of its deposits through its retail banking
offices, primarily from the communities in which those retail banking offices
are located; therefore, competition for those deposits is principally from other
commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions and brokerage offices located in
the same communities. The Company competes for these deposits by offering a
variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, and
convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges
at each.

         The Company serves Adair, Buena Vista, Calhoun, Guthrie, Ida,
Pocahontas, Polk and Sac counties in Iowa and Brookings, Lincoln and Minnehaha
counties in South Dakota. There are 33 commercial banks, four savings banks,
other than First Federal, and one credit union which compete for deposits and
loans in First Federal's primary market area in northwest Iowa and eight
commercial banks, one savings bank, other than First Federal, and one credit
union which compete for deposits and loans in First Federal's market area in
Brookings, South Dakota. In addition, there are twelve commercial banks in
Security's primary market area in west central Iowa. First Federal competes for
deposits and loans with numerous financial institutions located throughout the
metropolitan market areas of Des Moines, Iowa and Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Employees

         At September 30, 2001, the Company and its subsidiaries had a total of
155 employees, including 12 part-time employees. The Company's employees are not
represented by any collective bargaining group. Management considers its
employee relations to be good.

Executive Officers of the Company Who Are Not Directors

         The following information as to the business experience during the past
five years is supplied with respect to the executive officers of the Company who
do not serve on the Company's Board of Directors. There are no arrangements or
understandings between such persons named and any persons pursuant to which such
officers were selected.

         Donald J.  Winchell  - Mr.  Winchell,  age 49,  serves  as Senior  Vice
President,  Treasurer  and Chief  Financial  Officer of First  Midwest and First
Federal,  and is responsible for the formulation and  implementation of policies
and objectives for First Federal's finance and accounting functions.  His duties
include  financial   planning,   interest  rate  risk  management,   accounting,
investments,   financial  policy  development  and  compliance,   budgeting  and
asset/liability  management.  Mr.  Winchell  also serves as  Treasurer  of First
Services  Financial  Limited and Brookings  Service  Corporation.  Mr.  Winchell
joined First Federal in 1989 as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,  was
appointed Treasurer in 1990, and Senior Vice President in 1992. Prior to joining
First Federal,  Mr. Winchell served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer of Midwest  Federal  Savings  and Loan  Association  of  Nebraska  City,
Nebraska  since 1981. Mr.  Winchell  received a Bachelor of Science degree and a
Bachelor of Business  Administration  degree from Washburn  University,  Topeka,
Kansas. Mr. Winchell is a certified public accountant.

Item 2.   Description of Property

         The Company conducts its business at its main office and branch office
in Storm Lake, Iowa, and five other locations in its primary market area in
Northwest Iowa. The Company also operates two offices in Brookings, South
Dakota, through the Company's Brookings Federal Bank division of the Bank; three
offices in Des Moines, Iowa, through the Company's Iowa Savings Bank division of
the Bank; one office in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, through the Company's Sioux
Falls division of the Bank; and three offices in West Central Iowa through the
Company's Security State Bank subsidiary.

         The Company owns all of its offices, except for the branch offices
located at Storm Lake Plaza, Storm Lake, Iowa and West Des Moines, Iowa as to
which the land is leased. The total net book value of the Company's premises and
equipment (including land, building and leasehold improvements and furniture,
fixtures and equipment) at September 30, 2001 was $9.3 million. See Note 6 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

         The Company believes that its current facilities are adequate to meet
the present and foreseeable needs of the Company and the Banks. The Company has
initiated plans to construct a new office to be located in Urbandale, Iowa. The
construction of the Urbandale office is anticipated to be completed by the end
of the 2002 fiscal year.

         The Bank maintains an on-line data base with a service bureau, whose
primary business is providing such services to financial institutions. The net
book value of the data processing and computer equipment utilized by the Company
at September 30, 2001 was approximately $816,000.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

         The Company is involved as plaintiff or defendant in various legal
actions arising in the normal course of its business. While the ultimate outcome
of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of
management, after consultation with counsel representing Company in the
proceedings, that the resolution of these proceedings should not have a material
effect on Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

         No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders, through the
solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the quarter ended September 30,
2001.
