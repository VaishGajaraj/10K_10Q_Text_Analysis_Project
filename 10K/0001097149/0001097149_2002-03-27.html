<B><P>ITEM 1. BUSINESS.</P>
<I><P>Overview</P>
</B></I><P>We design, manufacture and market Invisalign&reg;, a
proprietary new method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth.
Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, removable appliances
that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on
the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign significantly reduces
the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces. Invisalign also
offers dental professionals a new means of carrying out their diagnosis and
treatment planning processes. We believe Invisalign has the potential to
transform the traditional practice of orthodontics by appealing to people who
would not otherwise seek treatment.</P>
<P>In the U.S. alone, over 200 million individuals have some form
of malocclusion. Each year, less than one percent of these individuals, or
approximately two million Americans, enter orthodontic treatment, spending
approximately $7 billion in the aggregate. We believe Invisalign is a compelling
treatment alternative for most of the patients who would seek traditional
orthodontic treatment. In addition, given the significant benefits of
Invisalign, we have the opportunity to expand the U.S. orthodontic market by
addressing the needs of millions of individuals who would not otherwise seek
treatment. Further, we believe the international opportunity is larger than the
U.S. opportunity.</P>
<P>We received FDA clearance to market Invisalign in 1998 and started
commercial sales in July 1999. Our 510(k) clearance from the FDA allows us to
market the Invisalign to treat patients with any type of malocclusion. We
voluntarily restrict the use of Invisalign to adults and adolescents with mature
dentition. Individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars
and substantially complete jaw growth. This group represents approximately 130
million people in the U.S. Typically, girls by the age of 13 years and boys by
the age of 16 years will have developed mature dentition. Currently, we do not
treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing, as the effectiveness
of Invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth
over the course of treatment. Based on our clinical studies to date, we
recommend that dental professionals use Invisalign as a complete treatment for a
broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for unusually
severe malocclusions. </P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Historically, we limited our training of dental professionals to
orthodontists in the U.S and Canada.  In October 2001, we expanded our training
in the U.S. and Canada to include dentists.  As of February 28, 2002, we had
trained over 12,000<B><I> </B></I>dental professionals worldwide to use
Invisalign.  Of those dental professionals trained, approximately<B> </B>80% are
dental professionals in the U.S. and Canada, which we consider our domestic
market.  Within our domestic market, we have trained over 7,300 orthodontists,
representing approximately 80% of all practicing orthodontists in the U.S. and
Canada, and over 2,300 dentists. As of February 28, 2002, over 4,300 of the
worldwide dental professionals we have trained had submitted one or more cases
to us, and over 44,000 patients have commenced treatment with Invisalign.</P>
<P>Our objective is to establish Invisalign as the standard method for treating
orthodontic malocclusion. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on educating
both consumers and dental professionals on the significant benefits of
Invisalign. We continue to train dental professionals and work with them to
increase the use of Invisalign within their practices. In September 2000, we
initiated a national advertising campaign to create awareness of Invisalign as a
treatment alternative and to stimulate demand for treatment with Invisalign. In
2001, we continued to advertise nationally using a broader marketing mix to
drive consumer and dental professional demand and to reinforce the breadth of
applicability of Invisalign.</P>
<B><I><P>Industry Background</P>
</I><P>Malocclusion</P>
</B><P>Malocclusion is one of the most prevalent clinical conditions, affecting
over 200 million individuals, or approximately 75% of the U.S. population.
Approximately two million people annually elect orthodontic treatment in the
U.S., generating industry revenues of approximately $7 billion. While most
individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance, malocclusion
may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay, tooth loss, gum
disease, jaw joint pain and headaches. Because of the compromised aesthetics,
discomfort and other drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic
treatments, only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek
treatment. </P>
<B><I><P>Traditional Orthodontic Treatment</P>
</B></I><P>Dental professionals today apply traditional techniques and
principles of orthodontic treatment developed in the early 20th century. In the
U.S., dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal archwires and
brackets, commonly referred to as braces. Occasionally, in an attempt to improve
treatment aesthetics, dental professionals use ceramic, tooth-colored brackets
or bond brackets on the inside, or lingual surfaces, of the patient's teeth.
Dental professionals also augment braces with elastics, metal bands, headgear
and other ancillary devices.</P>
<P>The average treatment takes approximately two years to complete and requires
several hours of direct dental professional involvement, or chair time. To
initiate treatment, a dental professional will diagnose a patient's condition
and create an appropriate treatment plan. In a subsequent visit, the dental
professional will bond brackets to the patient's teeth with cement and attach an
archwire to the brackets. Thereafter, by tightening or otherwise adjusting the
braces approximately every six weeks, the dental professional is able to exert
sufficient force on the patient's teeth to achieve desired tooth movement.
Because of the length of time between visits, the dental professional must
tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement
during the interval. In a final visit, the dental professional removes each
bracket and residual cement from the patient's teeth.</P>
<P>Fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between $3,000 to
$5,000 and are generally not reimbursed by insurance. In addition, dental
professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives.
Fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental
professional's estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance. A
treatment that exceeds the dental professional's estimate of chair time
generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time, or reduced
profitability for the dental professional.</P>
<B><P>Limitations of Traditional Orthodontic Treatment</P>
</B><P>Although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of
malocclusions, they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages.
Conventional orthodontic treatment is associated with: </P>
<I><P>Unattractive appearance</I>. Braces call attention to the patient's
condition and treatment. In addition, braces trap food, which can further
compromise appearance. Braces can also result in permanent discoloration of
teeth. Many adults associate braces with adolescence. As a result of these and
other limitations, less than one half of one percent of American adults with
malocclusion elect orthodontic treatment annually. </P>
<I><P>Oral discomfort</I>. Braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and
irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth. The tightening or adjustment of
braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort, especially in the days
after an orthodontic visit. </P>
<I><P>Poor oral hygiene</I>. Braces compromise oral hygiene by making it more
difficult to brush and floss. These problems can result in tooth decay and
periodontal damage. Additionally, the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause
permanent markings on the teeth. </P>
<I><P>Inability to project treatment</I>. Historically, dental professionals
have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment.
Accordingly, dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan
and project treatment. As a result, they cannot be precise about the direction
or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits. This lack of
predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental
professional's ability to estimate the duration of treatment. Because most
orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis, extended treatment
duration reduces profitability for the dental professional. </P>
<I><P>Physical demands on dental professional</I>. The manipulation of wires and
brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity, and may place
other physical burdens on the dental professional. </P>
<I><P>Root resorption</I>. The sustained high levels of force associated with
conventional treatment can result in root resorption, a shortening of tooth
roots. This shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for
the patient. </P>
<I><P>Emergencies</I>. At times, braces need to be repaired or replaced on an
emergency basis. Such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the
patient and the dental professional. </P>
</FONT><p>Due to the poor aesthetics, discomfort and other limitations of
braces, relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic
treatment. Accordingly, we believe there is a large unmet need for an
orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns. We also believe there
is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that
increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice
profitability.</p>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=2><P>The Align Solution</P>
</B></I><P>Invisalign is a proprietary new system for treating malocclusion.
Invisalign consists of two components: ClinCheck&trade; and Aligners.</P>
<I><P>ClinCheck.</I> ClinCheck is an interactive Internet application that
allows dental professional to diagnose and plan treatment for their patients. We
use a dental impression and a treatment prescription submitted by a dental
professional to develop a customized, three-dimensional treatment plan that
simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two-week increments.
ClinCheck allows the dental professional to view this three-dimensional
simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle. Accordingly,
ClinCheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level
of accuracy not previously possible.</P>
<P>Upon review of the ClinCheck simulation, the dental professional may
immediately approve our projected treatment, or may provide us with feedback for
modification. We reflect any requested adjustments in a modified simulation.
Upon the dental professional's approval of the ClinCheck simulation, we use the
data underlying the simulation to manufacture the patient's Aligners. </P>
<I><P>Aligners</I>. Aligners are custom-manufactured, clear, removable dental
appliances that, when worn in prescribed series, provide orthodontic treatment.
Each Aligner covers a patient's teeth and is nearly invisible when worn.
Aligners are commonly worn in pairs, over the upper and lower dental arches.
Aligners are generally worn for consecutive two-week periods which correspond to
the approved ClinCheck treatment simulation. After two weeks of use, the patient
discards the Aligners and replaces them with the next pair in the series. This
process is repeated until the final Aligners are used and treatment is complete.
Upon completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or her
discretion, prescribe that the patient wear the final Aligner as a retainer.
</P>
<b>
<P>Benefits of Invisalign</P>
</B></I><P>We believe that Invisalign provides benefits to patients and dental
professionals that have the potential to establish Invisalign as the preferred
alternative to conventional braces. </P>
<B><P>Benefits to the Patient</P>
</B><I><P>Excellent aesthetics</I>. Aligners are nearly invisible when worn,
eliminating the aesthetic concerns associated with conventional braces. </P>
<I><P>Comfort</I>. By replacing the six-week adjustment cycle of traditional
braces with two-week stages, Aligners move teeth more gently. Also, Aligners are
thin, smooth and low in profile. As a result, Aligners are substantially more
comfortable and less abrasive than conventional braces. </P>
<I><P>Improved oral hygiene</I>. Patients can remove Aligners for tasks that are
difficult with conventional braces, such as eating, brushing and flossing. We
believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay and periodontal
damage during treatment. </P>
<I><P>Potentially reduced overall treatment time</I>. Aligners control force by
distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth. In addition, the
ClinCheck simulation from which Aligners are produced is designed to reduce
unintended and unnecessary tooth movements. Together, these factors may
significantly reduce overall treatment time relative to conventional braces.
</P>
<I><P>Potentially reduced root resorption</I>. We believe that controlling force
and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root
resorption. </P>
<I><P>Reduced incidence of emergencies</I>. Typically, a lost or broken Aligner
is simply replaced with the next Aligner in series, minimizing inconvenience to
both patient and dental professional. </P>
<P>We believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently
do not seek treatment because of the limitations of conventional braces.</P>
<B><P>Benefits to the dental professional</B> </P>
<I><P>Ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes</I>. We believe that
ClinCheck is the only product that enables dental professionals to preview a
course of treatment and the likely final outcome of treatment in an interactive
three-dimensional computer model. ClinCheck allows dental professionals to
analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the alternative they
feel is most appropriate for the patient. </P>
<I><P>Minimal additional training</I>. The biomechanical principles that
underlie Invisalign are consistent with those of traditional orthodontics.
Dental professionals can complete our initial training and certification program
within a day. </P>
<I><P>Ease of use</I>. When treating patients with Invisalign, dental
professionals do not spend their time manipulating wires and brackets. This
allows them to spend proportionately more time diagnosing and interacting with
their patients. </P>
<I><P>Significantly expanded patient base</I>. We believe Invisalign has the
potential to transform the practice of orthodontics. Currently, less than one
percent of the over 200 million people with malocclusion in the U.S. enter
treatment each year. We believe that Invisalign will allow dental professionals
to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment. </P>
<I><P>Higher fees</I>. Dental professionals typically charge between $3,000 and
$5,000 for a course of conventional treatment. Due to the substantial patient
benefits of Invisalign, we believe dental professionals offering Invisalign have
generally been able to command a significant premium. In our experience, the
premiums charged by dental professionals for Invisalign have been comparable to
other treatment alternatives that attempt to improve the aesthetics of
conventional braces, such as ceramic and lingual braces. </P>
<I><P>Decreased dental professional and staff time</I>. Invisalign reduces both
the frequency and length of patient visits. Invisalign eliminates the need for
time-intensive processes such as bonding appliances to the patient's teeth,
adjusting archwires during the course of treatment and removing the appliances
at the conclusion of treatment. As such, use of Invisalign significantly reduces
dental professional and staff chair time and can increase practice throughput.
</P>
<P>We believe the combination of increased patient volume, higher fees per case
and reduced chair time has the potential to substantially improve orthodontic
practice profitability.</P>
<P> </P>
<B><I><P>Limitations of Invisalign</P>
</B></I><P>In some instances, Invisalign may have certain limitations relative
to conventional treatment. Aligners cost more to produce than conventional
braces, and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the
supplies used in conventional treatment. Depending on the individual pricing
policies of each dental professional, the cost of Invisalign to the patient may
be greater than for conventional braces. Dental professionals must also
incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan.
Once a dental professional submits a case to us, there is generally a turn-
around time of a month or more before the corresponding Aligners are delivered.
Aligners may not be appropriate for all cases, such as unusually severe
malocclusion, which may require Aligners to be used in combination with
conventional braces for optimal results. In addition, because Aligners are
removable, treatment using Invisalign depends on patients wearing their Aligners
as recommended. Some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to
wearing Aligners that may mildly affect speech.  We believe that these
limitations are outweighed by the many benefits of Invisalign to both patients
and dental professionals.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><I><P>Our Target Market</P>
</B></I><P>Commercial sales of Invisalign commenced in the U.S. in July 1999. As
of February 28, 2002, approximately 44,000 patients have entered treatment using
Invisalign.</P>
<P>Our 510(k) clearance from the FDA allows us to market Invisalign to treat
patients with any type of malocclusion. We voluntarily restrict the use of
Invisalign to adults and adolescents with mature dentition. Individuals with
mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially complete jaw
growth. This group represents approximately 130 million people in the U.S.
Typically, girls by the age of 13 years and boys by the age of 16 years will
have developed mature dentition. Currently, we do not treat children whose teeth
and jaws are still developing, as the effectiveness of Invisalign relies on our
ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of
treatment. Based on our clinical studies to date, we recommend that dental
professionals use Invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of
malocclusions and as a component of treatment for unusually severe
malocclusions.</P>
<P>Approximately two million patients enter into traditional orthodontic
treatment in the U.S. annually. These patients represent less than one percent
of the population of people with malocclusion. Of these, over 50%, or more than
one million patients, have mature dentition and are therefore natural candidates
for Invisalign.</P>
<P>In addition, we believe that we have an immediate and substantial market
expansion opportunity. Our market research indicates that the vast majority of
people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment
because of its many limitations. We believe that by addressing the primary
limitations of braces, Invisalign will encourage this group to seek treatment.
Adults, who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of
traditional treatment, represent our most significant market expansion
opportunity. </P>
<P>We continue to focus on the domestic market opportunity and have expanded our
focus on selected international markets, as we believe a large international
market opportunity exists. </P>
<B><I><P>Business Strategy</P>
</B></I><P>Our objective is to establish Invisalign as the standard method for
treating orthodontic malocclusion. Key elements of our strategy include the
following: </P>
<I><P>Educate dental professionals and stimulate demand for Invisalign
treatment</I>. Our market research indicates that the vast majority of people
with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment
because of its many limitations. By communicating the benefits of Invisalign to
both dental professionals and consumers, we intend to significantly increase the
number of patients who seek orthodontic treatment annually. We successfully
tested consumer advertising in two lead markets and in September 2000 initiated
a national advertising campaign in order to create awareness of Invisalign as a
treatment alternative and to establish the Invisalign brand name. In 2001, we
continued to advertise nationally using a broader marketing mix to drive
consumer and dental professional demand and to reinforce the breadth of
applicability of Invisalign. In October 2001, we expanded our training of dental
professionals in our domestic market to include dentists.  As of February 28,
2002, we had trained over 12,000 dental professionals worldwide on the use and
benefits of Invisalign. </P>
<I><P>Communicate practice benefits of Invisalign to dental professionals</I>.
Invisalign provides substantial financial incentives to dental professionals by
enabling them to increase patient volume, charge a premium price and reduce
chair time per treatment. We intend to continue to emphasize these practice
benefits to dental professionals through our sales and training efforts.</P>
<I><P>Expand and enhance manufacturing capability</I>. Our manufacturing
operations are designed to produce large numbers of custom Aligners at a high
level of quality. To improve cost efficiency, we conduct labor intensive
processes in relatively low wage countries. We intend to maintain manufacturing
capacity in excess of projected demand to reduce the risk that manufacturing
capacity constrains our ability to grow. Our proprietary software underlies our
manufacturing process. By continually developing this software and other
manufacturing processes, we plan to increase the level of production automation.
Increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce both unit costs
and production times. </P>
<I><P>Extend and defend technology leadership</I>. Invisalign represents a
significant technological advancement in orthodontics. We believe that our
issued patents, multiple pending patents and other intellectual property provide
us with a substantial lead over potential competitors. One of our issued U.S.
patents is written to broadly cover any algorithmic method of segmenting
orthodontic treatment into a sequence of three or more steps, based on
calculated initial and final representations of a patient's dentition. We
continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through U.S. and
foreign patent applications and non-disclosure agreements. We also seek to
protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade
secret and copyright laws. </P>
<I><P>Expand our target patient base</I>. Invisalign can provide complete
treatment for patients with mature dentition and a broad range of malocclusion.
In addition, we believe that Invisalign can provide partial treatment of
unusually severe malocclusions. In an effort to demonstrate Invisalign's ability
to comprehensively treat such cases, we initiated the publication of a series of
clinical case studies and articles that highlight the applicability of
Invisalign to malocclusion cases of even severe complexity. We are also
undertaking post-marketing studies and making additional improvements to the
product.</P>
<I><P>Build an international presence</I>.<B> </B>Initially, we focused our
sales and marketing efforts on the U.S. and Canadian market opportunities. While
we continue to focus on this domestic market, we have begun to introduce
Invisalign in selected international markets. We believe that potential
international demand for Invisalign exceeds that of our domestic market.</FONT>
</P>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=2><P>Manufacturing</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We produce highly customized, close tolerance,
medical quality products in volume. To do so, we have developed a number of
proprietary processes and technologies. These technologies include complex
software solutions, destructive and white light scanning techniques,
stereolithography and automated Aligner fabrication.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe the complexity inherent in producing such highly
customized devices in volume is a barrier to potential competitors. Furthermore,
we believe the sophisticated software we use to guide a custom manufacturing
process on a large scale was not available until we developed it. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Manufacturing is coordinated in Santa Clara, California,
where, as of December 31, 2001, we employed a manufacturing staff of
approximately 135 people. In addition, we employed a software development team
comprising approximately 30 software engineers with backgrounds in computational
geometry, animation, computer-aided design and various manufacturing industries.
We also employ approximately 500 software operators and other staff in our
facilities in Lahore, Pakistan, who are responsible for the creation of
treatment simulations. In late 2001, we began developing operations in the
United Arab Emerites (&quot;U.A.E.&quot;) and Costa Rica, which will also create
treatment simulations. In addition, we outsource the fabrication and packaging
of Aligners to a contract manufacturer based in Juarez, Mexico. </P>
<B><I><P>The Invisalign Treatment Process</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Invisalign treatment process comprises the following
five stages: </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data
to us.</I> In an initial patient visit, the dental professional determines
whether Invisalign is an appropriate treatment. The dental professional then
prepares treatment data which consists of an impression of the relevant dental
arches, x-rays of the patient's dentition, photographs of the patient, a wax
bite depicting the relationship between the patient's upper and lower dental
arches and an Invisalign treatment planning form, or prescription. The
impression is a critical component as it depicts the three-dimensional geometry
of the patient's teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models. An
impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material. This material
hardens, capturing the shape of the patient's teeth. The prescription is also a
critical component, describing the desired positions and movement of the
patient's teeth. The dental professional sends the treatment data to our Santa
Clara facility. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Preparation of three-dimensional computer models of the
patient's initial malocclusion</I>. Upon receipt, we use the treatment data to
construct plaster models of the patient's dentition. We scan the plaster models
to develop a digital, three-dimensional computer model of the patient's current
dentition. We then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental
professional's prescription electronically to our facilities in Lahore,
Pakistan</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Preparation of computer-simulated treatment and viewing of
treatment using ClinChe</I>ck. In Pakistan we transform this initial model into
a customized, three-dimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth
movement in a series of two-week increments. This simulation is then reviewed
for adherence to prescribed clinical, treatment, and quality standards. Upon
passing review, the simulation is then delivered to the prescribing dental
professional via ClinCheck on our website at www.invisalign.com. The dental
professional then reviews the ClinCheck simulation on a computer and, on
occasion, asks us to make adjustments. By reviewing and amending the treatment
simulation, the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and,
thus, participates in the customized design of the Aligners. At this point, the
dental professional may also invite the patient to review ClinCheck, allowing
the patient to see the projected course of treatment. The dental professional
then approves the proposed treatment and, in doing so, engages us for the
manufacture of corresponding Aligners. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Construction of molds corresponding to each step of
treatment.</I> We use the approved ClinCheck simulation to construct a series of
molds of the patient's teeth. Each mold is a replica of the patient's teeth at
each two-week stage of the simulated course of treatment. These molds are
fabricated at our Santa Clara facility using custom manufacturing techniques
that we have adapted for use in orthodontic applications. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Manufacture of Aligners and shipment to the dental
professional.</I> We ship these molds to Juarez, Mexico, where our contract
manufacturer fabricates Aligners by pressure forming polymeric sheets over each
mold. The Aligners are then trimmed, polished, cleaned, packaged and, following
final inspection, shipped directly to the prescribing  dental professional. In
certain cases, dental professionals may use Invisalign in conjunction with clear
attachments bonded to the patient's teeth. These attachments are used to
increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the
Aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement. </P>
<P>Historically, we have shipped Aligners in batches. The first batch, which
typically represented the first several months of treatment, was produced once
the prescribing dental professional approved ClinCheck. Thereafter, Aligners
were sent at approximately six month intervals until completion of treatment. In
mid-February 2001, for cases where ClinCheck was approved, we began shipping all
the Aligners in a single batch. In addition, we began accelerating the shipments
of Aligners for cases where ClinCheck was approved prior to mid-February
2001.</P>
</FONT><H5>Throughput Management</H5>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because we manufacture each case on a build-to-order
basis, we cannot build inventories. As a result, we must conservatively
build manufacturing throughput for anticipated demand. To increase throughput,
we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing
processes. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing
processes, we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of
rate-limiting processes, or bottlenecks. In 2001 we upgraded our proprietary,
three-dimensional treatment-planning software to enhance computer analysis of
treatment data, which reduced time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each
case and thereby increased the efficiency of our technicians in Pakistan. We are
also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication of
Aligners currently conducted in Mexico. In order to scale our manufacturing
capacity, we continue to invest in facilities and capital equipment.</FONT> </P>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=2><P>Quality Assurance</P>
</B></I><P>Our quality assurance system is compliant with FDA Medical Device
regulations 21CFR Part 820, and during 2001, we achieved certification to ISO
9001:1994, an internationally recognized quality system.  Our system defines
processes and procedures to ensure product and service quality, and includes
methods to monitor levels of quality, based on internal data and direct customer
feedback.  We utilize this data to continuously improve our systems and
processes, taking corrective action as required.</P>
<P>We custom manufacture Aligners on a build-to-order basis so we do not offer
refunds on our products. Because each ClinCheck and each Aligner is unique, we
inspect 100% of the product at various points in the manufacturing process, to
ensure that the product meets our customer's expectations. However, Aligners are
subject to the Invisalign product warranty, which covers defects in materials
and workmanship. Defective or broken Aligners must be returned to us for credit
evaluation. In the event that returned Aligners fall within the scope of the
Invisalign product warranty, we will replace the Aligners at our expense. Our
warranty is contingent upon proper use of the Aligners for the purposes for
which they are intended. If a patient chooses not to wear the Aligners, and as a
result, requests additional Invisalign treatment, the dental professional pays
for the additional expense. </P>
<P>The Invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the
outcome of treatment using Invisalign. However, if actual treatment results
deviate significantly from the approved ClinCheck treatment plan, the dental
professional may request a mid-course correction under the Invisalign product
warranty. These deviations have typically been the result of unpredictable
biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and
abnormal jaw growth. A mid-course correction requires that the dental
professional submit new molds of the patient's dentition to us. We use the molds
to create a new ClinCheck treatment plan for the dental professional to approve,
from which a successive series of Aligners will be produced that will allow the
patient to finish treatment. Under the Invisalign product warranty, we will
provide patients with one mid-course correction at our expense to address
significant deviations from the approved ClinCheck treatment plan.</P>
<P>In the event that a dental professional wishes to effect additional
adjustments to a patient's treatment when the actual treatment results are in
accordance with the approved ClinCheck treatment plan, the dental professional
may request a mid-course correction or additional Aligners. However, in these
cases, the mid-course correction and additional Aligners are provided at the
dental professional's expense. In addition, should a dental professional request
a replacement for a lost Aligner, we charge the dental professional for the cost
of the replacement Aligner. </P>
<B><I><P>Sales and Marketing</P>
</B></I></FONT><p>We market Invisalign by communicating Invisalign's benefits
directly to consumers and dental professionals with a nationwide advertising
campaign. Based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales in our
test markets, we believe that making consumers aware of Invisalign as a new
treatment alternative generates significant demand for Invisalign. In order to
serve anticipated worldwide demand, we are training a broad base of dental
professionals. </p>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Consumer Marketing</P>
</B><P>Our national consumer marketing efforts primarily focus on television
advertising and are supported by print, event marketing, public relations and
direct mail campaigns. We tested our consumer marketing strategy in two markets,
Austin, Texas and San Diego, California. Based on the positive results of these
initial marketing efforts, in September 2000, we launched a nationwide consumer
marketing campaign to create awareness and stimulate demand for Invisalign. In
2001 we continued to advertise nationally using a broader marketing mix to drive
consumer and dental professional demand and to reinforce the breadth of
applicability of Invisalign. </P>
<P>Our experience indicates that prospective patients exposed to our advertising
seek information from four primary sources: </P>

<UL>
<LI>a general practice dentist; </LI>
<LI>an orthodontist; </LI>
<LI>our toll-free support line (1-800-INVISIBLE); and </LI>
<LI>our website (www.invisalign.com). </LI></UL>

<P>Our marketing efforts have generated substantial consumer interest directed
toward our telephone support line and our website.<B><I> </B></I>Our telephone
support line and our website not only provide consumers with information on
Invisalign, but, importantly, also allow us to channel consumer interest to
dental professionals of our choice. Traditionally we have outsourced the
telephone support function to a large national call center operator. During
2001, we transitioned this function in-house. We maintain the outsourced
function for back-up and peak periods.</P>
<B><P>Professional Marketing</P>
</B><P>Professional marketing consists of training dental professionals and
assisting them in building their practices. As of December 31, 2001, our sales
team consisted of 32 salespeople experienced in orthodontic product sales.
Approximately 31 technical support staff, together with the marketing department
and our in-house orthodontic staff, support the sales team. Our sales and
support staff has been engaged in marketing Invisalign to orthodontists since
July 1999. In October 2001, through our partner Discus Dental, we began
marketing Invisalign to general dentists in our domestic market. Under a five
year marketing agreement, Discus Dental will act as our exclusive Invisalign
marketing and sales representative providing training, certification, marketing
and clinical support to general dentists in the U.S. and Canada.</P>
<P>As of February 28, 2002, we had trained over 12,000<B><I> </B></I>dental
professionals worldwide to use Invisalign.  Of those dental professionals
trained, approximately<B> </B>80% are dental professionals in the U.S. and
Canada, which we consider our domestic market.  Within our domestic market, we
have trained over 7,300 orthodontists, representing approximately 80% of all
practicing orthodontists in the U.S. and Canada, and over 2,300 dentists. As of
February 28, 2002, over 4,300 of the worldwide dental professionals we have
trained had submitted one or more cases to us, and over 44,000 patients have
commenced treatment with Invisalign. Our sales and orthodontic teams conduct
training primarily in a workshop format. The key topics covered in training
include Invisalign applicability, instructions on filling out the Invisalign
prescription form, guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our
ClinCheck software and the many other features of our website. </P>
<P>Invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to
traditional treatment, and we present our training material in a manner
consistent with dental professionals' training and experience. As a result, we
are able to complete these training workshops within one day. Our success in
training a large number of dental professionals confirms our belief that
training represents a minimal barrier to adoption for most dental professionals.
</P>
<P>After training, sales representatives follow up with the dental professional
to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle Invisalign cases. Such follow
up may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions,
establishing an Internet connection and familiarizing them with our website.
Sales representatives may also provide practice-building assistance, including
helping the dental professional market to local general practice dentists and to
prospective patients through direct mail or other media. Indeed, many practices
have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance.
</P>
<P>We have developed a system of tiering dental professionals that encourages
our sales force to devote more time to those dental professionals most
proficient in the use of Invisalign. </P>
<P>We use objective criteria, primarily the number of cases initiated with
Invisalign, to tier dental professionals. Inquiries from prospective patients
through our customer call center and our website are directed to higher tier
dental professionals. We believe the tiering process will rapidly increase the
penetration of our product within selected dental professionals' offices.</FONT>
</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>General dentists play an important role in informing their
patients about orthodontics and are a key source of both referrals to
orthodontists and Invisalign case submissions. There are over 120,000 active
general practice dentists in the U.S. and Canada.  Through our agreement with
Discus Dental, we educate these general dentists and staff to encourage them to
recommend Invisalign to their patients. </P>
<B><I><P>Research and Development</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of December 31, 2001, our research and development
team consisted of 21 individuals with medical device development, orthodontic
and other relevant backgrounds. Prior to commercial launch in July 1999, our
research and development strategy had three primary objectives: developing
Invisalign, establishing the ability of Invisalign to treat malocclusion and
developing software and processes to enable the manufacture of Aligners in
volume. Since our commercial launch, our research and development effort has
focused on extending the range of dental applicability of Invisalign, enhancing
the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our line of
products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an effort to demonstrate Invisalign's broad treatment
capabilities, we initiated the publication of a series of clinical case studies
and articles that highlight the applicability of Invisalign to malocclusion
cases of even severe complexity. We are also undertaking post-marketing studies
and making additional improvements to the product. In 2001, we upgraded our
proprietary, three-dimensional treatment-planning software primarily to increase
our manufacturing capacity and efficiency. Our product development team is
testing enhanced materials and a number of complementary products that we expect
will provide additional revenue opportunities. </P>
<B><I><P>Intellectual Property</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe our intellectual property position
represents a substantial business advantage. As of February 28, 2002, we have
nine issued U.S. patents, 11 issued foreign patents, 52 pending U.S. patent
applications, and 121 pending foreign patent applications. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We continue to pursue further intellectual property
protection through U.S. and foreign patent applications and non-disclosure
agreements. We also seek to protect our software, documentation and other
written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. We cannot be certain
that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that
patents that have been issued to us or may issue in the future will be found to
be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products.
</P>
<B><I><P>Competition</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not aware of any company that has developed or
is marketing a system comparable to Invisalign. However, we compete for the
attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of other orthodontic
products. These suppliers include manufacturers of traditional orthodontic
appliances such as 3M Company, Sybron Dental Specialities, Ormco and Dentsply
International, Inc. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe that, in addition to price, the principal
competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the
following factors: </P>

<UL>
<LI>aesthetic appeal of the treatment method; </LI>
<LI>comfort associated with the treatment method; </LI>
<LI>effectiveness of treatment; </LI>
<LI>ease of use; and </LI>
<LI>dental professionals' chair time. </LI></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe that Invisalign compares favorably with respect to
each of these factors. </P>
<B><I><P>Government Regulation</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FDA Regulation of Medical Devices</I>. Invisalign is
regulated as a medical device. Accordingly, our product development, labeling,
manufacturing processes and promotional activities are subject to extensive
review and rigorous regulation by government agencies in countries in which we
sell our products. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the U.S., the FDA regulates the design, manufacture,
distribution, preclinical and clinical study, clearance and approval of medical
devices. Medical devices are classified in one of three classes on the basis of
the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness.
Class I or II devices require the manufacturer to submit a pre-market
notification requesting permission for commercial distribution, which is known
as 510(k) clearance. Class III devices, which are deemed by the FDA to pose
greater risk than Class I and II devices, require FDA approval of a pre-market
approval application which includes, among other things, extensive preclinical
and clinical trial data and information about the device's and its components'
design, manufacturing and labeling. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Invisalign is a Class I device, the least stringent class,
which only requires general controls, including labeling, pre-market
notification and adherence to the FDA's Quality System regulations. In addition,
because Invisalign is a Class I device, we are required to register contract
manufacturers located outside the U.S. with the FDA. Accordingly, we have
registered our Mexico-based contract manufacturer, Elamex. Elamex is certified
under ISO, an internationally recognized quality standard, and also performs
subcontractor manufacturing for other U.S.-based medical device companies. Our
quality system and procedures are set up to comply with all FDA regulations.
Elamex has dedicated an area in its facilities and personnel for our exclusive
use. We have supplied Elamex with procedures for how to manufacture and ship our
products and have trained Elamex's personnel, thus assuring compliance with FDA
regulations as long as the procedures are followed. We conduct frequent visits
to the Mexico facility to monitor Elamex's performance and its compliance with
our procedures. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In November 1998, Invisalign received 510(k) Pre-Market
Notification by the FDA, allowing us to market Invisalign in the U.S. The
manufacture and distribution of Invisalign are subject to continuing regulation
by the FDA. We are subject to routine inspections by the FDA to determine
compliance with facility registration, product listing requirements, medical
device reporting regulations and Quality System requirements. The Quality System
regulation is similar to good manufacturing practices and relates to product
testing and quality assurance, as well as the maintenance of records and
documentation. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, it can
institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us, ranging from a
public Warning Letter to more severe sanctions, including but not limited to
financial penalties, withdrawal of 510(k) pre-market notification clearances
already granted, and criminal prosecution. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Europe, Invisalign is regulated as a custom device. As
such, we will not be subject to regulations promulgated by the European
Community, although we have the option to CE mark our product. We achieved
certification to ISO 9001:1994 in fiscal 2001, which facilitates the
commercialization of Invisalign outside the U.S. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Federal and State Laws.</I> As a participant in the
health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing
regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the
federal, state and local levels, some of which are, and others of which may be,
applicable to our business. Furthermore, our health care service provider
customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could
affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care
providers cover a broad array of subjects. For example, the confidentiality of
patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information
may be released for inclusion in our databases, or released by us to third
parties, are subject to substantial regulation by state governments. These state
laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential
patient medical information and are evolving rapidly. In addition, provisions of
the Social Security Act prohibit, among other things, paying or offering to pay
any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person
participating in, or for the order, purchase or recommendation of items or
services that are subject to reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and similar
other federal or state health care programs. Most states have also enacted
illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws. These laws are
applicable to our financial relationships with, and any marketing or other
promotional activities involving, our dental professional customers. Finally,
various states regulate the operations of an advertising and referral service
for dentists, and may require registration of such services with a state agency
as well as compliance with various requirements and restrictions on how they
conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists.
Violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of
civil and criminal sanctions. </P>

<B><I><FONT SIZE=2><P>Factors That May Affect Operating Results</P>
</B></I></FONT><H5>Since we have a history of losses and negative operating cash
flows, and we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase, we may not
achieve or maintain profitability in the future.</H5>
<p>We have incurred significant operating losses, negative operating cash
flows and have not achieved profitability. From inception through July 2000, we
spent significant funds in organizational and start-up activities, recruiting
key managers and employees, developing Invisalign and developing our
manufacturing and customer support resources. We also spent significant funds on
clinical trials and training programs to train dental professionals in the use
of Invisalign. We expect to have net losses and negative operating cash flows
for at least the next 12 months.</p>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>We intend to increase our operating expenses as we continue
to:</P>

<UL>
<LI>scale our manufacturing operations; </LI>
<LI>develop new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing
processes; </LI>
<LI>execute our national direct to consumer marketing campaign; </LI>
<LI>increase the size of our sales force and dental professional training
staff;</LI>
<LI>expand our manufacturing operations from Pakistan to additional relatively
lower wage countries, including the U.A.E. and Costa Rica; </LI>
<LI>increase our international sales and marketing efforts; </LI>
<LI>undertake quality assurance and improvement initiatives; and </LI>
<LI>increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing
operations. </LI></UL>

<P>As a result, we will need to increase our revenue significantly, while
controlling our expenses, to achieve profitability. It is possible that we will
not achieve profitability, and even if we do achieve profitability, we may not
sustain or increase profitability in the future.</P>
<B><P>We may be unable to raise additional capital if it should be necessary,
which could harm our ability to compete.</P>
</B><P>We have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash
flows since inception and have not achieved profitability. As of December 31,
2001, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $206.1 million.</P>
<P>We expect to expend significant capital to establish a national brand, build
manufacturing infrastructure and develop both product and process technology. We
believe that the existing cash balances, the proceeds from our initial public
offering in January 2001 and other potential financing alternatives will be
sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next
12 months.</P>
<P>We are currently working towards our objective of realizing profitability by
achieving the key goal of successfully marketing our product throughout our
domestic market and internationally, while controlling our expenses. The failure
to win increased acceptance by orthodontists and dentists of Invisalign could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial conditions.</P>
<P>If we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows, we may need to
seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing,
collaborative or other arrangements with other companies, bank financing and
other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or
equity financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not
available, we could be required to delay establishing a national brand, building
manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology,
or to reduce our expenditures in general. Accordingly, the failure to obtain
sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.</P>
<B><P>We have a limited operating history and expect our future financial
results to fluctuate significantly, which may cause our stock price to
decline.</P>
</B><P>We were incorporated in April 1997 and began sales of Invisalign in July
1999. Thus, we have a limited operating history, which makes an evaluation of
our future prospects and your investment in our stock difficult. In addition, we
expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we
increase our commercial sales. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to
decline. Some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate
include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>changes in the timing of product orders; </LI>
<LI>unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity, any
disruptions in the manufacturing process or in the introduction of new
production processes; </LI>
<LI>inaccurate forecasting of revenue, production and other operating costs; and
</LI>
<LI>the development and marketing of directly competitive products by potential
competitors.</LI></UL>

<P>To respond to these and other factors, we may need to make business decisions
that could adversely affect our operating results. Most of our expenses, such as
employee compensation and lease payment obligations, are relatively fixed in the
short term. Moreover, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations
regarding future revenue levels. As a result, if our revenue for a particular
period falls below our expectations, we may be unable to adjust spending quickly
enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in
revenue levels.</P>
<P>Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely
on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future
performance.</P>
<B><P>We have limited product offerings, and if demand for Invisalign declines
or fails to develop as we expect, our revenue will decline.</P>
</B><P>We expect that revenue from the sale of Invisalign will continue to
account for a substantial portion of our total revenue. Continued and widespread
market acceptance of Invisalign is critical to our future success. Invisalign
may not achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect, or at all,
which could reduce our revenue.</P>
</FONT><H5>If dental professionals do not adopt Invisalign in sufficient numbers
or as rapidly as we anticipate, our operating results will be harmed.</H5>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>As of December 31, 2001, approximately 3,700 orthodontists have
submitted one or more cases to us. Our success depends upon increasing
acceptance by orthodontists and dentists of Invisalign. Invisalign requires
dental professionals and their staff to undergo special training and learn to
interact with patients in new ways and to interact with us as a supplier. In
addition, because Invisalign has only been in clinical testing since July 1997
and commercially available since July 1999, dental professionals may be
reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available.
Also, increasing adoption by dental professionals will depend on factors such as
the capability, safety, efficacy, ease of use, price, quality and reliability of
our products and our provision of effective sales support, training and service.
In the future, unanticipated poor clinical performance of Invisalign could
result in significant adverse publicity and consequently in reduced acceptance
by dental professionals. If Invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in
the orthodontic and dental communities, our operating results will be
harmed.</P>
<B><P>If consumers do not adopt Invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly
as we anticipate, our operating results will be harmed.</P>
</B><P>Invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic
treatment, and patients may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it
preferable to conventional treatment. In addition, patients may not comply with
recommended treatment guidelines which could compromise the effectiveness of
their treatment. While we have generally received positive feedback from both
dental professionals and patients regarding Invisalign as both an alternative to
braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion, our success will
depend upon the rapid acceptance of Invisalign by the substantially larger
number of potential patients to which we are now actively marketing. We have had
a limited number of complaints from patients and prospective patients generally
related to shipping delays and minor manufacturing irregularities. Market
acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dentists and
orthodontists, as well as other factors including effectiveness, safety,
reliability, improved treatment aesthetics and greater comfort and hygiene
compared to conventional orthodontic products. Furthermore, consumers may not
respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching
our target audience. Adoption by consumers may also be impacted by general
macroeconomic conditions and levels of consumer confidence and consumer
spending. If consumers prove unwilling to adopt Invisalign as rapidly or in the
numbers that we anticipate, our operating results will be harmed.</P>
<B><P>We are dependent on our international manufacturing operations, which
exposes us to foreign operational and political risks that may harm our
business.</P>
</B><P>Two of our key production steps are performed in manufacturing operations
located outside the U.S. We currently rely on our facilities in Pakistan to
create electronic treatment plans with the assistance of sophisticated software.
In late 2001, we also began developing facilities in the U.A.E. and Costa Rica,
which will perform these functions. We employ approximately 500 people in
Lahore, Pakistan, most of who are Pakistani, in this effort. In addition, we
rely on third party manufacturers in Mexico to fabricate Aligners and to ship
the completed product to customers. Our reliance on international operations
exposes us to risks and uncertainties, including:</P>

<UL>
<LI>political, social and economic instability; </LI>
<LI>acts of war and acts of terrorism, particularly in light of the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001; </LI>
<LI>difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; </LI>
<LI>controlling quality of manufacture; </LI>
<LI>interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services; </LI>
<LI>product or material transportation delays or disruption; </LI>
<LI>burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional
laws;</LI>
<LI>trade restrictions and changes in tariffs; </LI>
<LI>import and export license requirements and restrictions; </LI>
<LI>fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and </LI>
<LI>potential adverse tax consequences.</LI></UL>

<P>If any of these risks materialize, our operating results may be harmed.</P>
<B><P>Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are
unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive
position may be harmed.</P>
</B><P>Our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing
intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property
protection for our products, both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our
inability to do so could harm our competitive position. As of February 28, 2002,
we have nine issued U.S. patents and 52 pending U.S. patent applications. We
have 11 foreign-issued patents and 121 pending foreign patent applications. We
intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the
U.S. and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property
and our competitive position. However, our currently pending or future patent
filings may not issue as patents. Additionally, any patents issued to us may be
challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, circumvented, or may not be
sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products
similar in design to our products. In addition, protection afforded by foreign
patents may be more limited than that provided under U.S. patents and
intellectual property laws.</P>
<P>We also rely on protection of copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and
proprietary information. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with
our employees, consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a
relationship with us. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful
protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or
other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if
unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur. Our inability to maintain the
proprietary nature of our technology through patents, copyrights or trade
secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth
prospects. In particular, a failure of our proprietary rights might allow
competitors to copy our technology, which could adversely affect pricing and
market share.</P>
<B><P>If we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties, our
ability to grow our business will be severely limited.</P>
</B><P>Extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights
is common in the medical device industry. We have been sued for infringement of
another party's patent in the past and, while that action has been dismissed, we
may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future.</P>
<P>In January 2000, Ormco Corporation filed suit against us asserting an
infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243. The complaint sought
unspecified monetary damages and equitable relief. The complaint alleged that
Invisalign infringed certain claims of the two patents relating to computer
modeling of an ideal dentition and the production of orthodontic appliances
based upon the ideal dentition. The suit has been dismissed but can be
recommenced under certain circumstances. See "Item 3--Legal Proceedings." If the
Ormco suit were recommenced and if Ormco were to prevail, we would have to seek
a license from Ormco, which license might not be available on commercially
reasonable terms or at all. In that event, we could be subject to damages or an
injunction, which could materially adversely affect our business.</P>
<P>From time to time, we have received and may again receive letters from third
parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. While we do not believe
that we infringe any valid and enforceable rights which have been brought to our
attention, there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently
unaware. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits,
interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could
result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our
technical and management personnel. An adverse determination in a patent suit by
Ormco or in any other litigation or interference proceeding to which we may
become a party could subject us to significant liabilities. An adverse
determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being
invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third
parties. Licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at
all, in which event, our business would be materially adversely affected.</P>
<B><P>We currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our
manufacturing process, and if our access to these inputs is diminished, our
business may be harmed. </P>
</B><P>We currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process. We rely
on a third party manufacturer in Mexico to fabricate Aligners and to ship the
completed product to customers. In addition, third party rapid prototyping
bureaus fabricate some molds from which the Aligners are formed. As a result, if
any of our third party manufacturers fail to deliver their components or if we
lose their services, we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner
and our business may be harmed. Finding substitute manufacturers may be
expensive, time-consuming or impossible. Although we are in the process of
developing the capability to fabricate all molds and Aligners internally, we may
not be successful and may continue to rely on outsourcing in the future.</P>
<P>In addition, we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning
equipment, rapid prototyping machines, resin and other advanced materials. We
maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials
technologies. Our rapid growth may exceed the capacity of these manufacturers to
produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support
our growth. In the event of delivery delays or shortages of these items, our
business and growth prospects may be harmed.</P>
<B><P>We are growing rapidly, and our failure to manage this growth could harm
our business. We have experienced significant growth in recent periods.</P>
</B><P>Our headcount increased from approximately 50 employees as of June 30,
1999 to approximately 1,100 employees as of December 31, 2001. We expect that
our growth will place significant demands on our management and other resources
and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational,
financial and other internal controls both in the U.S. and internationally. In
particular, continued growth increases the challenges involved in a number of
areas, including: recruiting and retaining sufficient skilled personnel,
providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality
standards, and preserving our culture and values. Our inability to manage this
growth effectively would harm our business.</P>
<B><P>If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key
personnel, we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our
products.</P>
</B><P>We are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering
and management teams. The loss of the services of those individuals may
significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and
other business objectives and could harm our business. Our future success will
also depend on our ability to identify, recruit, train and retain additional
qualified personnel. There is currently a shortage of skilled clinical,
engineering and management personnel and intense competition for these
personnel, especially in Silicon Valley where our headquarters is located. In
addition, few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing
environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices,
universities and other research institutions. Thus, we may be unable to attract
and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further
development of our business. Furthermore, we may not be successful in retaining
our key personnel or their services.</P>
<B><P>We experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and
expect aggressive competition in the future.</P>
</B><P>We are not aware of any company that is marketing or developing a system
directly comparable to Invisalign. However, manufacturers of traditional braces,
such as 3M Company, Sybron Dental Specialities and Dentsply International, Inc.
have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing
experience than we do and may, in the future, attempt to develop an orthodontic
system similar to ours. Large consumer products companies may also enter the
orthodontic supply market. Furthermore, we may face competition in the future
from new companies that may introduce new technologies. We may be unable to
compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render
our technology obsolete or economically unattractive. If we are unable to
compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any
products developed by our competitors, our business will be harmed.</P>
<B><P>Complying with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other
regulations is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to
comply could result in substantial penalties.</P>
</B><P>Our products are medical devices and subject to extensive regulation in
the U.S. and internationally. FDA regulations are wide ranging and govern, among
other things:</P>

<UL>
<LI>product design, development, manufacture and testing; </LI>
<LI>product labeling; </LI>
<LI>product storage; </LI>
<LI>pre-market clearance or approval; </LI>
<LI>advertising and promotion; and </LI>
<LI>product sales and distribution.</LI></UL>

<P>Noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in
enforcement action which may include recalling products, ceasing product
marketing, and paying significant fines and penalties, which could limit product
sales, delay product shipment and adversely affect our profitability.</P>
<P>In the U.S., we must comply with facility registration and product listing
requirements of the FDA and adhere to applicable Quality System regulations. The
FDA enforces its Quality System regulations through periodic unannounced
inspections, which we have yet to undergo. If we or any third party manufacturer
of our products do not conform to applicable Quality System regulations, we may
be required to find alternative manufacturers, which could be a long and costly
process.</P>
<P>Before we can sell a new medical device in the U.S., we must obtain FDA
clearance or approval, which can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. Even
though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the FDA
through the pre-market notification provisions of Section 510(k) of the federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, we may be unable to maintain the necessary
clearances in the future. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain the necessary
clearances for new devices that we market in the future.</P>
<B><P>Extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry
may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial
government penalties.</P>
</B><P>In addition to medical device laws and regulations, numerous state and
federal healthcare-related laws regulate our business, covering areas such as:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>storage, transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare
records; </LI>
<LI>prohibitions against the offer, payment or receipt of remuneration to induce
referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods; and </LI>
<LI>the marketing and advertising of our products.</LI></UL>

<P>Complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time-
consuming, and could increase our costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our
activities or our revenues.</P>
<B><P>We face risks related to our international operations, including the need
to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals.</P>
</B><P>Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to foreign regulatory
requirements that vary widely from country to country. The time required to
obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than
that required for FDA clearance or approval, and requirements for such approvals
may differ from FDA requirements. We may be unable to obtain regulatory
approvals in other countries. We may also incur significant costs in attempting
to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals. If we experience
delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the U.S., or if
we fail to receive these approvals, we may be unable to market our products or
enhancements in international markets in a timely manner, if at all. We have
recently launched sales of our product in Germany, France and the U.K. and
intend to further expand our international operations. We do not know whether
orthodontists, dentists and consumers will adopt Invisalign in sufficient
numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate.</P>
<B><P>Our business exposes us to risks of product liability claims, and we may
incur substantial expenses if we are sued for product liability.</P>
</B><P>Medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and
associated adverse publicity. We may be held liable if any product we develop or
any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or
is otherwise found unsuitable. Although we intend to continue to maintain
product liability insurance, adequate insurance may not be available on
acceptable terms and may not provide adequate coverage against potential
liabilities. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual
outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs. These costs would have
the effect of increasing our expenses and could harm our business.</P>
<B><P>The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.</P>
</B><P>The trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and
could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors,
many of which are beyond our control, including:</P>

<UL>
<LI>quarterly variations in our results of operations; </LI>
<LI>changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates
of our revenues or operating results; </LI>
<LI>speculation in the press or investment community; </LI>
<LI>strategic actions by our competitors, such as product announcements or
acquisitions; and </LI>
<LI>general market conditions.</LI></UL>

<P>In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology and
medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and
volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the
operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry
factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of
our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the
market price of a company's securities, class action litigation has often been
brought against the company. If a securities class action suit is filed against
us, we would incur substantial legal fees and our management's attention and
resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to
the litigation.</P>
<B><P>Concentrations of ownership and agreements among our existing executive
officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders
from influencing significant corporate transactions.</P>
</B><P>The interest of management could conflict with the interest of our other
stockholders. As of December 31, 2001, our executive officers, directors and
principal stockholders beneficially owned, in total, approximately 47.7% of our
outstanding common stock. These stockholders, if acting together, would be able
to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval, including
the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.
This could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the
Company, which in turn could reduce the market price of our stock.</P>
<B><P>ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California.
We lease approximately 90,000 square feet of space where we house our
manufacturing, customer support, software engineering and administrative
personnel. The leases for our facilities expire between 2002 and 2005. The
combined monthly rent for the Santa Clara facilities is approximately $270,000.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We operate two facilities in Pakistan, both in the city of
Lahore. The main facility comprises over 5,000 square feet of office space. The
lease for this facility expires at the end of 2002. The second facility
comprises over 10,000 square feet of office space. The lease for this facility
expires in August 2010.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of December 31, 2001 we have committed $1.2 million in

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <A NAME="item3"></A><B>ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In February 2001 Align Technology was named in a class
action lawsuit filed on behalf of all licensed dentists (excluding
orthodontists) in the U.S. The complaint alleged that Align Technology's policy
of selling Invisalign exclusively to orthodontists violated the U.S. antitrust
laws. Without admitting any wrongdoing, the company entered into a Stipulation
and Agreement of Settlement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The total
legal and other settlement costs that Align has agreed to pay are approximately
$400,000. Pursuant to the settlement, Align will undertake to train and certify
5,000 general practice dentists each year over the next four years. In November
2001, the Court approved the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 2000, Ormco Corporation filed suit against us
asserting infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243. The
complaint sought unspecified and monetary damages and injunctive relief. In
March 2000, we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a
declaration by the Court of invalidity and non-infringement of the asserted
patents. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 2000, we entered into a Stipulation of Dismissal with
Ormco. Ormco agreed for a period of at least two years not to pursue litigation
with respect to these patents, except as set forth below. Further, Ormco agreed
that it would not bring any patent action against us for at least a period of
one year with respect to any as yet unissued patents. If Ormco were to bring
such an action concerning as yet unissued patents after one year, the
Stipulation of Dismissal would allow Ormco to include in such an action claims
involving U.S. Patent Nos. 5,447,432 and 5,683,243. In August 2001, Ormco
notified us of the issuance of U.S. Patent No. 6,244,861 and offered a license
for this patent. No assurance can be given that Ormco will not bring another
action against us or, that if brought, it will not be successful. Should the
suit be recommenced and should our technology be found to infringe, we would
have to seek a license from Ormco, which license might not be available on
commercially reasonable terms or at all. In that event, we could be subject to
damages or an injunction which could materially adversely affect our business.
It is possible that, depending on the scope of any new patents that are issued
to Ormco, Ormco will bring another patent action after a period of one year has
passed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The claims at issue in the Ormco suit relate to methods and
systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances. The
relevant claims are limited to the calculation of the final positioning of a
patient's teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient.
The treatment plan simulation developed in our Pakistan facilities determines
the final positioning of a patient's teeth but is not based on a derived or
ideal dental archform of the patient. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From time to time, we have received, and may again receive,
letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights. While
we do not believe that we infringe any such rights which have been brought to
our attention, there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are
presently unaware. <A NAME="item4"></A></P>

<B><P>ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.</B> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read together with "Selected
Consolidated Financial Data" and our consolidated financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K. This discussion
and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks,
uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many
factors, including but not limited to those set forth under "Factors That May
Affect Operating Results" and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K. </P>
<B><I><P>Overview</P>
</B></I></FONT><p>From our inception in April 1997 to July 2000, we were
engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of Invisalign, a proprietary
new system for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. In July
1999, we commenced commercial sales of Invisalign. Prior to July 1999, we
devoted nearly all our resources to developing our software and manufacturing
processes, clinical trials of Invisalign and to building our sales force,
customer support and management teams. We exited the development stage in July
2000. </p>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Invisalign has two components: ClinCheck and
Aligners. ClinCheck is an Internet-based application that allows dental
professionals to simulate treatment, in three dimensions, by modeling two-week
stages of tooth movement. Aligners are thin, clear plastic, removable dental
appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two-week
stage of the ClinCheck simulation. Aligners are customized to perform the
treatment prescribed for an individual patient by a dental professional using
ClinCheck. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the third quarter of 1999, we recognized revenue for the
first time from the sale of Invisalign and related dental impression machines
manufactured by ESPE America, Inc. We expect to sell dental impression machines
to an orthodontist only once, if at all. Accordingly, sales of such machines are
expected to represent a lower proportion of our revenue in the future.
Substantially all our revenue is generated in the U.S. and Canada, which, taken
together, we regard as our domestic market. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While our expansion outside of our domestic market is still
in the initial stages, we do incur substantial operating costs outside of our
domestic market. Two of our key production steps are performed in operations
located outside of the U.S. In our facilities in Pakistan, technicians use a
sophisticated, internally developed computer-modeling program to prepare
electronic treatment plans, which are transmitted via the Internet back to the
U.S. These files form the basis of our ClinCheck product and are used for the
manufacture of Aligner molds. In addition, a third party manufacturer in Mexico
fabricates and performs finishing work on completed Aligners and ships the
completed products to our customers. Our costs associated with these operations
are denominated in Pakistani rupees and Mexican pesos. Our reliance on
international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect
our business or results of operations including, among others, political, social
and economic instability, acts of war or terrorism, difficulties in staffing and
managing international operations, controlling quality of manufacture,
interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services, product or material
transportation delays or disruption, and trade restrictions and changes in
tariffs. However, we believe these risks are mitigated in Pakistan by the fact
that our operations there do not involve the shipping or manufacturing of any
physical products, and in late 2001, we began developing facilities in the
U.A.E. and Costa Rica which will also perform this function. We believe the
risks in Mexico are mitigated by the fact that our operations there are governed
under the provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. </P>
</FONT><p>In October 2001, we entered into an exclusive marketing agreement
with Discus Dental Impressions, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, Discus
will act as our exclusive Invisalign marketing and sales representative
providing training, certification, marketing and clinical support to general
dentists in the U.S. and Canada. Discus is required to maintain minimum sales
quotas and will earn a commission on all products shipped under the terms of the
agreement.  We are required, under the terms of the agreement, to provide
minimum consumer advertising commensurate with Discus meeting minimum sales
quotas.  The initial term of the agreement expires December 31, 2006, but is
renewable for five years if not terminated earlier.  The agreement includes
termination rights for convenience and for failure to meet agreed upon minimums.
</p>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not been profitable for any quarter
since April 3, 1997 (inception). As of December 31, 2001, we had an accumulated
deficit of $206.1 million. We expect to have net losses and negative operating
cash flows for at least the next 12 months due, in part, to our national
consumer advertising campaign, the expansion of manufacturing capacity, our
launching  of our international sales and marketing efforts and continued
research and development efforts. We will need to generate significant revenue
growth to achieve profitability and positive operating cash flow. Even if we do
achieve profitability and positive cash flow, we may not be able to sustain or
increase profitability or positive operating cash flow on a quarterly or annual
basis. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We earn revenue primarily from the sale of Invisalign. Our
revenue consists of the ClinCheck fee and the charge for each Aligner. We charge
dental professionals a fixed fee for the treatment simulation viewed via
ClinCheck on our website, www.Invisalign.com. This fee is invoiced when the
dental professional orders ClinCheck prior to the production of Aligners. In
addition, we charge dental professionals a fee for Aligners upon shipment. </P>
</FONT><p>Historically, we have shipped Aligners in batches. The first batch,
which typically represented the first several months of treatment, was produced
once the prescribing dental professional approved ClinCheck. Thereafter,
Aligners were sent at approximately six month intervals until completion of
treatment. In mid-February 2001, for cases where ClinCheck was approved, we
began shipping all the Aligners in a single batch. </p>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>Fees from the sale of ClinCheck and Aligners, taken together,
are treated as revenues from a single Invisalign case.  For cases where
ClinCheck was approved prior to mid-February 2001, revenues associated with a
given case are recognized ratably as batches of Aligners are shipped to the
dental professional.  For orders placed subsequent to notification of our change
to single batch shipments, all of the revenues associated with a given case,
including ClinCheck fees, will be recognized at the time the Aligners are
shipped. The costs of producing the ClinCheck treatment plan, which are incurred
prior to the production of Aligners, are capitalized and recognized as related
revenue is earned. In the cases where</FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>we expect a net loss,
the entire loss is recognized immediately.</P>
<B><I><P>Results of Operations</P>
</I><P>Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000:</P>
</B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revenues</I>. Revenues for the year ended December 31,
2001 increased to $46.4 million compared to $6.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, revenues of $45.0
million were derived from the sale of Invisalign compared to revenues of $5.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The balance of our revenues for
year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 represented sales of dental impression
machines, other products and training. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cost of revenues</I>. Cost of revenues includes the
compensation of staff involved in production, the cost of materials and
packaging used in production and shipping, together with an allocation of the
cost of facilities and depreciation on the capital equipment used in the
production process. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001
increased to $46.8 million compared to $20.3 million for the year ended December
31, 2000. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 2000
includes $10.6 and $11.2 million, respectively, of unabsorbed manufacturing
costs due to an increase in our manufacturing capacity in 2001 and 2000. For the
third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2001, we achieved positive gross margins
mainly due to efficiencies achieved in manufacturing as well as reducing over
capacity in many areas. Our gross loss is affected by changes in manufacturing
volume, manufacturing capacity and changes in our pricing policies. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sales and marketing</I>. Sales and marketing expenses
include sales force compensation together with the expense of professional
marketing - principally, conducting training workshops and market surveys,
advertising and attending orthodontic trade shows. Sales and marketing expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased to $50.6 million compared to
$40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase resulted
primarily from: increases in headcount and related expenses of approximately
$4.6 million; expenses relating to increased direct mailings of $1.4 million;
and expenses related to the expansion of our international sales and marketing
offices of $5.7 million. Partially offsetting the increase was a $2.4 million
decrease in advertising expenses.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General and administrative</I>. General and administrative
expenses include costs for the compensation of administrative personnel, outside
consulting services, facilities, legal expenses and general corporate expenses.
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001
increased to $32.7 million compared to $18.0 million for the year ended December
31, 2000, primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses. We expect
administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future to support
expanding business activities and the additional administrative costs related to
being a public company. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and development</I>. Research and development
expenses include the cost for the compensation of staff, the costs associated
with software engineering, the costs of designing, developing and testing our
products and the conduct of both clinical and post-marketing trials. Research
and development is expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses for
the year ended December 31, 2001 increased to $14.7 million compared to $9.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase resulted primarily
from increases in headcount and related expenses of approximately $3.3
million.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Litigation settlement</I>. In February 2001 Align
Technology was named in a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of all licensed
dentists (excluding orthodontists) in the U.S. The complaint alleged that Align
Technology's policy of selling Invisalign exclusively to orthodontists violated
the U.S. antitrust laws. Without admitting any wrongdoing, the company entered
into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement with the plaintiffs to settle the
lawsuit. The total legal and other settlement costs that Align has agreed to pay
are approximately $400,000. Pursuant to the settlement, Align will undertake to
train and certify 5,000 general practice dentists each year over the next four
years. In November 2001, the Court approved the Stipulation and Agreement of
Settlement.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other income (expense), net</I>. Other income was $1.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to expense of $7.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2000. The interest income in fiscal 2001 was
generated from higher average cash and cash equivalents balance and investments
in short-term and long-term securities in fiscal 2001, which included the
proceeds from our initial public offering completed in January 2001. Partially
offsetting the interest income was a non-cash interest expense of $1.8 million,
recorded in January 2001, related to the beneficial conversion feature embedded
in convertible subordinated notes. The other expense balance of $7.6 million as
of December 31, 2000 was primarily the result of non-cash interest expense
related to the beneficial conversion feature of a bridge loan financing.</P>
<I><P>Dividend related to beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock</I>.
In 2000 we issued 9,535,052 shares of Series D preferred stock which were
subject to an antidilution conversion price adjustment feature which we
triggered when we granted options to purchase our common stock beyond the number
of options that were authorized under our 1997 Plan at the time we commenced our
Series D preferred stock offering in May 2000. The conversion feature provided
that if, during the period between May 12, 2000 (the commitment date for our
Series D preferred stock offering) and the earlier of the closing of an initial
public offering or January 31, 2001, we had granted more than an aggregate of
3,331,978 options to purchase our common stock, then the conversion price of our
Series D preferred stock would be adjusted downward from its original conversion
price of $10.625 per share.  As of the end of January 2001, we had granted an
aggregate of 3,591,458 options to purchase shares of our common stock in excess
of the 3,331,978 options permitted, and we were therefore required to issue an
additional 790,342 shares of common stock upon the conversion of the Series D
preferred stock. These shares were in addition to the<B> </B>419,700 additional
shares of common stock that we were required to issue upon conversion of the
Series D preferred stock as of December 31, 2000. As a result, we recorded a
deemed dividend for the year ended December 31, 2001 based on the fair value of
the common stock at the commitment date of the Series D preferred stock offering
of $11.2 million related to the preferred stock sold and a charge to interest
expense of $1.8 million for the beneficial conversion feature embedded in
convertible subordinated notes that were previously converted.</P>
</FONT><I><p>Deferred Compensation</I>. In connection with the grant of stock
options to employees and non-employees, we recorded deferred stock-based
compensation as a component of stockholders' equity (deficit). Deferred stock-
based compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between
the fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and
their exercise price. For stock options granted to non-employees, the fair value
of the options, estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, is initially
recorded on the date of grant. As the non-employee options become exercisable,
we revalue the remaining unvested options, with the change in fair value from
period to period represented as a change in the deferred compensation charge.
This stock-based compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the
vesting periods of the options. We recorded amortization of deferred
compensation of $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $13.4
million, for the year ended December 31, 2000. </p>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999:</P>
</B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revenues</I>. Revenues for the year ended December 31,
2000 increased to $6.7 million compared to $411,000 for the year ended December
31, 1999. We recorded revenues for the first time in the third quarter of 1999.
For the year ended December 31, 2000, revenues of $5.4 million were derived from
the sale of Invisalign compared to revenues of $98,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The balance of our revenues for year ended December 31, 2000
and 1999 represented sales of dental impression machines. We expect to sell a
dental impression machine to an orthodontist only once, if at all. Accordingly,
sales of these machines are expected to represent a substantially lower
proportion of our revenue in the future. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cost of revenues</I>. Cost of revenues includes the
salaries of staff involved in production, the cost of materials and packaging
used in production and shipping together with an allocation of the cost of
facilities and depreciation on the capital equipment used in the production
process. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased to
$20.3 million compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes $11.2 million of
unabsorbed manufacturing costs due to a substantial increase in our
manufacturing capacity in 2000. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sales and marketing</I>. Sales and marketing expenses
include sales force compensation together with the expense of professional
marketing- principally, conducting training workshops and market surveys,
advertising and attending orthodontic trade shows. Sales and marketing expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased to $40.4 million compared to $5.7
million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase resulted primarily
from: increases in advertising expenses of $19.1 million; increases in headcount
and related expenses of $6.2 million; expenses relating to participation in the
annual convention of the American Association of Orthodontists of $1.9 million;
expenses relating to orthodontist training of $1.3 million; and expenses related
to the outsourced call center function to support our national advertising
campaign of $1.0 million. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General and administrative</I>. General and administrative
expenses include costs for the compensation of administrative personnel, outside
consulting services, facilities, legal expenses and general corporate expenses.
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000
increased to $18.0 million compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December
31, 1999, primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses. We expect
administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future to support
expanding business activities and the additional administrative costs related to
being a public company. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and development</I>. Research and development
expenses include the costs associated with software engineering, the costs of
designing, developing and testing our products and the conduct of both clinical
and post-marketing trials. Research and development is expensed as incurred.
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased
to $9.2 million compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Expenses through the third quarter of 1999, until we recognized revenue for the
first time from the sale of Invisalign, include the costs of researching
processes to manufacture our product. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other income (expense), net</I>. Other expense increased
to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to other expense
of $710,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase, partially
offset by interest income on marketable securities, resulted primarily from non-
cash interest expense related to the beneficial conversion feature embedded in
convertible subordinated notes.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dividend related to beneficial conversion feature of
preferred stock</I>. In 2000 we issued 9,535,052 shares of Series D preferred
stock.  The difference between the conversion price and the fair value per share
of the common stock on the commitment date for that offering resulted in a
beneficial conversion feature of $53.5 million which has been reflected as a
preferred stock dividend in the December 31, 2000 consolidated financial
statements.</P>
</FONT><I><p>Deferred Compensation</I>. In connection with the grant of stock
options to employees and non-employees, we recorded deferred stock-based
compensation as a component of stockholders' deficit. Deferred stock-based
compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair
value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their
exercise price. For stock options granted to non-employees, the fair value of
the options, estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, is initially
recorded on the date of grant. As the non-employee options become exercisable,
we revalue the remaining unvested options, with the change in fair value from
period to period represented as a change in the deferred compensation charge.
This stock-based compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the
vesting periods of the options. We recorded amortization of deferred
compensation of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and $394,000
for the year ended December 31, 1999. </p>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Income Taxes</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have incurred immaterial amounts of income tax expense
to date since we have not been profitable. As of December 31, 2001, we have
aggregate federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $312.5 million.
As of December 31, 2001 we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our
existing net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their
realization. We also have aggregate federal and state research tax credit
carryforwards of $3.1 million as of December 31, 2001. The federal and state net
operating loss and research credit carryforwards expire beginning in the year
2017 for federal and 2005 for state purpose if not utilized. Utilization of the
federal net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited by the
change of ownership provisions contained in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code. </P>
<B><I><P>Liquidity and Capital Resources</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prior to our initial public offering, we financed our
operations primarily through private sales of approximately $128.9 million of
convertible preferred stock. We have also financed our operations through
equipment leases and bank loans. In January 2001, we received proceeds, net of
underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses incurred, as a result
of our initial public offering of approximately $126.0 million. As of December
31, 2001, we had $65.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and
long-term marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of $206.1 million.
Additionally, we have $723,000 of restricted cash as of December 31, 2001. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Net cash used in operating activities totaled $77.9 million
in 2001, $58.8 million in 2000 and $11.6 million in 1999. The increase was
primarily due to the increase in our net loss to $97.5 million in fiscal 2001,
which is up from $88.7 million in fiscal 2000 and $15.4 million in fiscal 1999,
and to a lesser extent, increases in accounts receivable. This was offset
significantly by increased non-cash charges related to amortization of deferred
stock compensation and depreciation and amortization. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2.0 million in
2001, $41.6 million in 2000 and $3.6 million in 1999. For fiscal 2001, cash used
in investing activities was primarily the result of the investment of the
initial public offering proceeds in marketable securities. Offsetting the cash
used was cash provided by the maturities and sales of the marketable securities,
as well as the decrease in our restricted cash balance. For fiscal 2000 cash
used in investing activities was primarily used for the investment of the
proceeds from the sale of preferred stock in marketable securities.
Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2000, there was a substantial
increase in restricted cash of $15.6 million which primarily consisted of cash
related to the transfer of funds to our media buying agent to fund our national
advertising campaign. Offsetting the cash used was cash provided by the
maturities and sales of the marketable securities. For fiscal 1999 cash used in
investing activities was primarily the result of the investment of the proceeds
from the sale of preferred stock in marketable securities. Additionally, in each
of these years, there was a use of cash for the purchase of clinical and
manufacturing equipment, computers and facilities to support the expansion of
our operations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Net cash from financing activities was $127.5 million in
2001, $96.4 million in 2000 and $19.6 million in 1999. For fiscal 2001, cash
provided by financing activities was attributable primarily to net proceeds from
the issuance of common stock principally through our initial public offering.
For fiscal 2000 and 1999, cash provided by financing activities was attributable
to the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and convertible promissory
notes that were converted to preferred stock. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We finance capital purchases through cash and capital leases.
We had capitalized lease obligations outstanding of $1.5 million at December 31,
2001 and $1.9 million at December 31, 2000. </P>
<P>Our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our
ability to market sell and support our products on a worldwide basis. We believe
that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investment
balances will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12
months. If we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows, we may need
to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing,
collaborative or other arrangements with other companies, bank financing and
other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or
equity financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not
available, we could be required to delay establishing a national brand, building
manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology,
or to reduce our expenditures in general. Accordingly, the failure to obtain
sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Historical quarterly operating results do not necessarily
reflect our expectations of future quarterly operating results. We believe that
future operating results will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of
factors, including: the rate of adoption of Invisalign for the treatment of
orthodontic malocclusion, the rate which manufacturing operations is scaled, the
timing of automation of manufacturing processes and the extent of national
direct to consumer marketing campaigns. </P>
<B><I><P>Critical Accounting Policies</P>
</B></I></FONT><p>Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of financial
statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosures
at the date of the financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to accounts receivable, warranty accrual and
income taxes. We use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and
other assumptions as the basis for making estimates. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.</p>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements. We recognize revenues from product sales when
there is pervasive evidence that an arrangement exits, delivery has occurred,
the price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers and other adjustments are
provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded
based upon analyses of historical discounts and rebates. We accrue for estimated
warranty costs upon shipment of products. Our warranty policy is effective for
shipped products which are considered defective or fail to meet the product
specifications. We maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated
amount of losses that may result from customer's inability to pay for product
purchased. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
allowances may be required. We have established a valuation allowance to reduce
our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized. We account for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 109, &quot;<I>Accounting for Income
Taxes</I>.&quot; Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases
of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which thee differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation
allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amounts expected to be realized.</P>
<B><I><P>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</P>
</B></I><P>In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(&quot;FASB&quot;) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141
(&quot;SFAS 141&quot;), <I>&quot;Business Combinations,&quot;</I> which
establishes financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and
supersedes APB Opinion No. 16, <I>Business Combinations,</I> and FASB Statement
No. 38, <I>Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased
Enterprises</I>. It requires that all business combinations in the scope of this
Statement are to be accounted for using one method, the purchase method. The
provisions of this Statement apply to all business combinations initiated after
September 30, 2001, and also applies to all business combinations accounted for
using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001, or
later. To date, the Company has not engaged in a business combination.</P>
<P>In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
142 (&quot;SFAS 142&quot;), <I>"Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets</I>,<I>"</I> which establishes financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17,
<I>Intangible Assets.  </I>It addresses how intangible assets that are acquired
individually or with a group of other assets (but not those acquired in a
business combination) should be accounted for in financial statements upon their
acquisition, and after they have been initially recognized in the financial
statements. The provisions of this Statement are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001.  The Company will adopt SFAS 142 during
fiscal year 2002.  To date, the Company has not recorded goodwill or other
intangible assets.    </P>
<P>In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "<I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-
Lived Assets</I>," which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2001 and interim periods within those fiscal periods. This Statement
supersedes FASB Statement No. 121 and APB 30, however, this Statement retains
the requirement of Opinion 30 to report discontinued operations separately from
continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity
that either has been disposed of (by sale, by abandonment, or in a distribution
to owners) or is classified as held for sale. This Statement addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long-lived assets and for
long-lived assets to be disposed of.  Management does not expect the adoption of
SFAS 144 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position and
results of operations.</P>
<P>In May 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 00-
14, &quot;<I>Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives</I>.&quot; EITF Issue No.
00-14 addresses the recognition, measurement, and income statement
classification for sales incentives that a vendor voluntarily offers to
customers (without charge), which the customer can use in, or exercise as a
result of, a single exchange transaction. Sales incentives that fall within the
scope of EITF Issue No. 00-14 include offers that a customer can use to receive
a reduction in the price of a product or service at the point of sale. The EITF
agreed to change the transition date for Issue 00-14, dictating that a company
should apply this consensus no later than the Company's annual or interim
financial statements for the periods beginning after December 15, 2001. In June
2001, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 00-25<I>, &quot;Vendor Income Statement
Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's
Products</I>,&quot; effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2001.
EITF Issue No. 00-25 addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller
is an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor's products and, therefore,
should be deducted from revenue when recognized in the vendor's statement of
operations or a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from
the reseller and, therefore, should be included as a cost or expense when
recognized in the vendor's statement of operations. Upon application of these
EITFs, financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes
should be reclassified to comply with the income statement display requirements
under these Issues. In September of 2001, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 01-
09<I>, &quot;Accounting for Consideration Given by Vendor to a Customer or a
Reseller of the Vendor's Products</I>&quot;, which is a codification of EITF
Issues No. 00-14, No. 00-25 and No. 00-22 &quot;<I>Accounting for `Points' and
Certain Other Time- or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers and Offers for Free
Products or Services to be Delivered in the Future</I>.&quot; The Company is
currently assessing the impact of the adoption of these issues on our financial
statements. </P>

operations, primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk. These
risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course
of business. We do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of
our marketable securities or our debt instruments. We have no holdings of
derivative or commodity instruments. </P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interest Rate Risk</I>. We are subject to interest rate
risks on cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale marketable securities,
existing long-term debts and any future financing requirements. Interest rate
risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our
marketable securities portfolio. The long-term debt at December 31, 2001
consists only of outstanding balances on lease obligations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fair value of our investment portfolio or related income
would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the
marketable securities maturities do not exceed fiscal year 2002 and the interest
rates are primarily fixed. Our capital lease obligations of $1.5 million at
December 31, 2001 carry a fixed interest rate of 6.53% and 11.15% per annum with

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS </P>
<P>Note 1 Organization</P>
<I><P>Formation and business of the Company</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Align Technology, Inc., (the "Company") was
incorporated in April 1997 and is engaged in the development, manufacturing and
marketing of Invisalign, used for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of
teeth. Invisalign uses a series of clear plastic "Aligners" to move the
patients' teeth in small increments from their original state to a final treated
state. The Company exited the development stage as of July 2000. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In January 2001, the Company completed an initial public
offering of 10 million shares of common stock at $13.00 per share. In March
2001, the underwriters exercised an overallotment option for 628,706 shares. Net
proceeds to the Company were approximately $125,976,000. </P>
<B><P>Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</P>
<I><P>Basis of consolidation</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. </P>
<B><I><P>Use of estimates</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. </P>
<B><I><P>Fair value of financial instruments</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The carrying amounts of certain of the Company's
financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable
approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates
currently available to the Company for leases with similar terms, the carrying
value of its lease obligations approximates fair value. </P>
<B><I><P>Cash and cash equivalents</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates market value. The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. The Company invests primarily in money market funds and
commercial paper, accordingly, these investments are subject to minimal credit
and market risks. </P>
<B><I><P>Restricted cash</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Restricted cash as of December 31, 2001 is primarily
comprised of $723,000 for security on customer credit card transactions, on
leases of administrative offices and others. Restricted cash as of December 31,
2000 is primarily comprised of $15,453,000 held in escrow for deposits on future
advertising (Note 5) and $533,000 for security on customer credit card
transactions, on lease of administrative offices and others. </P>

<B><I><P>Short- and long-term marketable securities</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Marketable securities are classified as available-
for-sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 115, "<I>Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Securities</I>" and
are carried at fair value. Marketable securities classified as current assets
have scheduled maturities of less than one year, while marketable securities
classified as non-current assets have scheduled maturities of more than one
year. Unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities are included in
accumulated comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders' equity (deficit).
Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in
earnings and computed using the specific identification cost method. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were $226,000 and $73,000 in unrealized gains as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, included in the comprehensive income
in stockholders' equity (deficit). </P>

</PRE>
<B><I><P>Certain risks and uncertainties</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company's operating results depend to a
significant extent on the Company's ability to market and develop its products.
The life cycles of the Company's products are difficult to estimate due in part
to the effect of future product enhancements and competition. The inability of
the Company to successfully develop and market its products as a result of
competition or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. The Company invests excess cash primarily in money market funds of
major financial institutions, commercial paper and notes. The Company provides
credit to customers in the normal course of business. Collateral is not required
for accounts receivable, but ongoing credit evaluations of customers' financial
condition are performed. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit
losses and such losses have been within management's expectations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the United States of America, the Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA") regulates the design, manufacture, distribution,
preclinical and clinical study, clearance and approval of medical devices.
Products developed by the Company may require approvals or clearances from the
FDA or other international regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales.
There can be no assurance that the Company's products will receive any of the
required approvals or clearances. If the Company was denied approval or
clearance or such approval was delayed, it may have a material adverse impact on
the Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has manufacturing operations located outside the
United States of America. The Company currently relies on its manufacturing
facilities in Pakistan to create virtual treatment plans with the assistance of
sophisticated software.</FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>The Company is in the process of
establishing facilities in other locations that are redundant to Pakistan's
operations. In addition, the Company relies on third party manufacturers in
Mexico to fabricate Aligners and to ship the completed product to the Company's
customers. The Company's reliance on international operations exposes it to
related risks and uncertainties, including; difficulties in staffing and
managing international operations; controlling quality of manufacture;
political, social and economic instability; interruptions and limitations in
telecommunication services; product and/or material transportation delays or
disruption; trade restrictions and changes in tariffs; import and export license
requirements and restrictions; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and
potential adverse tax consequences. If any of these risks materialize, the
Company's international manufacturing operations, as well as its operating
results, may be harmed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company receives certain of its components from sole
suppliers. Additionally, the Company relies on a limited number of hardware
manufacturers. The inability of any supplier or manufacturer to fulfill supply
requirements of the Company could materially impact future operating results.
</P>
<B><I><P>Inventories</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. </P>
<B><I><P>Property and equipment</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Property and equipment are stated at historical cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization
are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which are: 3 years for computer software and hardware and 5 years
for plant equipment, furniture, fixtures and equipment. Amortization of
leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, or the remaining lease term, whichever is
shorter. Upon sale or retirement, the asset's cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is
reflected in operations. </P>
<B><I><P>Development costs for internal use software and web-site
development</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company accounts for development costs for
internal used software in accordance with the AICPA Statement of Position 98-
1<I>, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use</I>" (&quot;SOP 98-1&quot;). The Company has also adopted Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-2 <I>"Accounting for the Costs of Developing a
Web Site</I>". </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Web site development and related costs consist of external
and internal costs incurred to purchase and implement the web site software and
significant enhancements used in the Company's business. Costs incurred in the
development of application and infrastructure of the web site are capitalized
and amortized over the useful life of the web site. Web site development costs
of $495,000 and $397,000 had been capitalized as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Amortization of web site development costs commenced in July 2000
upon launch of the web site. Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2001
and 2000 amounted to $201,000 and $66,000, respectively. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Internal and external costs of designing, creating and
maintaining web site content, graphics and user interface on the web site are
expensed as incurred and included in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Operations in accordance with SOP 98-1. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was other software developed for internal use and
capitalized as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 in the amount of $544,000 and
$111,000, respectively. Amortization of the $111,000 began in January 2001 and
amounted to $37,000 as of December 31, 2001. Amortization has not started on the
additional $433,000 of capitalized costs as the software is not in use as of
December 31, 2001. </P>
<B><I><P>Impairment of long-lived assets</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company identifies and records impairment losses
on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate
that the assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets.
Recoverability is measured by comparison of the assets carrying amount to future
net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets
are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by
the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected
discounted future net cash flows arising from the asset. </P>
<B><I><P>Revenue recognition</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has adopted the provisions of Staff
Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101<I> "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements</I>" and believes that its current revenue recognition is in
compliance with the SAB. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Revenue from the Invisalign product and Ancillary product
sales are recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and product shipment
provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is
deemed probable. Up-front fees received in connection with the Invisalign
product are deferred and recognized over the associated product shipments. The
costs of producing the ClinCheck treatment plan, which are incurred prior to the
production of Aligners, are capitalized and recognized as related revenues are
earned. Ancillary product sales consist primarily of dental impression machines.
The Company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products in
accordance with SFAS No. 5, "<I>Accounting for Contingencies</I>." Actual
warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued. The
Company's warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered
defective or fail to meet the product specifications. Provisions for discounts
and rebates to customers, are provided for in the same period that the related
product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates.</P>
</FONT><p>Service revenues which are earned under agreements with third
parties for training of dental professionals and staff for Invisalign are
recorded as the related expenses are incurred.  Charges to third parties are
based on negotiated rates which are intended to approximate the Company's
anticipated costs.</p>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company estimates its loss on the sale, and
records a provision for the entire amount of estimated loss in the period such
losses are determined. Accrued loss is set off against deferred costs in all
those cases that are not in a net loss position. The sales recorded by the
Company through September 30, 2000 had significant losses, the sales recorded by
the Company between October 2000 and December 2001 have not had any significant
losses. </P>
<B><I><P>Research and development</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. </P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advertising costs </P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. For
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 advertising costs totaled
$17,466,000, $20,804,000 and $1,722,000, respectively. </P>
<B><I><P>Foreign currency</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company uses the U.S. dollar as its functional
currency. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S.
dollars at current exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are generally
translated at average exchange rates in effect during each period. Gains or
losses from foreign currency re-measurement are included in consolidated net
earnings. </P>
<B><I><P>Income taxes</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Income taxes are recorded under the liability method,
under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are
established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized. </P>
<B><I><P>Accounting for stock-based compensation</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, "<I>Accounting for Stock Issued to Empl</I>oyees" ("APB
25") and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, "<I>Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation</I>"
("SFAS 123"). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under APB 25, compensation expense for grants to employees is
based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair
value of the Company's stock and the option's exercise price. SFAS 123 defines a
"fair value" based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar
equity investment. The pro forma disclosure of the difference between
compensation expense included in net loss and the related cost measured by the
fair value method is presented in Note 8. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company also adopted FASB issued Interpretation No. 44,
("FIN 44"), "<I>Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation--an Interpretation of APB 25</I>." </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-
employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 and Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 96-18<I>, "Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to
Other Than Employees, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods and Services</I>,"
and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28, "<I>Accounting
for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plan</I>"
("FIN 28"). </P>
<B><I><P>Segments</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company reports segment data based on the
management approach which designates the internal reporting that is used by
management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the
source of the Company's reportable operating segments. During all periods
presented, the Company operated in a single business segment. No single foreign
country accounted for 10% or more of assets or 10% or more of revenues in fiscal
2001, 2000 and 1999.</P>
<B><I><P>Net loss per share</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basic and diluted net loss per share are computed by
dividing the net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period,
less the weighted average number of shares of common stock that are subject to
repurchase. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential
common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. Potential common stock consists
of common stock subject to repurchase, incremental common shares issuable upon
the exercise of stock options and warrants and shares issuable upon conversion
of the preferred stock. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following is a reconciliation of the numerator (net loss
available to common stockholders) and the denominator (number of shares) used in
the basic and diluted Earnings per Share ("EPS") calculations (in thousands,

<B><I><P>Recent accounting pronouncements</P>
</B></I><P>In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(&quot;FASB&quot;) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141
(&quot;SFAS 141&quot;), <I>&quot;Business Combinations,&quot;</I> which
establishes financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and
supersedes APB Opinion No. 16, <I>Business Combinations,</I> and FASB Statement
No. 38, <I>Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased
Enterprises</I>. It requires that all business combinations in the scope of this
Statement are to be accounted for using one method, the purchase method. The
provisions of this Statement apply to all business combinations initiated after
September 30, 2001, and also applies to all business combinations accounted for
using the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001, or
later. To date, the Company has not engaged in a business combination.</P>
<P>In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
142 (&quot;SFAS 142&quot;), <I>"Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets</I>,<I>"</I> which establishes financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17,
<I>Intangible Assets.  </I>It addresses how intangible assets that are acquired
individually or with a group of other assets (but not those acquired in a
business combination) should be accounted for in financial statements upon their
acquisition, and after they have been initially recognized in the financial
statements. The provisions of this Statement are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001.  The Company will adopt SFAS 142 during
fiscal year 2002.  To date, the Company has not recorded goodwill or other
intangible assets.    </P>
<P>In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "<I>Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-
Lived Assets</I>," which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2001 and interim periods within those fiscal periods. This Statement
supersedes FASB Statement No. 121 and APB 30, however, this Statement retains
the requirement of Opinion 30 to report discontinued operations separately from
continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity
that either has been disposed of (by sale, by abandonment, or in a distribution
to owners) or is classified as held for sale. This Statement addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long-lived assets and for
long-lived assets to be disposed of.  Management does not expect the adoption of
SFAS 144 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position and
results of operations.</P>
<P>In May 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued EITF Issue No. 00-
14<I>, &quot;Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives</I>.&quot; EITF Issue No.
00-14 addresses the recognition, measurement, and income statement
classification for sales incentives that a vendor voluntarily offers to
customers (without charge), which the customer can use in, or exercise as a
result of, a single exchange transaction. Sales incentives that fall within the
scope of EITF Issue No. 00-14 include offers that a customer can use to receive
a reduction in the price of a product or service at the point of sale. The EITF
agreed to change the transition date for Issue 00-14, dictating that a company
should apply this consensus no later than the Company's annual or interim
financial statements for the periods beginning after December 15, 2001. In June
2001, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 00-25, <I>&quot;Vendor Income Statement
Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's
Products</I>,&quot; effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2001.
EITF Issue No. 00-25 addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller
is an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor's products and, therefore,
should be deducted from revenue when recognized in the vendor's statement of
operations or a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from
the reseller and, therefore, should be included as a cost or expense when
recognized in the vendor's statement of operations. Upon application of these
EITFs, financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes
should be reclassified to comply with the income statement display requirements
under these Issues. In September of 2001, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 01-09,
<I>&quot;Accounting for Consideration Given by Vendor to a Customer or a
Reseller of the Vendor's Products</I>&quot;, which is a codification of EITF
Issues No. 00-14, No. 00-25 and No. 00-22 &quot;<I>Accounting for `Points' and
Certain Other Time- or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers and Offers for Free
Products or Services to be Delivered in the Future</I>.&quot; The Company is
currently assessing the impact of the adoption of these issues on our financial
statements. </P>

vehicles to all salespeople. The lease term is for 3 years, commencing upon
acceptance of delivery. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June 2000, the Company entered into a non-cancelable
operating lease to lease a manufacturing facility in Santa Clara, California.
The lease term is for five years, commencing July 1, 2000. The Company paid
$1,175,000 security deposit upon execution of the lease. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In July 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to
sublease additional office space in Santa Clara, California. The lease term
began on July 14, 2000 and expires on August 14, 2002. A security deposit of
$184,448 was paid by the Company upon execution of the lease. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In August 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to
sublease additional office space in Santa Clara, California. The lease term

for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The terms of
the facility lease provide for rental payments on a graduated scale. The Company
recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period, and has
accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future minimum lease payments under operating leases as
of December 31, 2001 are $3,103,000, $2,223,000, $2,185,000, $1,090,000, and

television and radio media time on behalf of the Company. In consideration of
the services provided by TBWA, the Company has agreed to deposit a certain
amount with the Escrow Agent for purposes of repaying TBWA. The Company's total
commitment will not at any time exceed the total amount held in escrow. At
December 31, 2000, the Company had $15,453,000 held in money market funds with
the Escrow Agent. This amount has been classified as restricted cash. The
Company has subsequently used the funds and there are no advertising commitment
escrow funds remaining in the escrow account as of December 31, 2001.</P>
<B><I><P>Contingencies</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company was involved in a patent infringement
proceeding with a plaintiff asserting infringement of two of its patents. On
June 30, 2000, the Company entered into a stipulation of dismissal with the
plaintiff whereby the plaintiff agreed not to recommence a suit against the
Company for two years with respect to the disputed patents. Pursuant to the
agreement, if a patent is subsequently issued to the plaintiff and the plaintiff
believes the Company is infringing it, then the plaintiff may commence suit
after one year from the effective date of the agreement and include in such
action claims involving the two previously disputed patents. If any such action
is successful, it could result in a significant monetary damages judgment
against the Company. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In February 2001 Align Technology was named in a class action
lawsuit filed on behalf of all licensed dentists (excluding orthodontists) in
the U.S. The complaint alleged that Align Technology's policy of selling
Invisalign exclusively to orthodontists violated the U.S. antitrust laws.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, the company entered into a Stipulation and
Agreement of Settlement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The total
legal and other settlement costs that Align has agreed to pay are approximately
$400,000. Pursuant to the settlement, Align will undertake to train and certify
5,000 general practice dentists each year over the next four years. In November
2001, the Court approved the Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement.</P>

<B><I><FONT SIZE=2><P>Sale of preferred securities</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In May, June and October 2000, the Company sold
9,535,052 shares of Series D preferred shares for gross proceeds of
$101,272,000. Included in the 9,535,052 total shares issued, the Company issued
1,321,202 Series D shares upon the conversion of the Convertible Subordinated
Promissory Notes financing (the "Notes") and associated interest as discussed
below. The issuance of Series D convertible preferred stock resulted in a
beneficial conversion feature, calculated in accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 98-5, "<I>Accounting for Convertible Securities with
Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios</I>"
(&quot;EITF 98-5&quot;). Accordingly, the Company has recognized $47,564,000 as
a charge to additional paid in capital to account for the deemed dividend on the
preferred stock as of the issuance as of December 31, 2000. As noted, the Series
D preferred shares have certain contingent rights and preferences that were
perfected and caused the Company to record an incremental beneficial conversion
feature charge. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has accounted for a beneficial conversion feature
embedded in convertible subordinated notes (the "Notes") entered into on May 15,
2000. The beneficial conversion feature, amounting to $7,689,000, represents an
additional interest yield on the debt which may be converted at any time at the
option of the holders into immediately convertible preferred stock. Accordingly,
the beneficial conversion feature has been recorded as an immediate charge to
interest expense in May 2000. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the Notes
and associated accrued interest were converted into the Company's convertible

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 9,535,052 shares of Series D preferred stock that the
Company issued in 2000 were subject to an antidilution conversion price
adjustment feature which the Company triggered when it granted options to
purchase its common stock beyond the number of options that were authorized
under its 1997 Plan at the time the Company commenced its Series D preferred
stock offering in May 2000. The conversion feature provided that if, during the
period between May 12, 2000 (the commitment date for the Company's Series D
preferred stock offering) and the earlier of the closing of an initial public
offering or January 31, 2001, the Company had granted more than an aggregate of
3,331,978 options to purchase its common stock, then the conversion price of the
Company's Series D preferred stock would be adjusted downward from its original
conversion price of $10.625 per share.  As of December 31, 2000, the Company had
granted 1,257,614 options to purchase shares of its common stock in excess of
the 3,331,978 options permitted, and were therefore required to issue an
additional 419,700 shares of common stock upon the conversion of the Series D
preferred stock. The additional shares to be issued upon conversion of the
Series D preferred stock resulted in a beneficial conversion feature, calculated
in accordance with EITF 98-5. As of December 31, 2000, the Company recognized an
incremental deemed dividend based on the fair value of the common stock at the
commitment date of the Series D preferred stock offering of $5,952,000 related
to the preferred stock sold and a charge to interest expense of $959,000 for the
beneficial conversion feature embedded in the convertible subordinated notes

</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During fiscal 2001 and 2000, the Company accelerated
the vesting of options to several employees in connection with a severance
package. The acceleration was accounted for in accordance with FIN 44 as a one
time charge of $224,000 and $429,000, respectively, to the statement of
operations. The charge was equal to the intrinsic value difference between the
exercise price of the accelerated options and the fair value of the common stock
on the date of acceleration. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of
favorable tax attributes in future tax returns, the Company has placed a
valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax assets. At such time as
it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets
are realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced. The valuation allowance
increased $29,987,000, $25,254,000 and $5,345,000 during 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At December 31, 2001, the Company had federal and state net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $155,950,000 and $156,560,000,
respectively, available to offset future regular and alternative minimum taxable
income. The Company's federal and state net operating loss carry forwards will
begin to expire in 2017 for federal purposes and 2005 for state purposes if not
utilized. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At December 31, 2001, the Company had federal and state
research and experimentation tax credit carry forwards of approximately
$2,144,000 and $983,000, respectively, available to offset future income tax
liabilities. The Company's federal research and experimentation credit will
begin to expire in 2017. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limits the use of net operating
loss and tax credit carry forwards in certain situations where changes occur in
the stock ownership of a Company. If the Company should have an ownership
change, as defined by the tax law, utilization of the carry forwards could be
restricted. </P>
