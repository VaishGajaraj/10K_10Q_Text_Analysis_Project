to treat diseases other than those described above. All of our development timelines could be subject to adjustment depending on recruitment rate, regulatory agency review, and other factors that could delay the initiation and completion of clinical
trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aldehydes are pro-inflammatory, and we believe that aldehyde traps may represent a novel and important approach to treating
diseases characterized by inflammation. Allergic conjunctivitis is a common ocular inflammatory disease that affects more than 20% of the population worldwide. The disease is thought to be mediated in part by pro-inflammatory aldehydes that
exacerbate inflammation of the conjunctiva, resulting in ocular itching, excessive tear production, swelling, and redness. Other ophthalmic allergic diseases include atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), a rare condition characterized by persistent
inflammation of the front of the eye. In contrast to allergic inflammation, noninfectious anterior uveitis is a painful and severe autoimmune inflammatory disease of the eye that can lead to blindness. A portion of allergic conjunctivitis patients,
many AKC patients, and most noninfectious anterior uveitis patients are treated with topical corticosteroids, a class of medication that over time leads to ocular toxicity, including cataract (ocular lens opacities resulting in vision impairment)
formation, glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure that can, in some cases, lead to blindness), corneal ulcers, and increased rates of ocular infections. We believe that novel anti-inflammatory medications are needed to improve symptoms and deter
disease progression, especially in order to reduce dependence on topical corticosteroids. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Patients with inborn errors of metabolism due
to genetic mutations in aldehyde-metabolizing enzymes endogenously generate elevated levels of aldehydes, which are directly toxic or lead to the formation of toxic aldehyde derivatives. By reducing aldehyde load, we believe that aldehyde traps have
the potential to at least partially mitigate the pathology associated with inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) is a rare condition that we believe afflicts approximately 1,000 patients in the United States. The
disease is caused by mutations in fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that metabolizes fatty (generally 16-18 carbon) aldehydes, resulting in high levels of toxic aldehydes that are the suspected cause of ichthyosis (a severe skin disease),
mental delay, spasticity, and, in some patients, retinal dysfunction. The symptoms of SLS patients are poorly treated, and no therapy specifically indicated for SLS has been approved by the FDA. Succinic Semi-Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (SSADH)
Deficiency is a rare inborn error of aldehyde metabolism that has been identified in over 400 patients worldwide, and is caused by genetic mutations in SSADH, leading to elevated aldehyde levels. High aldehyde load in SSADH deficiency is thought to
cause severe neurologic dysfunction, including autism, motor disorders, cognitive delay and seizures. The symptoms of SSADH Deficiency patients are poorly treated, and no therapy specifically indicated for SSADH Deficiency has been approved by the
FDA. Given the lack of efficacious therapy, we believe that novel medications are needed to improve symptoms and deter disease progression for inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Occurring generally as a result of a large number of metabolic processes, aldehydes are an endogenously generated chemical species that, among
other things, promote inflammation. At high levels, aldehydes are toxic and are implicated as mediators of many inflammatory diseases. Other diseases thought to be related to aldehydes include inborn errors of metabolism, where genetic mutations
lead to the incapacity to metabolize certain toxic aldehydes. We believe that the medical needs of the patients suffering from aldehyde-mediated diseases are not currently well addressed and that there is a large market potential for therapies that
can lower aldehyde levels. In particular, current therapies for inflammatory diseases often lead to toxicity, and there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically indicated for inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2015, we initiated a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase IIa clinical trial of NS2 ophthalmic
solution in patients with allergic conjunctivitis, an ocular inflammatory disease. In February 2016, we announced topline results for this trial, which demonstrated statistically significant activity of NS2 over vehicle in reducing ocular itching
and tearing. We believe that this trial is the first demonstration of the clinical efficacy of aldehyde trapping in any human disease. In April 2015, we initiated a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase II clinical
trial of NS2 ophthalmic solution in patients with noninfectious anterior uveitis, an ocular inflammatory disease. Data from this trial are expected in the second quarter of 2016. In March 2015, we initiated a randomized, parallel-group,
double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase II clinical trial of a dermatologic formulation of NS2 for the treatment of the skin manifestations of SLS, an inborn error of aldehyde metabolism. Data from this trial are expected in the second or third
quarter of 2016. We may initiate clinical trials with NS2 in other diseases thought to be mediated in part by aldehydes, and we have commenced development of a systemic formulation of NS2, which we expect to initiate Phase I clinical testing by the
end of 2016 in preparation for potential Phase II clinical trials in inborn errors of metabolism and severe inflammatory crises. We are also developing aldehyde traps different from NS2 that have the potential to treat diseases other than those
described above. For mass-market diseases, we may partner with larger companies for development and commercialization. All of our development timelines could be subject to adjustment depending on recruitment rate, regulatory agency review, and other
factors that could delay the initiation and completion of clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Allergic Conjunctivitis </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Allergic conjunctivitis is a common allergic disease that is thought to be mediated in part by pro-inflammatory aldehydes, and is characterized
by inflammation of the conjunctiva, resulting in excessive ocular itching and tear production in addition to ocular swelling and redness. Allergic conjunctivitis has been estimated to affect more than 20% of the population worldwide. The mainstay of
therapy for allergic conjunctivitis is anti-histamines, which may lead to mydriasis (large pupils) and, in some patients, blurry vision. Further, a significant number of patients do not respond to anti-histamines, especially after the acute effects
of the medication subside. Many anti-histamine-recalcitrant patients are prescribed corticosteroids and other more potent drugs that may lead to a variety of ocular toxicities. Other ocular diseases related to allergic conjunctivitis include atopic
keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), which is a rare condition characterized by persistent allergic inflammation of the front of the eye. Treatment of AKC generally requires chronic corticosteroid administration, which often results in ocular toxicity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By trapping pro-inflammatory aldehydes, we believe NS2 may reduce inflammation in allergic conjunctivitis, AKC, and related diseases. NS2 may
also reduce the burden of corticosteroid use in patients with persistent disease or in patients that do not respond adequately to anti-histamines. Because corticosteroids exacerbate the formation of cataracts and glaucoma and may increase ocular
infection and corneal ulceration, we believe that there is a high demand for a novel topical anti-inflammatory agent to be used in conjunction with, or in place of, corticosteroids. </P>

rapid-onset pain, sensitivity to light, and loss of vision that can progress to blindness. The disease may occur with other autoimmune diseases. The annual incidence of noninfectious anterior uveitis in the United States is estimated to be 25,000
patients, and approximately one-third of these patients have one or more episodes per year. Patients with recurrent episodes often develop cataracts, and severe cases may lead to glaucoma, retinal dysfunction, or blindness. The disease is typically
treated with topical corticosteroids, though prolonged used of corticosteroids increases the incidence of cataracts and glaucoma in uveitis. Corticosteroids may also increase the incidence of infection and corneal ulceration. Even with
corticosteroid therapy, it has been estimated that uveitis is responsible for 10% of the blindness in the United States. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By trapping

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) is caused by a variety of mutations of an enzyme called fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), leading to
the accumulation of fatty aldehydes or precursor molecules that are generally 16 to 18 carbons in length. The aldehyde accumulation is thought to result in the pathology of the disease, which includes a severe skin disorder called ichthyosis, as
well as mental delay, spasticity, and, in some patients, retinal disorders. While FALDH dysfunction also leads to diminished levels of certain fatty acids, therapy with these fatty acids has been ineffective in SLS patients. SLS patients are
generally diagnosed as neonates given the severe ichthyosis that presents at birth. The disease persists lifelong, and SLS patients have a shortened lifespan, often dying in the sixth decade of life. Some SLS patients are believed to inherit the
disease, though most occurrences of SLS appear to be due to sporadic mutations. The disease occurs worldwide. To our knowledge, Sweden is currently the only country to have estimated the prevalence of the disease, at 1&nbsp;per 250,000 people.
Extrapolating from the Swedish estimate, it is generally assumed that there are approximately 1,000 or fewer SLS patients in the United States and a larger number in Europe. The United States SLS prevalence estimate is supported by frequency
analysis of FALDH missense mutations in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute exome sequencing database. We believe that many older SLS patients may be undiagnosed, potentially due to the lack of available dermatologic and genetic medicine
expertise available when those patients were younger. There is no FDA-approved treatment specifically indicated for SLS. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The primary
day-to-day complaint of SLS patients and their caregivers is ichthyosis, a severe skin disease characterized in SLS patients by thick, scaly, dry, wrinkled, pigmented, pruritic (itchy), inflamed skin. SLS patients are consistently disturbed by
pruritus and often excoriate skin by scratching. The ichthyosis in SLS affects most of the body, generally sparing the face, palms, and soles. There is currently no specific therapy approved for the treatment of the dermatologic disease in SLS,
though some patients and their caregivers apply non-specific topical creams, including keratinolytics (acids that soften skin), moisturizers, and retinoids. We believe that the effects of keratinolytic and moisturizing creams are minimal or
non-existent in treating severe ichthyosis, and due to toxicity, retinoids are not suitable for chronic use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The dermatologic disease in
SLS is thought to be caused by aldehyde-mediated modification of lipids (fats) that are generated in the epidermis (the most superficial layer of skin) to form a moisture barrier that holds water in the skin. Moisture barrier compromise leads to
water loss, which in turn leads to dermal thickening characteristic of ichthyosis. We believe that by lowering levels of aldehydes and thereby preventing lipid modification and the ensuing moisture barrier dysfunction, NS2, when applied topically to
the skin, has the potential to ameliorate the dermatologic symptoms of SLS and deter disease progression. Further, by reducing aldehyde load throughout the body, we believe the systemic administration of NS2 or other aldehyde traps may be beneficial
in the treatment of the neurological and ocular symptoms of SLS. </P>

of succinic semi-aldehyde, a toxic aldehyde that is converted into gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and other metabolites that lead to severe neurological dysfunction, including cognitive delay, seizures, and motor disease. Over 400 patients with SSADH
deficiency have been identified worldwide, though the precise prevalence of the disease is not known. GHB (also known as sodium oxybate, a drug marketed for psychiatric disorders) and possibly other succinic semi-aldehyde metabolites lead to
depression of neurological function, and some patients with a diagnosis of autism have been found to have SSADH Deficiency. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is

medication is currently undergoing testing in a clinical trial run by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to our knowledge, none have shown promise in addressing the core toxicity of succinic semi-aldehyde, and patients are
generally poorly treated. By trapping succinic semi-aldehyde, NS2 or other systemically administered aldehyde traps may have the potential to reduce the direct toxicity of succinic semi-aldehyde as well as the formation of neurotoxic metabolites,
and represent a novel approach with considerable therapeutic potential in a disease where there remains significant unmet medical need. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>A New

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aldehydes are generated through a variety of metabolic processes and are pro-inflammatory. At high levels, aldehydes are toxic, binding
proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and DNA, and may mediate inflammation in, and the progression of, many serious diseases through signaling cascades that lead to the activation of intracellular inflammatory factors, including <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">NF-kB,</FONT> an important protein in the inflammatory response. In addition, aldehyde binding to cellular constituents leads to the formation of indigestible adducts and aggregates that are pro-inflammatory and may lead
to cellular dysfunction. Because of the inherent toxicity of aldehydes, most, if not all, living organisms contain enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenases that detoxify aldehydes. The toxicity of aldehydes is evidenced by human studies showing an
increased rate of cognitive decline, cancer, and cardiovascular disease in populations with diminished aldehyde dehydrogenase capacity. Additionally, most inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and
cardiovascular diseases, manifest elevated aldehyde levels that apparently overwhelm endogenous aldehyde catabolic capacity. To our knowledge, there has never been a concerted pharmaceutical effort to lower all aldehyde levels. Thus, we believe that
trapping aldehydes represents a novel platform for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism where genetic mutations prevent the normal degradation of aldehydes. </P>

currently developing NS2, a new chemical entity, for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. NS2 is a small molecule designed specifically to trap, and thereby allow for the degradation of, aldehydes. In<I>
in vitro</I> and animal studies, NS2 appears to have minimal pharmacology, meaning that NS2 does not appear to affect most cellular components, including most receptors, enzymes, ion channels, or other proteins. NS2 has been shown to bind and trap
aldehydes more rapidly than aldehydes bind any cellular constituent. Evidence suggests that NS2 covalently binds to aldehydes to form NS2-aldehyde adducts, which are rapidly transported to cellular lysosomes and degraded within hours. Outside the
lysosome, the NS2-aldehyde adduct is remarkably non-reactive and stable, meaning that NS2-aldehyde binding is essentially irreversible<I> in vivo</I>, hence the notion of NS2 as an aldehyde trap. By essentially irreversibly binding aldehydes to form
covalent adducts that are transported to lysosomes for degradation, NS2 has the potential to substantially lower aldehyde levels. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to assess the efficacy of aldehyde trapping in human disease, in 2015 we initiated a
series of clinical trials in patients with ocular inflammatory disease and in patients with SLS, an inborn error of aldehyde metabolism. Our initial clinical trials in inflammation involved ocular testing, in part, due to the ability to
non-invasively assess inflammation on the surface of and within the eye and the ability to treat the eye with topical administration of drug. Our initial clinical trial in inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism focused on SLS, in part, because the
dermatologic aspects of the disease may respond to topical administration of drug, and assessment of dermatological response can be performed with relatively non-invasive techniques and clinical examination. Most inflammatory diseases and, that we
are aware, all inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism, involve at least some tissues that cannot be effectively treated topically, and thus we are developing systemic formulations of aldehyde traps, including NS2, and plan to initiate Phase I clinical
testing of a systemic formulation by the end of 2016. Potential indications for systemic aldehyde traps include: SLS and SSADH Deficiency, two inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism; and severe inflammatory crises where systemic corticosteroids or
other potentially toxic anti-inflammatory drugs are currently used in acute care settings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2015, we initiated a randomized,
parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase IIa clinical trial of NS2 ophthalmic solution in patients with allergic conjunctivitis. Using the conjunctival allergen provocation test (CAPT), one hundred healthy men and women with at least
a two-year history of allergic conjunctivitis to grass, tree or ragweed pollen were randomized in equal groups for treatment with topical ocular NS2 or vehicle, and ocular inflammation was induced by exposure to allergen. The clinical endpoints in
the trial included patient assessment (on a 0 to 4 point scale) of ocular itching and tearing, two prominent inflammation-related symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. In February 2016, we announced topline results, which demonstrated statistically
significant activity of NS2 over vehicle in reducing ocular itching and tearing, as shown in the graphics below, which, relative to baseline and relative to vehicle, indicate the efficacy of NS2 immediately after initiation of therapy (Visit 4) and
after 14 days of dosing (Visit 5). Relative to baseline scores, NS2 demonstrated durable efficacy that persisted across substantially all time points over three hours following CAPT challenges. Despite a stronger than expected vehicle effect, peak
changes in ocular itching and tearing scores were statistically superior to vehicle. The reductions from baseline scores were of the same magnitude previously observed in the CAPT model with existing therapies utilized in the treatment of allergic
conjunctivitis, and peak changes exceeded one point for both ocular itching and tearing scores. Both drug and vehicle reduced ocular redness relative to baseline, but there were no differences in redness reduction between drug and vehicle groups.
NS2 was generally well tolerated and there were no safety concerns during the trial. Transient and generally mild stinging was noted in the treatment arm. Two patients dropped out of the trial during treatment. </P>

ophthalmic solution in patients with noninfectious anterior uveitis, another ocular inflammatory disease. Data from this trial are expected in the second quarter of 2016. To assess the activity of NS2 in inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism, we
initiated in March 2015 a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase II clinical trial of a dermatologic formulation of NS2 for the treatment of the skin manifestations of SLS. Data from this trial are expected in the second
or third quarter of 2016. Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of the Phase II clinical trials with topical administration of NS2. The clinical designs of the trials in Table 1 have been posted on www.clinicaltrials.gov. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Thus, we believe that aldehyde trapping with NS2 potentially has a variety of mechanisms of action &#150; lowering inflammation, reducing
healing time, diminishing scarring, and protecting a lipid important in tissue moisture barriers &#150; that may ameliorate aldehyde-mediated disease and deter aldehyde-mediated disease progression in different ways at the same time. </P>

increasing levels of inflammation, there is no generally accepted role of high levels of aldehydes. Some physiologic molecules have aldehyde forms, including retinaldehyde (a form of Vitamin A) and pyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate (forms of Vitamin
B6), but these molecules are not free aldehydes in that they are tightly chaperoned and protected by proteins that prevent the aldehydes from reacting with other molecules, including aldehyde traps. Thus, aldehyde trapping is expected<I> a
priori</I> not to lead to overt toxicity by sequestering physiologic aldehydes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have completed one Phase IIa clinical trial, one Phase
II clinical trial and a number of non-clinical and preclinical toxicity studies of NS2, which appears to be generally well tolerated and safe. Based on the evidence collected by us to date, NS2 is an aldehyde trap that has minimal pharmacological
activity per se, in that there are no known direct interactions with cellular components that appear to have significant effects in animals. After systemic exposure to high levels of NS2, no signs of retinaldehyde deficiency on retinal function have
been observed, nor have we observed any effects in animals that would suggest pyridoxal deficiencies. No significant toxicity has been observed by us in an animal model when NS2 was administered as a 0.5% eye drop four times per day for up to nine
months. No consistent toxicity was observed in animals topically treated once-daily with a 1% NS2 dermatologic formulation for 9 weeks. No NS2-related toxicity has been observed in animals when NS2 was systemically administered in special
cardiovascular, neurobehavioral and pulmonary safety studies, or in other studies with NS2, either acutely or chronically, including a study where animals were administered NS2 intravenously for 60 days. In preparation for clinical testing of
systemically administered NS2, other intravenous toxicology studies are in progress. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To our knowledge, levels of aldehydes in tissue
generally do not exceed 10&micro;M for sustained durations, since, based on cell toxicity studies after exposure to aldehydes, 10&micro;M concentrations can lead to significant cell death. In skin cell culture from patients with SLS, over 80% cell
death has been observed at 60&micro;M concentrations of aldehydes; however, biopsies of SLS patients do not indicate cell death, suggesting that the actual aldehyde concentrations in the skin of SLS patients is far lower than 60&micro;M. In the
tears of patients with dry eye, aldehyde concentrations are estimated at 1&micro;M. Based on the totality of these results, we believe that the levels of aldehydes in SLS or other human diseases are likely significantly lower than 10&micro;M on a
sustained basis. Relative to aldehyde levels, concentrations of NS2 are generally higher in our pharmaceutical preparations and in the tissue of animals after NS2 administration. Eye drops containing 0.5% NS2 are greater than 20mM (20,000-fold
greater than reported aldehyde load in tears of dry eye patients), and a single drop results in maximum anterior ocular tissue concentrations of greater than 15&micro;M in non-human primates. Likewise, maximum NS2 concentrations in 1% dermatologic
topical preparations are greater than 40mM, and following 21 days of once-daily exposure to topical 1% NS2 in animals, dermal tissue levels of NS2 ranged from 10 to 30 &micro;M, with systemic levels of NS2 estimated to be less than 1 &micro;M. Given
the potential to be able to administer NS2 topically in concentrations that far exceed predicted aldehyde concentrations, we believe that NS2 has the potential to significantly lower aldehyde loads in diseases where topical administration of NS2 is
applicable. However, it is likely that there are &#147;sinks&#148; or stores of aldehydes that are temporarily bound to proteins and other cellular and non-cellular constituents. Temporarily bound aldehydes are likely not immediately accessible to
aldehyde traps. Over time, as accessible aldehydes are trapped, aldehyde sinks may release free aldehyde, requiring sustained administration of aldehyde traps to lower total aldehyde levels. </P>

equilibrium such that at any point in time, the aldehyde substrate may be bound or unbound. In this way, Schiff base reactions alone represent reversible and temporary aldehyde binding. Various aldehyde-binding amines have been described,
particularly carnosine (a naturally occurring dipeptide), which has a variety of additional potential mechanisms of action unrelated to aldehydes. At least one group has published on the use of certain nitrogen-containing marketed products to
temporarily, in a reversible manner, bind retinaldehyde as a potential therapy for retinal disease. We believe that NS2 and other novel aldehyde traps that we have discovered are differentiated from the above approaches in that the chemical
structures are novel and the reaction with aldehydes is essentially irreversible<I> in vivo</I>, which we believe may result in a more effective means of diminishing aldehyde levels. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At least one company (Aldea Pharmaceuticals) has developed catalysts of aldehyde dehydrogenases in order to facilitate the catabolism of
certain aldehydes. Initial applications of this approach appear to include reducing levels of acetaldehyde, a product of ethanol consumption. While we believe that NS2 and other aldehyde traps may also diminish acetaldehyde levels, we do not, in the
near future, intend to pursue acetaldehyde reduction following ethanol consumption as a commercial opportunity. We do not believe that catalysis of specific aldehyde dehydrogenases would be likely to benefit disorders where aldehyde dehydrogenase
activity is missing due to genetic mutations. Further, we are not aware that any aldehyde dehydrogenase catalyst manifests anti-inflammatory activity. </P>

proven to be safe and effective, we believe that NS2 could be used in place of or in addition to current therapies, especially in instances where current therapies are toxic and reducing exposure to such therapies would be desirable. Topical
corticosteroids for ocular inflammatory diseases are often associated with toxicity, including corneal ulceration, cataracts, and glaucoma. There is no approved therapy for SLS. We believe that the current non-specific creams and medications for SLS
are poorly effective, if effective at all. There is no approved therapy for SSADH Deficiency. We believe that anti-epileptics and other medications used in SSADH Deficiency are inadequate in controlling the symptoms of the disease. While NS2 and
other novel aldehyde traps may manifest efficacy and safety advantages over currently available therapies, many such therapies are generic or may be priced considerably lower than the NS2 pricing that we anticipate. Pricing factors may discourage
the initial or prolonged use of NS2. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many drugs are in development for allergic conjunctivitis. Novartis/Alcon (ESBA105, LME636) and

from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information
rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for

Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe. A
Priority Review designation is given to products that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The goal for completing a Priority Review is six months. </P>

months to consider certain information or obtain clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an
advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations
carefully when making decisions. In addition, for combination products, the FDA&#146;s review may include the participation of both the FDA&#146;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA&#146;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health,

Response Letter, or CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or
information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the
deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. </P>

benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary,
the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug&#146;s

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be
eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for
patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term
restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an
approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any
patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of
clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can
delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a
new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for
review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However,
an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new
clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an
existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year
exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical
trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Manufacturing Requirements </I></B></P>

depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones. Expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and
activity according to the protocol. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. </P>

authority such as the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that clinical and preclinical data establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates with an appropriate benefit to risk profile relevant to a particular indication,
and that the product can be manufactured under cGMP in a reproducible manner to deliver the product&#146;s intended performance in terms of its stability, quality, purity and potency. Until our submission is reviewed by a health authority, there is
no way to predict the outcome of their review. Even if the clinical studies meet their predetermined primary endpoints, and a registration dossier is accepted for filing, a health authority could still determine that an appropriate benefit to risk

as we continue our clinical trial and development programs for NS2 and our other product candidates. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $12.1 million and $9.6 million,
respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had total stockholders&#146; equity of $24.9 million and an accumulated deficit of $58.6 million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our clinical trials, research and development
programs and from our general and administrative expenses. In the future, we intend to continue to conduct research and development, clinical testing, regulatory compliance activities and, if NS2 or any of our other product candidates is approved,
sales and marketing activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in our incurring further significant losses for the next several years. </P>

and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Drug development is
a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of development, including after commencement of any of our clinical trials. In addition, success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials
will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Furthermore, our clinical trials will need to demonstrate
sufficient safety and efficacy for approval by regulatory authorities in larger patient populations. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. In
addition, only a small percentage of drugs under development result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. </P>

errors of metabolism, and the outcome of clinical trials of NS2 in one indication is unlikely to predict the outcome of clinical trials with NS2 in other indications. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our product candidates are, to our knowledge, new chemical entities, and unexpected problems related to such new technology may arise that can
cause us to delay, suspend or terminate our development efforts. NS2 administered as an eye drop has completed a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers. Prior to the commencement of our Phase II clinical trials in 2015, NS2 had not been
administered to humans by any other route. Further, NS2 has not demonstrated efficacy in humans for any disease other than our Phase IIa clinical trial of topical ocular NS2 in subjects with induced allergic conjunctivitis. Because NS2 is a novel
chemical entity with limited use in humans, short and long-term safety, as well as prospects for efficacy, are poorly understood and difficult to predict due to our and regulatory agencies&#146; lack of experience with them. Regulatory approval of
new product candidates such as NS2 can be more expensive and take longer than approval for other more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical product candidates. </P>

patients and their caregivers are symptoms associated with severe skin disease, SLS patients also manifest varying degrees of delay in mental development, spasticity, seizures and retinal disease. Due to expected low systemic exposure of NS2 when
administered topically to the skin, it is unlikely that NS2 will significantly affect the non-dermatologic conditions of SLS. Lack of effect in neurologic and ocular manifestations of SLS may negatively impact regulatory discussions with the FDA and
may also negatively impact reimbursement, pricing and commercial acceptance of NS2, if it is approved. </P>

in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other non-United States regulatory agencies. In addition, if others develop product candidates for the treatment of similar diseases, we would potentially compete with them for the enrollment in these
rare patient populations, which may adversely impact the rate of patient enrollment in and the timely completion of our current and planned clinical trials. Additionally, insufficient patient enrollment, may be a function of many other factors,
including the size and nature of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the timing and magnitude of disease symptom presentation, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant
disease, and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. Our inability to identify and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to
abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Delays in patient enrollment in the future as a result of these and other factors may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our clinical trials, which could prevent us from
completing these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our product candidates. Further, if our products are approved by regulatory agencies, we may not be able to identify sufficient number of patients to generate

product development, including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and/or effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure you that any such products that are approved

competitors have significantly greater financial, product candidate development, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining
regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, universities and private and public research institutes may be active in aldehyde research, and some could be in direct competition with us. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit
management, scientists, and clinical development personnel. We will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, registering subjects for clinical trials, and in identifying and in-licensing new product

changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may significantly delay or prevent
marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the
United States, the Medical Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement
methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formulas where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result
of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the
coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations
in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. </P>

reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and imposed
additional health policy reforms. Effective October&nbsp;1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of &#147;average manufacturer price&#148; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states.
Further, beginning in 2011, the Health Care Reform Law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may
require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law on our business, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing,
especially under Medicare, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The continuing efforts of the government,

marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include false claims
statutes and anti-kickback statutes. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal
government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving
remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This
statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formula managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors
protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not
qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over the past few years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged
promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then
used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to
reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several
states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer&#146;s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. </P>

one or more foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our product candidates. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is
subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. If reimbursement of our future products is
unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If

form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. While we have issued composition-of-matter patents in the United States and other countries for NS2, we
cannot be certain that the claims in our patent applications covering composition-of-matter of our other product candidates will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and courts in the United States or by
the patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in our issued composition-of-matter patents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for
the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not
actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products &#147;off-label.&#148; Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is
common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. In addition, there are possibly methods that can be employed to trap aldehydes that we have not conceived of or attempted to patent, and other parties may discover and patent
aldehyde trapping approaches and compositions that are similar to or different from ours. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent application process is subject to

respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity

certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect
to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain

be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to
prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our
technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally
equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with
respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock. The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require
that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i)&nbsp;the
purchaser&#146;s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii)&nbsp;a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii)&nbsp;a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure
requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>A substantial number of shares of our common stock could be sold into the public market in the near future, which could depress our stock price.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could reduce the prevailing market prices for our common
stock. Substantially all of our outstanding common stock are eligible for sale as are common stock issuable under vested and exercisable stock options. If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or the public
market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that
we deem appropriate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging
growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are
not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could
be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if we become a large accelerated filer, if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal
year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December&nbsp;31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three year period before that time, we would cease
to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a &#147;smaller reporting company&#148; which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from
disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and
proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for
our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are incurring significant increased costs and demands upon management as a result of operating as a
public company. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a
private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, annual,
quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC, and The NASDAQ Capital Market to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in
these areas such as &#147;say on pay&#148; and proxy access. Recent legislation permits smaller &#147;emerging growth companies&#148; to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from our Initial Public Offering.
We intend to continue to take advantage of this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the
current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in
which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies
to continue to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or
increase the prices of our products or services. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to
maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and
retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we fail to maintain proper and
effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors&#146; views of us and, as a result, the value of
our common stock. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to report upon the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. When and if we are a &#147;large accelerated filer&#148; or an &#147;accelerated filer&#148; and are no longer an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; each as defined in the Exchange
Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of
certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of
Section&nbsp;404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting
firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation,
testing, and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we need to upgrade our systems including information technology; implement additional financial and management controls,
reporting systems, and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, we have not had sufficient accounting and supervisory personnel with the
appropriate level of technical accounting experience and training necessary or adequate formally documented accounting policies and procedures to support, effective internal controls. As we grow, we will hire additional personnel and engage in
external temporary resources and may implement, document and modify policies and procedures to maintain effective internal controls. However, we may identify deficiencies and weaknesses or fail to remediate previously identified deficiencies in our
internal controls. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected or unremediated, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could cause us to fail to
meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our common stock to decline. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If securities or industry analysts do not publish
research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us,
our business, our market or our competitors. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If other securities or industry analysts do not commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be
negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock
could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We could be subject to securities class action litigation.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price
of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
management&#146;s attention and resources, which could harm our business. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

focused primarily on the development of new products for diseases caused by inflammation and inborn errors of metabolism that are thought to be related to naturally occurring toxic and pro-inflammatory chemical species known as aldehydes. We have
developed a series of aldehyde traps, molecules that are designed specifically to sequester and allow for the degradation of aldehydes. Our most advanced aldehyde trap, NS2, is a novel product candidate that we are developing for the treatment of:

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2015, we began clinical testing of NS2 in diseases where we believe aldehyde trapping may improve symptoms and slow or prevent disease progression. In
February 2016, we announced that the results of a randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase IIa clinical trial of NS2 ophthalmic solution in patients with allergic conjunctivitis demonstrated statistically and clinically
significant activity of NS2 over vehicle in reducing ocular itching and tearing. In the second quarter of 2016, we expect to report results of our randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase II clinical trial of NS2
ophthalmic solution in patients with noninfectious anterior uveitis. In the second or third quarter of 2016, we expect to report results of our randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase II clinical trial of a dermatologic
formulation of NS2 for the treatment of the skin manifestations of SLS. By the end of 2016, we expect to initiate Phase I clinical testing of a systemic formulation of NS2 in preparation for potential Phase II clinical trials in SLS, SSADH
Deficiency, and severe inflammatory crises. We are also developing aldehyde traps different from NS2 that have the potential to treat diseases other than those described above. All of our development timelines could be subject to adjustment
depending on recruitment rate, regulatory agency review, and other factors that could delay the initiation and completion of clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NS2 has
been tested in a variety of <I>in vitro</I> and preclinical models, and has demonstrated efficacy in trapping aldehydes, diminishing inflammation, reducing healing time, protecting key cellular constituents from aldehyde damage, and lowering the
potential for scarring or fibrosis. In cell models of SLS, NS2 has demonstrated trapping of fatty aldehydes, and in a knock-out mouse model of SSADH Deficiency, NS2 has demonstrated trapping of succinic semi-aldehyde in key organs. NS2 has completed
a variety of toxicity studies in animals and appears generally safe and well tolerated. </P>

based on market-based milestones, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the timing and number of shares that are most likely to vest and record the expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the milestone will be achieved.
We account for stock options to non-employees using the fair value approach. Stock options to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. </P>

input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate, (b)&nbsp;the expected volatility of our stock, (c)&nbsp;the expected term of the award and (d)&nbsp;the expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of a public
market for the trading of our common stock and a lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly
traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life
of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares over approximately the past four years. The resulting volatility estimate was 89%, and we have employed this
value throughout our calculations. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the

subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (NOLs) and certain other tax assets (tax attributes) to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of
certain stockholders increases by more than 50&nbsp;percentage points over such stockholders&#146; lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Transactions involving our common stock, even those outside our
control, such as purchases or sales by investors, within the testing period could result in an ownership change. A limitation on our ability to utilize some or all of our NOLs or credits could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and cash flows. In the past, we have undergone two ownership changes. However, our management believes that any limitation had sufficient &#147;Built-In-Gain&#148; to offset the Section&nbsp;382 of the Code limitation generated by the

and access to purchase materials at certain costs. Under the terms of the license and supply agreement, we are obligated to make milestone payments up to an aggregate of $2.15 million upon reaching certain development and regulatory milestones in
the development of the applicable product. Upon commercialization of the product containing the licensed technology, we would be obligated to pay royalties based on net sales subject to an annual cap. The license and supply agreement runs through
the 7th anniversary of the expiration of all patents licensed under the agreement, which we estimate to be April 2036, unless terminated earlier. The amounts payable pursuant to this agreement are not included in the table above as the timing of the
payments is uncertain. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The table above detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance pay obligations to certain of our
executive officers in the event of a not-for-cause termination under existing employment contracts. The cash amount for which we might be liable upon any such termination, based on current executive pay and bonus levels, could be up to approximately
$1.3 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2016, we entered into a sublease for approximately 3,188 additional square feet of office space to expand our headquarters in
Lexington, Massachusetts. The sublease expires in September 2017. The sublease provides for the payment of annual base rent in the amount of $67,000 payable in monthly installments and the requirement to pay certain operating expenses, taxes and
other fees in accordance with the terms of the master lease. </P>

evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, such as this annual report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed to
ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our
quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an evaluation of some components of our internal control over financial reporting. We also perform a separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of
providing the management report below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design, our implementation of

identified and sought to confirm that appropriate corrective actions, including process improvements, were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of our evaluation activities are to
monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes and procedures that we adjust as circumstances merit. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management utilized the criteria established in the Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Based on the assessment, our management has concluded that, as of
December&nbsp;31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company or Aldeyra) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on August&nbsp;13, 2004 as
Neuron Systems, Inc. On December&nbsp;20, 2012, the Company changed its name to Aldexa Therapeutics, Inc. and, on March&nbsp;17, 2014, the Company changed its name to Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. The Company is developing a treatment for diseases
related to high levels of aldehydes, naturally occurring pro-inflammatory toxins. The ongoing research and development activities will be subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States. Prior to marketing
in the United States, any drug developed by the Company must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act. The Company has limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical and clinical testing necessary to obtain regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that the Company will not encounter problems in the clinical trials
that will cause the Company or the FDA to delay or suspend clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s success will depend in part on its ability
to obtain patents and product license rights, maintain trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the property rights of others, both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that patents issued to or licensed by the
Company will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s principal activities to date include raising capital and research and development activities. </P>
 <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION </B></P>
 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Basis of Presentation and Management&#146;s Plans</I></B> &#150; The accompanying financial statements were prepared
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Liquidity and
Management&#146;s Plans</I></B> &#150; At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $58.6 million and cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $27.6 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;7, 2014, the Company closed its Initial Public Offering, in which 1,500,000 shares of common stock were sold at a price to the
public of $8.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $12.0 million. The offer and sale of all of the shares in the Initial Public Offering were registered under the Securities Act of the 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement
on Form S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-193204), which was declared effective by the SEC on May&nbsp;1, 2014. The Company raised approximately $10.0 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $0.8 million, $1.0 million
in prepaid offering and printing costs and other offering costs of $0.2 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;15, 2015, the Company sold, in a private
placement, an aggregate of approximately 1.1&nbsp;million shares of common stock at a price of $7.00 per share. Investors received warrants to purchase up to approximately 1.1&nbsp;million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $9.50. The
warrants will expire 3&nbsp;years from the date of issuance. The warrants do not include a net-exercise feature. The warrants may be redeemed by the Company at a price of $0.001 per share upon notice to the holders in the event that the closing bid
for Aldeyra&#146;s common stock for each of the fifteen consecutive trading days prior to such redemption is at least $20.00 per share and the average trading volume of Aldeyra&#146;s common stock during such period is 50,000 shares per day.
Following Aldeyra&#146;s notification to the warrant holders of its exercise of the redemption right under the warrants, each warrant holder will have the option to exercise their warrants prior to the redemption date rather than having them
redeemed. The Company raised approximately $7.1 million in net proceeds in the private placement of common stock and warrants. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;22, 2015, in a subsequent private placement, the Company sold an aggregate of
211,528 shares of common stock at a price of $9.33 per share and a warrant to purchase up to 211,528 shares of common stock at a price of $0.125 per share subject to the warrant. The exercise price of the warrant is $9.50 per share. The warrant will
expire 3 years from the date of issuance. The warrant does not include a net-exercise feature. The warrant may be redeemed by the Company at a price of $0.001 per share upon notice to the holder thereof in the event that the closing bid for
Aldeyra&#146;s common stock for each of the fifteen consecutive trading days prior to such redemption is at least $20.00 per share and the average trading volume of Aldeyra&#146;s common stock during such period is 50,000 shares per day. Following
Aldeyra&#146;s notification to the warrant holder of its exercise of the redemption right under the warrant, the warrant holder will have the option to exercise the warrant prior to the redemption date rather than having it redeemed. The Company
raised approximately $1.9 million in net proceeds in the private placement of common stock and a warrant to purchase common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On
May&nbsp;22, 2015, the Company raised approximately $19.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, through the issuance and sale of 2,822,500 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering,
including shares sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, as
discussed in Note 8, in November 2015, the Company amended its credit facility (the Credit Facility) with Pacific Western Bank (Pacific Western). Pacific Western agreed to make term loans in a principal amount of up to $5.0 million available to the
Company with proceeds to be used first to refinance outstanding loans from Pacific Western, second to fund expenses related to the Company&#146;s clinical trials, and the remainder for general working capital purposes. The term loans are to be made
available to the Company upon the following terms: (i)&nbsp;$2.0 million was made available on November&nbsp;10, 2014; and (ii)&nbsp;$3.0 million (the Tranche B Loan) is to be made available to the Company following the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including receipt of positive phase 2 data in either SLS or noninfectious anterior uveitis. Each term loan accrues interest from its date of issue at a variable annual interest rate equal to the greater of 2.0% plus prime or
5.25%&nbsp;per annum. Any term loan made is payable as interest-only prior to November 2016 and thereafter is payable in monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest over 36 months. The Credit Facility is collateralized by the
Company&#146;s assets, including its intellectual property. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s management believes that its currently available resources,
including amounts available under the Credit Facility, will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its obligations through at least the end of 2017. The Company will need to raise additional capital to implement its near-term
business plan. Additional funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, or meet financial covenants that could be implemented under the Company&#146;s term loans in
certain circumstances, it will be required to significantly decrease the amount of planned expenditures, and may be required to cease operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Curtailment of operations would cause significant delays in the Company&#146;s efforts to introduce its products to market, which is critical
to the realization of its business plan and the future operations of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Use of Estimates</I></B> &#150; The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with US&nbsp;GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates in the Company&#146;s financial statements relate to accruals,
including research and development costs, accounting for income taxes and the related valuation allowance, estimating the fair value of the Company&#146;s common and preferred stock, preferred stock warrants, purchase rights and warrant purchase
rights, and accounting for stock based compensation and the related fair value. Although these estimates are based on the Company&#146;s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially
differ from these estimates and assumptions. </P>

less as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of greater than three months as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of &#145;Government Securities and Obligations&#146; for an amount not less than 102% of their
value. The Company does not record an asset or liability related to the collateral as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit
rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with original maturities of greater than three months are
classified as marketable securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Marketable Securities </I></B>&#150; Marketable securities consist of government securities and
obligations with original maturities of more than 90 days. Investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive

The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740, <I>Income Taxes</I>, in reporting deferred income taxes. ASC 740 requires a company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for expected future income tax consequences of events that have
been recognized in the Company&#146;s financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions pursuant to ASC 740 which prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. If the tax position meets this threshold, the benefit to be recognized is measured as the tax
benefit having the highest likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in the provision for income taxes. Management is
not aware of any uncertain tax positions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Research and Development Costs</I></B> &#150; Research and development costs are charged

<I>Compensation &#150; Stock Compensation</I>. For options, the fair value of stock-based payments is estimated, on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For restricted stock, fair value is based on the fair value of the
stock on the date of grant. The resulting fair value for restricted stock and options expected to vest is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the applicable restricted stock
or option. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Equity instruments issued to nonemployees are accounted for under the provisions of ASC 718 and ASC 505-50, <I>Equity &#150;

computes net loss per share in accordance with the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between common stock and other participating securities based on their participation rights. The Company has determined that
their outstanding Series A and Series B Preferred Stock represents a participating security and as such the preferred shares are excluded from basic earnings per share. Net losses are not allocated to the preferred stockholders for computing net
loss per share under the two-class method because preferred stockholders do not have contractual obligations to share in the losses of the Company. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income allocable to common stockholders (after
reduction for preferred stock dividends assuming current income for the period had been distributed) by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding. </P>

No.&nbsp;2015-17 &#147;Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes&#148; (&#147;ASU 2015-17&#148;). To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and
assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This update is required to be effective for all&nbsp;public Companies for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Earlier application is permitted. We do not believe that ASU 2015-17 will have a material impact on our financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February of 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-02, &#147;Leases (Topic 842)&#148; (&#147;ASU 2016-02&#148;). Under ASU 2016-2, an
entity will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and
leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from leases. For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early
adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the future impact of ASU 2016-02 on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-03, &#147;Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs&#148; (&#147;ASU 2015-03&#148;).
The amendments in ASU 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU
2015-03 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-03 should be applied on a retrospective basis to each individual period presented. Upon implementation, the change in reporting
debt issuance costs will require the Company to reclassify any deferred financing costs from an asset to a reduction of the reported debt balance. The application of ASU 2015-03 is not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the
Company&#146;s financial position. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15, &#147;Disclosure of Uncertainties about an

price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are performed in a manner to maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820, <I>Fair Value Measurements</I>, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last
unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Level 1</B> &#150; Quoted prices in active markets that

subsequently amended in November 2013 to provide the Company with $1.5 million of available funds. The amended Credit Facility called for interest only payments at a 6.50% interest rate from November 2013 through November 2014 for all amounts
outstanding, at which point, the Company was scheduled to make principal payments of $58,160 plus interest through the maturity date of the term loans in November 2016. In November 2014, the Credit Facility was further amended. Pursuant to the
Credit Facility, Pacific Western agreed to make term loans in a principal amount of up to $5.0 million available to the Company with proceeds to be used first to refinance outstanding loans from Pacific Western second to fund expenses related to the
Company&#146;s clinical trials, and the remainder for general working capital purposes. The term loans are to be made available to the Company upon the following terms: (i)&nbsp;$2.0&nbsp;million was made available in November 2014; and
(ii)&nbsp;$3.0 million (the Tranche B Loan) is to be made available to the Company following the satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of positive phase 2 data in either Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) or noninfectious anterior
uveitis. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, $1.4 million was outstanding under the Credit Facility. Each term loan accrues interest from its date of issue at a variable annual interest rate equal to the greater of 2.0% plus prime or 5.25%&nbsp;per annum.
Any term loan made was payable as interest-only prior to November 2015 and thereafter was scheduled to be payable in monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest through the maturity date in November 2018. The amended Credit Facility was
amended again in November 2015 extending the interest only period and the Tranche B conditions. Each term loan accrues interest from its date of issue at a variable annual interest rate equal to the greater of 2.0% plus prime or 5.25%&nbsp;per
annum. The effective interest rate through December&nbsp;31, 2015 was 7.89%. Any term loan made is payable as interest-only prior to November 2016 and thereafter is payable in monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest over 36 months.
The Credit Facility is collateralized by the Company&#146;s assets, including its intellectual property. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, $1.4 million was outstanding under the Credit Facility. </P>

1986, as amended (Code), a corporation that undergoes an &#147;ownership change&#148; is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (NOLs) and certain other tax assets (tax attributes) to offset future
taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders&#146; lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally
three years). Transactions involving the Company&#146;s common stock, even those outside the Company&#146;s control, such as purchases or sales by investors, within the testing period could result in an ownership change. A limitation on the
Company&#146;s ability to utilize some or all of its NOLs or credits could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and cash flows. In the past, Aldeyra has undergone two ownership changes. However, the
Company&#146;s management believes that it had sufficient &#147;Built-In-Gain&#148; to offset the Section&nbsp;382 of the Code limitation generated by the ownership changes. Any future ownership changes may cause the Company&#146;s existing tax
attributes to have additional limitations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All tax years are open for examination by the taxing authorities for both federal and state

211,528 shares of common stock at a price of $0.125 per share subject to the warrant. The Company raised approximately $1.9 million in net proceeds in the private placement of common stock and a warrant to purchase common stock. In both
transactions, the exercise price of the warrants is $9.50 per share. The warrants will expire 3 years from their respective date of issuance. The warrants do not include a net-exercise feature. The warrants may be redeemed by the Company at a price
