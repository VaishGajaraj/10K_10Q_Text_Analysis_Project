corporation in 2004, and from inception until December&nbsp;20, 2012, we operated as Neuron Systems, Inc. and from December 2012 until March 2014 we operated as Aldexa Therapeutics, Inc. Since our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all of
our resources to the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues largely depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to complete the development of our product candidates to obtain the
regulatory approvals for and to manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates. The results of our operations will vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter and depend on a number of factors, including risks
related to our business and industry, risks relating to intellectual property and other legal matters, risks related to our common stock, and other risks that are detailed in the section of this annual report on Form 10-K entitled &#147;Risk
Factors.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a biotechnology company focused primarily on the development of new products for immune-mediated, inflammatory,
orphan and other diseases that are thought to be caused in part by naturally occurring toxic chemical species known as free aldehydes. We have developed a series of product candidates that are designed specifically to trap and allow for the
degradation of free aldehydes. In 2015, we plan to begin clinical testing of our most advanced product candidate, NS2, in diseases with significant unmet medical need where we believe aldehyde trapping may improve symptoms and slow or prevent
disease progression. Since the diseases we plan to study are rare, we intend to request orphan drug designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We intend to initiate a clinical trial of NS2, for the treatment of a disease called Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS), a rare condition
that we believe afflicts approximately 1,000 patients in the United States. The disease is </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
caused by mutations in an enzyme that metabolizes free fatty (generally 16-18 carbon) aldehydes, resulting in high levels of toxic aldehydes that are the suspected cause of severe skin disease,
mental delay, spasticity, and, in some patients, retinal dysfunction. NS2 has demonstrated fatty aldehyde trapping in human skin cells in preclinical studies. In order to attempt to improve the dermatologic symptoms of SLS, we plan to initiate Phase
II clinical testing of NS2 applied topically to the skin of SLS patients beginning in 2015. We are not aware of any therapy for SLS that has been approved by the FDA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Preclinical testing with NS2 suggests that aldehyde trapping has the potential to improve symptoms related to and slow or prevent the
progression of a variety of other diseases by reducing inflammation, promoting healing, diminishing the potential for scarring, and protecting a key lipid (fat) that is involved in lubricating the surface of the eye and preventing skin dryness. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that inflammatory diseases of the eye may also be mediated in part by free aldehyde toxicity. We have developed an eye drop
formulation of NS2 that has completed Phase I clinical testing for safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers. In 2015, we plan to initiate Phase II clinical trials of the NS2 eye drop formulation in a serious and, we believe, poorly treated
ocular disease called noninfectious anterior uveitis. In noninfectious anterior uveitis, aldehydes may mediate, at least in part, inflammation, fibrotic changes, and lipid destruction leading to dryness and surface irritation. Patients with
noninfectious anterior uveitis generally experience severe pain, sensitivity to light, and vision loss. We believe that novel medications are needed to improve symptoms and deter disease progression, especially in order to reduce dependence on

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Occurring generally as a result of a large number of metabolic processes, free aldehydes are naturally occurring endogenous chemical
species that, among other things, promote inflammation. At high levels, free aldehydes are toxic and are implicated as mediators of many immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. A variety of diseases are thought to be related to free aldehydes, at
least in part, including autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis), inflammatory diseases (e.g., uveitis), neurological disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis), cardiovascular disease (e.g., atherosclerosis) and endocrinologic disease
(e.g., diabetic nephropathy). We believe that the medical needs of the patients suffering from aldehyde-mediated diseases are not currently well addressed and that there is a large market potential for therapies that can lower free aldehyde levels.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may test our lead aldehyde trap product candidate, NS2, in diseases that we believe are likely to be mediated at least in part by free
aldehydes and that we view as poorly treated, if treated at all, by currently available medications. SLS, for which we intend to initiate Phase II testing in 2015 with NS2, is a rare condition that we believe affects approximately 1,000 patients in
the United States. In addition, we intend to initiate a Phase II clinical trial of NS2 in 2015 to test for efficacy in noninfectious anterior uveitis, also a rare disease. While the patient populations for rare diseases are limited, we believe that
reimbursement and pricing have the potential to be sufficient to generate significant revenues for approved therapies that offer significant advantages over standard of care. In 2015, we may initiate clinical trials with NS2 in other diseases
thought to be mediated in part by free aldehydes, and we may initiate development of an oral formulation of NS2 for diseases for which we believe systemic aldehyde trapping may provide therapeutic benefit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have discovered and synthesized other aldehyde traps that we may test in other diseases that afflict large populations worldwide, such as

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) is caused by a variety of mutations of an enzyme called Fatty Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (FALDH), leading to
the accumulation of fatty aldehydes or precursor molecules that are generally 16 to 18&nbsp;carbons in length. The aldehyde accumulation is thought to result in the pathology of the disease, which includes a severe skin disorder called ichthyosis,
as well as mental delay, spasticity, and, in some patients, retinal disorders. While FALDH dysfunction also leads to diminished levels of certain fatty acids, therapy with these fatty acids has been ineffective in SLS patients. SLS patients are
generally diagnosed as neonates given the severe ichthyosis that presents at birth. The disease persists lifelong, and SLS patients have a shortened lifespan, often expiring in the sixth decade of life. Some SLS patients are believed to inherit the
disease, though most occurrences of SLS appear to be due to sporadic mutations. The disease occurs worldwide. To our knowledge, Sweden is currently the only country to have estimated the prevalence of the disease, at 1&nbsp;per 250,000 people.
Extrapolating from the Swedish estimate, it is generally assumed that there are approximately 1,000 or fewer SLS patients in the United States and a larger number in Europe. We believe that many older SLS patients may be undiagnosed, potentially due
to the lack of available dermatologic and genetic medicine expertise available when those patients were younger. There is no treatment that is currently approved to treat SLS. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The primary day-to-day complaint of SLS patients and their caregivers is ichthyosis, a severe
skin disease characterized in SLS patients by thick, scaly, dry, wrinkled, pigmented, pruritic (itchy), inflamed skin. SLS patients are consistently disturbed by pruritus and often excoriate skin by scratching. The ichthyosis in SLS affects most of
the body, and is worse in flexure areas and the nape of the neck. There is currently no specific therapy approved for the treatment of the dermatologic disease in SLS, though some patients and their caregivers apply non-specific topical creams,
including keratinolytics (acids that soften skin), moisturizers, and retinoids. We believe that the effects of keratinolytic and moisturizing creams are minimal or non-existent in treating severe ichthyosis, and due to toxicity, retinoids are not
suitable for chronic use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The dermatologic disease in SLS is thought to be caused by aldehyde-mediated modification of lipids (fats) that
are generated in the epidermis (the most superficial layer of skin) to form a moisture barrier that holds water in the skin. Moisture barrier compromise leads to water loss, which in turn leads to dermal thickening characteristic of ichthyosis. We
believe that by lowering levels of aldehydes and thereby preventing lipid modification and the ensuing moisture barrier dysfunction, NS2, when applied topically to the skin, has the potential to ameliorate the dermatologic symptoms of SLS, deter
disease progression, and potentially cure the ichthyosis that occurs in SLS. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to estimate potential pricing for NS2 as a
dermatologic topical treatment for SLS, we have assumed pricing of another topical product for a rare dermatologic disease, Targretin<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>&nbsp;Gel for cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Assuming twice
per day treatment of 25% of the body surface area, and assuming a standard amount of cream per unit skin area, at the price per gram of Targretin<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>&nbsp;Gel, we believe that topically
administered NS2 could command pricing in excess of $200,000 per SLS patient per year. To verify reimbursement for such pricing, we contracted a third party reimbursement expert to interview numerous clinical directors for large payors, representing
in aggregate over 15&nbsp;million covered lives. Assuming NS2 efficacy that exceeds standard of care (non-specific keratinolytic and moisturizing creams) in a clinically significant manner, the payor interviews lend strong support to reimbursement
at annual per patient pricing in excess of $200,000. However, there can be no assurances regarding the actual reimbursement, pricing, or market penetration for our product candidates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Noninfectious anterior uveitis is an inflammatory ocular disease that is characterized by rapid-onset pain, sensitivity to light, and loss of
vision. The disease may occur with other autoimmune diseases. The annual incidence of noninfectious anterior uveitis in the United States is about 25,000 patients, and approximately one-third of these patients have one or more episodes per year.
Patients with recurrent episodes often develop cataracts, and severe cases may lead to glaucoma and retinal dysfunction. The disease is typically treated with topical corticosteroids, though prolonged used of corticosteroids increases the incidence
of cataracts and glaucoma in uveitis. Corticosteroids may also increase the incidence of infection and corneal ulceration. It has been estimated that uveitis is responsible for 10% of the blindness in the United States. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Free aldehyde levels are elevated in anterior uveitis patients. By trapping aldehydes, we believe NS2 may reduce inflammation in anterior
uveitis and reduce the burden of corticosteroid use. Because corticosteroids exacerbate the formation of cataracts and glaucoma in uveitis and may increase ocular infection and corneal ulceration, we believe that there is a high demand for a novel
topical anti-inflammatory agent to be used in conjunction with, or in place of, corticosteroids. We have not performed reimbursement or pricing surveys for noninfectious anterior uveitis. </P>

inflammatory factors, including NF-kB, an important protein in the inflammatory response. In many cases, aldehyde binding to cellular constituents leads to the formation of indigestible adducts
and aggregates that are pro-inflammatory and may lead to cellular dysfunction. Because of the inherent toxicity of aldehydes, most, if not all, living organisms contain enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenases that detoxify aldehydes. The toxicity of
aldehydes is evidenced by human studies showing an increased rate of cognitive decline, cancer, and cardiovascular disease in populations with diminished aldehyde dehydrogenase capacity. Additionally, most inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune
disease, neurodegenerative disease, and cardiovascular diseases, manifest elevated free aldehyde levels that apparently overwhelm endogenous aldehyde catabolic capacity. To our knowledge, there has never been a concerted pharmaceutical effort to
lower all free aldehyde levels. Thus, we believe that trapping aldehydes represents a novel platform for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and other diseases where aldehydes are implicated in pathogenesis. </P>

developing NS2, a new chemical entity, for the treatment of SLS and inflammatory diseases where we believe that free aldehyde-mediated toxicity is implicated. NS2 is a small molecule designed specifically to trap and allow for the degradation of
free aldehydes. In<I>&nbsp;in vitro</I>&nbsp;and animal studies, NS2 appears to have minimal pharmacology, meaning that it does not appear to affect most cellular components, including most receptors, enzymes and other proteins. NS2 has been shown
to bind and trap free aldehydes more rapidly than free aldehydes bind any cellular constituent. Evidence suggests that NS2 chemically binds to aldehydes, so-called NS2-aldehyde adducts, are rapidly transported to cellular lysosomes, where the adduct
is degraded within hours. Outside the lysosome, the adduct is remarkably stable, meaning that NS2-aldehyde binding is essentially irreversible<I>&nbsp;in vivo</I>, hence the notion of NS2 as an aldehyde trap. By essentially irreversibly binding free
aldehydes to form covalent adducts that are transported to lysosomes for degradation, NS2 has the potential to substantially lower aldehyde levels. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aside from increasing levels of inflammation, there is no generally accepted role of high levels of free aldehydes. Some physiologic molecules
have aldehyde forms, including retinaldehyde (a form of Vitamin A) and pyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate (forms of Vitamin B6), but these molecules are not free aldehydes in that they are tightly chaperoned and protected by proteins designed to
prevent the aldehydes from reacting with other molecules. As such, retinaldehyde and pyridoxal are likely not exposed to the cellular milieu, thereby precluding the non-specific binding that is characteristic of free aldehydes. Thus, aldehyde
trapping is expected<I>&nbsp;a priori</I>&nbsp;only to dampen inflammatory response and we believe would be predicted not to lead to overt toxicity. </P>

After systemic exposure to high levels of NS2, no signs of retinaldehyde deficiency on retinal function have been observed, nor have we observed any effects in animals that would suggest pyridoxal deficiencies. No significant toxicity has been
observed by us in an animal model when NS2 was administered as a 0.5% eye drop four times per day for up to nine months. No consistent toxicity was observed in animals topically treated once-daily with a 1% NS2 dermatologic formulation for 21 days.

chronically, including a study where animals were administered NS2 intravenously for 60 days. We currently have three Investigational New Drug (IND) filings with the FDA that are active and in
good standing relating to the clinical testing of NS2: as an eye drop for the treatment of aldehyde-mediated retinal disease, as an eye drop for the treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis, and as a dermal topical formulation for the treatment
of the dermatologic manifestations of SLS. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To our knowledge, levels of free aldehydes in tissue generally do not exceed 10&micro;M for
sustained durations, since, based on cell toxicity studies after exposure to free aldehydes, 10&micro;M concentrations can lead to significant cell death. In skin cell culture from patients with SLS, over 80% cell death has been observed at
60&micro;M concentrations of aldehydes; however, biopsies of SLS patients do not indicate cell death, suggesting that the actual aldehyde concentrations in the skin of SLS patients is far lower than 60&micro;M. In the tears of patients with dry eye,
aldehyde concentrations are estimated at 1&micro;M. Based on the totality of these results, we believe that the levels of aldehydes in SLS or other human diseases are likely significantly lower than 10&micro;M on a sustained basis. Relative to
aldehyde levels, concentrations of NS2 are generally higher in our pharmaceutical preparations and in the tissue of animals after NS2 administration. Eye drops containing 0.5% NS2 are greater than 20mM (20,000-fold greater than reported aldehyde
load in tears of dry eye patients), and a single drop results in anterior ocular tissue concentrations of greater than 15&micro;M in non-human primates. Likewise, NS2 concentrations in 1% dermatologic topical preparations are greater than 40mM, and
following 21 days of once-daily exposure to topical 1% NS2 in animals, dermal tissue levels of NS2 ranged from 10 to 30 &micro;M, with systemic levels of NS2 estimated to be less than 1 &micro;M. Given the potential to be able to administer NS2
topically in concentrations that far exceed predicted free aldehyde concentrations, we believe that NS2 will significantly lower free aldehyde loads in diseases where topical administration of NS2 is applicable. </P>

as well as numerous foreign counterparts to these patents and patent applications. We expect the issued NS2 composition of matter patent in the United States, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to
expire in 2028. It is possible that the term of the composition of matter patent in the United States may be extended up to five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. We expect the foreign NS2 composition of matter patents,
if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2026.&nbsp;We expect other patent applications in the portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental
fees are paid, to expire from 2026 to 2034. NS2 composition of matter patents have been issued in Australia, Canada, China, Europe (validated in about 14 member countries), Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia and South Korea. NS2 composition
of matter patent claims are pending in Brazil and India. </P>

disorders. We may also plan to utilize strategic partners or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of NS2, and with such partners, would seek to build awareness in the approved patient populations of the clinical utility of NS2.

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Various academic groups have published on the idea of reducing aldehyde levels, primarily by using compounds with primary amines (certain
nitrogen-containing compounds) that react with aldehydes through a well-known chemical process known as the Schiff base reaction. The Schiff base reaction is reversible, and generally the substrates (precursors) and products of the reaction exist in
equilibrium such that at any point in time, the aldehyde substrate may be bound or unbound. In this way, Schiff base reactions alone represent reversible and temporary aldehyde binding. Various amines have been described, particularly carnosine (a
naturally occurring dipeptide), which has a variety of additional potential mechanisms of action unrelated to aldehyde binding. At least one group has published on the use of certain nitrogen-containing marketed products to temporarily, in a
reversible manner, bind retinaldehyde as a potential therapy for retinal disease. We believe that NS2 and other novel aldehyde traps that we have discovered are differentiated from the above approaches in that the chemical structures are novel and
the reaction with free aldehydes is essentially irreversible<I>&nbsp;in vivo</I>, which we believe may result in a more effective means of diminishing aldehyde levels. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At least one company (Aldea Pharmaceuticals) has developed catalysts of aldehyde dehydrogenases in order to facilitate the catabolism of
certain aldehydes. Initial applications of this approach appear to include reducing levels of acetaldehyde, a product of ethanol consumption. While we believe that NS2 and other aldehyde traps may also diminish acetaldehyde levels, we do not, in the
near future, intend to pursue acetaldehyde reduction following ethanol consumption as a commercial opportunity. We do not believe that catalysis of specific aldehyde dehydrogenases would be likely to benefit disorders where aldehyde dehydrogenase
activity is missing due to genetic mutations. Further, we are not aware that any aldehyde dehydrogenase catalyst manifests anti-inflammatory activity. </P>

effectively marketed and sold, than any product that we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We
anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. In addition, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our

proven to be safe and effective, we believe that NS2 could be used in place of or in addition to current therapies, especially in instances where current therapies are toxic and reducing exposure to such therapies would be desirable. There is no
approved therapy for SLS. We believe that the current non-specific creams and medications for SLS are poorly effective, if effective at all. Topical corticosteroids for ocular inflammatory diseases are often associated with toxicity, including
corneal ulceration, cataracts, and glaucoma. While NS2 and other novel aldehyde traps may manifest efficacy and safety advantages over currently available therapies, many such therapies are generic or may be priced considerably lower than the NS2
pricing that we anticipate. Pricing factors may discourage the initial or prolonged use of NS2. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that there are no drugs in

include Abbvie, Inc., Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson, UCB Inc. and UCB S.A., Amgen, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., and Pfizer, Inc. As these products become used more commonly, they may begin to be used in the diseases that we intend to target, and

requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, manufacturing and control procedures and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the toxicity and
other safety characteristics of the product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some
preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30&nbsp;days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions and places the clinical
trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Even if the IND becomes effective and the trial proceeds without initial FDA objection, the FDA may stop the trial at
a later time if it has concerns, such as if unacceptable safety risks arise. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, an independent IRB, covering each site proposing to
conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor

Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is defined as one affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals where there is
no reasonable expectation that the product development cost will be recovered from product sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA and does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration

could include measures imposed by the FDA such as prescribing restrictions, requirements for post-marketing studies or certain restrictions on distribution and use. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a
substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. The FDA has 60&nbsp;days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will
be accepted for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be
resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or
PDUFA, the FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe. A Priority
Review designation is given to products that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The goal for completing a Priority Review is six months. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is likely that our product candidates will be granted a Standard Review. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional
months to consider certain information or obtain clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an
advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations
carefully when making decisions. In addition, for combination products, the FDA&#146;s review may include the participation of both the FDA&#146;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA&#146;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health,
which may complicate or prolong the review. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is
manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the FDA evaluates the NDA and, in some cases, the related manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete
Response Letter, or CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or
information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the
deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after
the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase&nbsp;IV studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power
to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA
approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms, such as a Black Box Warning, which highlights a
specific warning (typically life-threatening), or a REMS program. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a company may be required to submit and
obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require the company to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register
their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and
generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that
we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. </P>

Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use
the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA
determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health
care providers of the drug&#146;s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy
at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy&#146;s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our United States patents may be
eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for
patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term
restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an
approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any
patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of
clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can
delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a
new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for
review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However,
an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new
clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an
existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year
exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical
trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Manufacturing Requirements </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to FDA&#146;s cGMP regulations and, if applicable,
quality system regulation requirements for medical devices. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers
and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP
requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA
and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer
to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, voluntary corrective action, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and
civil and criminal penalties. </P>

suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and generate revenues. Compliance with applicable environmental

collaboration partners at certain stages of clinical development. As we obtain results from clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus our resources on more
promising product candidates or programs. Completion of clinical trials by us or our future collaborators may take several years or more, the length of time generally varying with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product

trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of
these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price. Payments under the contracts
depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones. Expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and
activity according to the protocol. If timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. </P>

as we continue our clinical trial and development programs for NS2 and our other product candidates. Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $(9.6)&nbsp;million and
$1.1&nbsp;million, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had total stockholders&#146; equity of $6.3&nbsp;million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our clinical trials, research and development programs and from our
general and administrative expenses. In the future, we intend to continue to conduct research and development, clinical testing, regulatory compliance activities and, if NS2 or any of our other product candidates is approved, sales and marketing
activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in our incurring further significant losses for the next several years. </P>

that is believed to trap and allow for the degradation of free aldehydes, toxic chemical species suspected to cause and exacerbate numerous diseases in humans and animals. We are largely dependent on successful continued development and ultimate
regulatory approval of this product candidate for our future business success. We have invested, and will continue to invest, a significant portion of our time and financial resources in the development of NS2. We will need to raise sufficient funds
for, and successfully enroll and complete, our planned clinical trials of NS2, which we intend to commence in 2015. The future regulatory and commercial success of this product candidate is subject to a number of risks, including the following: </P>

candidates, raise capital, expand our business, or continue our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The scientific rationale for our Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson Syndrome clinical
program does not necessarily predict the clinical success of NS2. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) is a rare disease afflicting
an estimated 1 in 250,000 people worldwide, equivalent to approximately 1,000 patients in the United States and a larger number in Europe. SLS is caused by genetic mutations in an enzyme, Fatty Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (FALDH) that converts long-chain
aldehydes into fatty acids. In addition to manifesting what is believed to be severe aldehyde toxicity, SLS patients also have elevated levels of fatty alcohols and may manifest diminished levels of fatty acids. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The dermal pathology of SLS is thought to be due to aldehyde-mediated damage of lipids (fats) that contribute to the formation of the dermal
moisture barrier. As a result, SLS patients are thought to lose water from skin, leading to compensatory mechanisms that include proliferation of the superficial layers of skin that may be only partially effective in preventing water loss. Increased
levels of skin proliferation in SLS patients lead to ichthyosis, a severe skin disorder characterized by plaques and scales, thickening, dryness, redness, inflammation and pruritus (itching). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NS2 traps aldehydes and has been shown to prevent fatty aldehyde-mediated modification of lipids<I>&nbsp;in vitro</I>, in human skin cells and
in cells that have been genetically modified to lack FALDH. Thus, NS2 may be partially or wholly effective in preventing and treating ichthyosis or other dermal symptoms, signs, or pathologies in SLS. However, the proposed mechanism of action of NS2
in SLS has not been demonstrated in humans. Further, our assumptions about the pathogenesis of skin disease in SLS patients may not be accurate. For instance, SLS skin disease may be caused by elevated fatty alcohol levels or decreased fatty acid
levels, neither of which NS2 is predicted to affect directly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the presumed mechanisms of aldehyde-mediated inflammation are
distinct from the presumed aldehyde-mediated pathology in SLS, and the outcome of clinical trials of NS2 in SLS is unlikely to predict the outcome of clinical trials with NS2 in inflammatory diseases. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not always predictive of future results. Any product candidate we or any of our future
development partners advance into clinical trials, including NS2, may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Drug development has inherent risk. We or any of our future development partners will be required to demonstrate through adequate and
well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Drug development is a
long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of development, including after commencement of any of our clinical trials. In addition, success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials
will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Furthermore, our future trials will need to demonstrate
sufficient safety and efficacy for approval by regulatory authorities in larger patient populations. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. In
addition, only a small percentage of drugs under development result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our product candidates are, to our knowledge, new chemical entities, and unexpected problems related to such new technology may arise that can
cause us to delay, suspend or terminate our development efforts. NS2 administered as an eye drop has completed a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers. NS2 has not been administered to humans by any other route. Further, NS2 has not
demonstrated efficacy in humans for any disease. Because NS2 is a novel chemical entity with limited use in humans, short and long-term safety, as well as prospects for efficacy, are poorly understood and difficult to predict due to our and
regulatory agencies&#146; lack of experience with them. Regulatory approval of new product candidates such as NS2 can be more expensive and take longer than approval for other more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or
biopharmaceutical product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Aldehyde trapping is an unproven approach, the safety and efficacy of which has not been demonstrated in
humans. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aldehydes are thought to be mediators of inflammation and other pathology. However, we are aware of only a limited number
of attempts to lower aldehyde levels and modulate disease in animals or humans. Thus, there is only moderate justification for the approach of lowering aldehyde levels to treat disease. Despite evidence suggestive of benefit in animal models,
clinical trials may indicate that aldehyde trapping has no effect or negative effects on the diseases we intend to test. Animal studies may not predict safety or efficacy in humans. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our dermatologic topical formulation of NS2 is unlikely to affect other clinical manifestations of SLS, which may decrease the likelihood of regulatory
and commercial acceptance. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the primary day-to-day complaint of SLS patients and their caregivers are symptoms associated
with severe skin disease, SLS patients also manifest varying degrees of mental delay, spasticity, seizures and retinal disease. Due to expected low systemic exposure of NS2 when administered topically to the skin, it is unlikely that NS2 will affect
the non-dermatologic conditions of SLS. Lack of effect in neurologic and ocular manifestations of SLS may negatively impact regulatory discussions with the FDA and may also negatively impact reimbursement, pricing and commercial acceptance of NS2.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The FDA or other regulatory agencies may prohibit us from initiating clinical trials that are necessary for demonstrating drug safety and efficacy
in patients. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NS2 and the activities associated with its development and potential commercialization, including its testing,
manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable
authorities in other jurisdictions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are not permitted to test a drug under a new IND in the United States until the FDA has no
objection to the initial IND submission. To date, we have completed one Phase&nbsp;I clinical trial for NS2 administered as an eye drop in healthy volunteers. In 2014, we filed two IND applications to initiate a Phase II clinical trial in SLS and a
Phase II trial in noninfectious anterior uveitis. We will have to submit separate INDs for each additional indication that we intend to study, which could mean additional delays in the commencement of each of the related trials and the performance
of additional preclinical studies. We have not demonstrated efficacy of NS2 in any patient population. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is no guarantee that future
trials will be allowed by the FDA to proceed or generate successful results, or that regulators will agree with our assessment of the clinical trials for NS2. In addition, we expect to rely on consultants and third party contract research
organizations to assist us with regulatory filings and the conduct of our clinical trials. The FDA and other regulators have substantial discretion and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our current data is insufficient for

manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion
of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and
has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. </P>

experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, universities and private and public research institutes may be active in aldehyde research, and some could be in direct competition with us. We also may compete
with these organizations to recruit management, scientists, and clinical development personnel. We will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, registering subjects for clinical trials, and in identifying

capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Future
growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management and require us to retain additional internal capabilities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete

and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the
marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more
stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the Medical Modernization Act of
2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs.
In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part&nbsp;D prescription drug plans to use formulas where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of
federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any
approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates,
and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In early
2010, President Obama signed into law the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency
requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and imposed additional health policy reforms. Effective October&nbsp;1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of
&#147;average manufacturer price&#148; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, beginning in 2011, the Health Care Reform Law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture
or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. Although it is too early to determine the
effect of the Health Care Reform Law on our business, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under Medicare, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. </P>

restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws
include false claims statutes and anti-kickback statutes. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the
federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or
receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs.
This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formula managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe
harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they
do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over the past few years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged
promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then
used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to
reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several
states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer&#146;s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. </P>

subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. If reimbursement of our future products is
unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. </P>

of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. While we have issued composition-of-matter patents in the United States and other countries for NS2, we cannot
be certain that the claims in our patent applications covering composition-of-matter of our other product candidates will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and courts in the United States or by the
patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in our issued composition-of-matter patents will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the
specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not
actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products &#147;off-label.&#148; Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is
common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. In addition, there are possibly methods that can be employed to trap aldehydes that we have not conceived of or attempted to patent, and other parties may discover and patent
aldehyde trapping approaches and compositions that are similar to or different from ours. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The patent application process is subject to

United States Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents we might
obtain in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we have issued composition-of-matter patents covering NS2 in the United States and other countries, filing, prosecuting and defending
patents on NS2 and our other product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United
States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our
inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not
obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete
with our product candidates and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The
legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for
us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our
efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We
may not prevail in any lawsuits </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2014. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013, the outstanding principal balance under the Credit Facility was approximately $1.4 million. The term loans under the Credit Facility are to be made available to us upon
the following terms: (i)&nbsp;$2,000,000 was made available on November&nbsp;10, 2014; and (ii)&nbsp;$3,000,000 (the Tranche B Loan) is to be made available to us following the satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of positive phase
2 data in either SLS or noninfectious anterior uveitis However, we can provide no assurances that we will satisfy the conditions for the Tranche B Loan. The loan agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default.
Affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports and maintain insurance coverage. Negative covenants include, among others, restrictions
on transferring any part of our business or property, changing our business, including changing the composition of our executive team or board of directors, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or
making other distributions, making investments and creating other liens on our assets and other financial covenants, in each case subject to customary exceptions. If we default under the terms of the loan agreement, including failure to satisfy our
operating covenants, the lender may accelerate all of our repayment obligations and take control of our pledged assets, potentially requiring us to renegotiate our agreement on terms less favorable to us or to immediately cease operations. Further,
if we are liquidated, the lender&#146;s right to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock. The lender could declare a default upon the occurrence of any event that they interpret as a material adverse effect as
defined under the loan agreement. Any declaration by the lender of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. If we raise any additional debt financing, the terms
of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit

a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $16.2 million and $13.4 million, respectively, and federal and state research and
development credits of approximately $392,000 and $45,000, respectively, which could be limited if we experience an &#147;ownership change.&#148; Any such limitations would generally be equal to our equity value at the time of the ownership change

equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with
respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock. The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require
that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i)&nbsp;the
purchaser&#146;s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii)&nbsp;a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii)&nbsp;a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure
requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares. </P>

disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute
payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if we become a large accelerated filer, if we have total annual gross revenue
of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December&nbsp;31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three
year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a &#147;smaller reporting company&#148; which would allow us to take
advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a biotechnology company focused primarily on the development of products to treat immune-mediated, inflammatory, orphan, and other diseases that are
related to free aldehydes, a naturally occurring toxic chemical species. We discovered and are developing NS2, a novel product candidate that is designed to trap and allow for the disposal of free aldehydes, for the treatment of Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson
Syndrome (SLS), a rare disease caused by mutations in an enzyme that metabolizes fatty aldehydes, and noninfectious anterior uveitis, an inflammatory eye disease. NS2 has been tested in a variety of in vitro and preclinical models, and has
demonstrated efficacy in trapping free aldehydes, diminishing inflammation, reducing healing time, protecting key cellular constituents from aldehyde damage, and lowering the potential for scarring or fibrosis. NS2 has completed a variety of
toxicity studies in animals and appears generally safe and well-tolerated. We are also in the early stages of developing aldehyde traps different from NS2 that have the potential to treat diseases other than those described above. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have evaluated NS2 in a Phase I clinical trial in 48 healthy volunteers where NS2 was observed to be safe and well tolerated when administered as an eye
drop up to four times per day over seven days. In 2014, we filed two Investigational New Drug (IND) applications to initiate a Phase&nbsp;II clinical trial in SLS and a Phase II trial in noninfectious anterior uveitis. Data from all of these
clinical trials are currently expected to be available in the second half of 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have no products approved for sale, and we have not generated any
revenue from product sales or other arrangements. We have primarily funded our operations through the sale of our convertible preferred stock, common stock, convertible promissory notes, warrants and borrowings under our loan and security
agreements. In May 2014, we closed our initial public offering (Initial Public Offering) whereby we received net proceeds of approximately $10.1&nbsp;million, after underwriter discounts, expenses and commissions, through the sale of 1,500,000
shares of our common stock at $8.00 per share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2015, we sold an aggregate of approximately 1.1&nbsp;million shares of common stock at a price
of $7.00 per share in a private placement. Investors received warrants to purchase up to approximately 1.1&nbsp;million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $9.50. In a subsequent private placement in January 2015, we sold an aggregate of
211,528 shares of common stock at a price of $9.33 per share and a warrant to purchase up to 211,528 shares of common stock at a price of $0.125 per share subject to the warrant. The exercise price of the warrant is $9.50 per share. We received net
proceeds of approximately $9.1&nbsp;million, after placement agent fees and expenses from these two private placements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We will need to raise additional
capital in the form of debt or equity to fund additional development of NS2 or other aldehyde traps, and we may in-license, acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products. In addition, as capital resources permit, we may augment or
otherwise modify the clinical development plan described herein. </P>

and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United&nbsp;States (US GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate
these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stock-based compensation expense represents the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards and stock option grants, which are being
recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. For stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining
service period after the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. We generally estimate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. If vesting is
based on market-based milestones, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the timing and number of shares that are most likely to vest and record the expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the milestone will be achieved.
We account for stock options to non-employees using the fair value approach. Stock options to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We generally estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate, (b)&nbsp;the expected volatility of our stock, (c)&nbsp;the expected term of the award and (d)&nbsp;the expected dividend yield. Due to the
lack of a public market for the trading of our common stock and a lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that
are publicly traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the
expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares over approximately the past four years. The resulting volatility estimate was 89%, and we have
employed this value throughout our calculations. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected life of our
employee stock options using the &#147;simplified&#148; method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option for service-based awards. The risk-free interest rates for periods
within the expected life of the option are based on the yields of zero-coupon United States Treasury securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The assumptions used in

ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company&#146;s ability to
continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The standard will be effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. Upon adoption the Company will use the guidance in ASU 2014-15 to assess going concern. </P>

ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately $9.6 million, which includes non-cash items of a deemed dividend on preferred securities of $4.1
million and the effect of a change in fair value of preferred stock warrant liabilities of approximately $2.3 million. We expect to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2012, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the Credit Facility) with Square 1 Bank (Square 1) with availability in the amount of $500,000
to help fund our operations. The Credit Facility was subsequently amended in November 2013 to provide us with an additional $1.0 million of available funds. We received an advance payment of $1.0 million in November 2013 through a term loan. The
amended Credit Facility called for interest only payments at a 6.50% interest rate from November 2013 through November 2014 for all amounts outstanding, inclusive of those amounts originally drawn during 2012 prior to the amendment, at which point,
we are required to make principal payments of $58,160 plus interest through the maturity date of the term loans in November 2016. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, $1,395,833 was outstanding under the Credit Facility. In November 2014, we amended the
Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Credit Facility, Square 1 agreed to make term loans in a principal amount of up to $5,000,000 available to us with proceeds to be used first to refinance outstanding loans from Square 1, second to fund expenses
related to our clinical trials, and the remainder for general working capital purposes. The term loans are to be made available to us upon the following terms: (i)&nbsp;$2,000,000 was made available in November 2014; and (ii)&nbsp;$3,000,000 (the
Tranche B Loan) is to be made available to us following the satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of positive phase 2 data in either Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) or noninfectious anterior uveitis. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014,
$1,395,833 was outstanding under the Credit Facility. Each term loan accrues interest from its date of issue at a variable annual interest rate equal to the greater of 2.0% plus prime or 5.25%&nbsp;per annum. Any term loan made is payable as
interest-only prior to November 2015 and thereafter is payable in monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest over 36 months. The Credit Facility is collateralized by our assets, including our intellectual property. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;7, 2014, we closed our Initial Public Offering whereby we received net proceeds of approximately $10.1&nbsp;million, after underwriter discounts,
expenses and commissions, through the sale of 1,500,000 shares of our common stock at $8.00 per share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as
of December&nbsp;31, 2014, together with the net proceeds from our January 2015 private placements and amounts available under the Credit Facility, will be adequate to fund operations through approximately the end of 2016. However, these amounts
will not be sufficient for us to commercialize our product candidates or conduct any substantial, additional development requirements requested by the FDA. At this time, due to the risks inherent in the drug development process, we are unable to
estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued clinical development of NS2. Subsequent trials initiated at a later date will cost considerably more, depending on the results of our prior clinical trials, and feedback from the
FDA or other third parties. Accordingly, we will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend
on many factors, including but not limited to: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

Disclosure Committee and our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form
10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an evaluation of some
components of our internal control over financial reporting. We also perform a separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management report below. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design, our implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls
on the information generated for use in this Annual Report on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Form&nbsp;10-K.</FONT> In the course of the controls evaluation, we reviewed data errors or control problems identified and sought to confirm that
appropriate corrective actions, including process improvements, were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief
Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of our evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them
as necessary. We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes and procedures that we adjust as circumstances merit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on our

that the director is not also one of our employees and has not engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, as further required by the NASDAQ rules, our board of directors has made a subjective determination as to each
independent director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In making these determinations, our
directors reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director&#146;s business and personal activities as they may relate to us and our management. </P>

Incentive Plan. For purposes of our automatic director grant program, a non-employee director is a director who is not employed by us and who does not receive compensation from us or have a business relationship with us that would require disclosure
under certain Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Each non-employee director joining our board of directors will automatically be granted a non-statutory stock option to purchase 12,166&nbsp;shares of common stock with an exercise price equal
to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. This initial option will vest ratably in annual installments over 3 years of service following the date of grant. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, on the date of each annual meeting of our stockholders, each non-employee director will automatically be granted a non-statutory
stock option to purchase 6,083&nbsp;shares of our common stock on that date with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. A non-employee director who receives an initial award will not receive the
additional annual award in the same calendar year. Automatic annual grants vest in full on the one-year anniversary of the grant date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If
we are subject to a change in control, then all of the director&#146;s automatic grants will become fully vested. All automatic director options have a maximum term of ten years. </P>

required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material

Neuron Systems, Inc. On December&nbsp;20, 2012, the Company changed its name to Aldexa Therapeutics, Inc. and on March&nbsp;17, 2014 the Company changed its name to Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. The Company is developing a treatment for diseases
related to high levels of free aldehydes, naturally occurring pro-inflammatory toxins. The ongoing research and development activities will be subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States. Prior to
marketing in the United States, any drug developed by the Company must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act. The Company has limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical and clinical testing necessary to obtain regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that the Company will not encounter problems in the clinical
trials that will cause the Company or the FDA to delay or suspend clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s success will depend in part on its
ability to obtain patents and product license rights, maintain trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the property rights of others, both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that patents issued to or
licensed by the Company will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Company. </P>

public of $8.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $12.0 million. The offer and sale of all of the shares in the Initial Public Offering were registered under the Securities Act of the 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement
on Form S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-193204), which was declared effective by the SEC on May&nbsp;1, 2014. The offering commenced as of May&nbsp;1, 2014 and did not terminate before all of the securities registered in the registration statement were sold.
Aegis Capital Corp. acted as the sole manager of the offering and as representative of the underwriters. The Company raised approximately $10.1&nbsp;million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $0.8&nbsp;million,

$9.33 per share and a warrant to purchase up to 211,528 shares of common stock at a price of $0.125 per share subject to the warrant. The exercise price of the warrant is $9.50 per share. The warrant will expire 3 years from the date of issuance.
The warrant does not include a net-exercise feature. The warrant may be redeemed by the Company at a price of $0.001 per share upon notice to the holder thereof in the event that the closing bid for Aldeyra&#146;s common stock for each of the
fifteen consecutive trading days prior to such redemption is at least $20.00 per share and the average trading volume of Aldeyra&#146;s common stock during such period is 50,000 shares per day. Following Aldeyra&#146;s notification to the warrant
holder of its exercise of the redemption right under the warrant, the warrant holder will have the option to exercise the warrant prior to the redemption date rather than having it redeemed. The company raised approximately $2.0 million in net
proceeds in the private placement of common stock and a warrant to purchase common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, as discussed in Note 7, in November
2014, the Company amended its credit facility (the Credit Facility) with Square 1. Square 1 agreed to make term loans in a principal amount of up to $5,000,000 available to the Company with proceeds to be used first to refinance outstanding loans
from Square 1, second to fund expenses related to the Company&#146;s clinical trials, and the remainder for general working capital purposes. The term loans are to be made available to the Company upon the following terms: (i)&nbsp;$2,000,000 was
made available on November&nbsp;10, 2014; and (ii)&nbsp;$3,000,000 (the Tranche B Loan) is to be made available to the Company following the satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of positive phase 2 data in either SLS or
noninfectious anterior uveitis. Each term loan accrues interest from its date of issue at a variable annual interest rate equal to the greater of 2.0% plus prime or 5.25%&nbsp;per annum. Any term loan made is payable as interest-only prior to
November 2015 and thereafter is payable in monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest over 36 months. The Credit Facility is collateralized by the Company&#146;s assets, including its intellectual property. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s management believes that its currently available resources, including funds obtained from the January 2015 private
placements and amounts available under the Credit Facility, will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its obligations through at least the end of 2016. The Company will need to raise additional capital to implement its near-term
business plan. Additional funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, or meet financial covenants that could be implemented under the Company&#146;s term loans in
certain circumstances, it will be required to significantly decrease the amount of planned expenditures, and may be required to cease operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Curtailment of operations would cause significant delays in the Company&#146;s efforts to introduce its products to market, which is critical
to the realization of its business plan and the future operations of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Use of Estimates</I></B> &#150; The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with US&nbsp;GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates in the Company&#146;s financial statements relate to accruals,
including research and development costs, accounting for income taxes and the related valuation allowance, estimating the fair value of the Company&#146;s common and preferred stock, preferred stock warrants, purchase rights and warrant purchase
rights, and accounting for stock based compensation and the related fair value. Although these estimates are based on the Company&#146;s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially
differ from these estimates and assumptions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Segment Information </I></B>&#150; Operating segments are defined as components of an

&#150; The Company&#146;s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Substantially all of the Company&#146;s cash is held at one financial institution that management
believes to be of high-credit quality. Deposits with these financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. </P>

as incurred and included in operating expenses. At December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, the Company has determined that these expenses have not met the criteria to be capitalized. Intellectual property related expenses for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013 were $184,517 and $189,965, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Income Taxes</I></B> &#150; The Company follows the
provisions of FASB ASC 740, <I>Income Taxes</I>, in reporting deferred income taxes. ASC 740 requires a company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the
Company&#146;s financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions pursuant to ASC 740 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
process for financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. If the tax position meets this threshold, the benefit to be recognized is measured as the tax benefit having the highest likelihood
of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in the provision for income taxes. Management is not aware of any uncertain tax
positions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Research and Development Costs</I></B> &#150; Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research
and development expenses include consulting expenses, preclinical studies, clinical trials, clinical trial materials, regulatory and clinical consultants, lab supplies, lab services, lab equipment maintenance and small equipment purchased to support
the research laboratory. Research and development costs that are paid in advance of performance are capitalized as a prepaid expense until incurred. </P>

<I>Compensation &#150; Stock Compensation</I>. For options, the fair value of stock-based payments is estimated, on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For restricted stock, fair value is based on the fair value of the
stock on the date of grant. The resulting fair value for restricted stock and options is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the applicable restricted stock or option. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Equity instruments issued to nonemployees are accounted for under the provisions of ASC 718 and ASC 505-50, <I>Equity &#150; Equity-Based

two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between common stock and other participating securities based on their participation rights. The Company has determined that their outstanding Series A and Series B Preferred
Stock represents a participating security and as such the preferred shares are excluded from basic earnings per share. Net losses are not allocated to the preferred stockholders for computing net loss per share under the two-class method because
preferred stockholders do not have contractual obligations to share in the losses of the Company. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income allocable to common stockholders (after reduction for preferred stock dividends assuming
current income for the period had been distributed) by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Diluted net (loss) income
per share is computed using the more dilutive of (a)&nbsp;the two-class method, or (b)&nbsp;the if-converted method or treasury stock method, as applicable, to the potentially dilutive instruments. The Company allocates net income first to preferred
stockholders based on dividend rights and then to common and preferred stockholders based on ownership interests. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding gives effect to all potentially dilutive common equivalent shares, including
outstanding stock options and restricted stock, warrants, rights to purchase additional shares of preferred stock, rights for warrants to purchase preferred stock and convertible debt. </P>

Concern (ASU 2014-15). ASU 2014-15 provides GAAP guidance on management&#146;s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For
each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements
are issued. The standard will be effective for annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting
periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. Upon adoption the Company will use the guidance in ASU 2014-15 to assess going concern. </P>

quarterly period ended June&nbsp;30, 2014. Prior to the Company&#146;s adoption of this guidance, the Company was a development stage entity because it devoted substantially all of its efforts to research and development of products to treat
diseases for which planned principal operations have not commenced. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of operations or cash flows other than the removal of

 <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximated their estimated fair
values because of the short term nature of these financial instruments. The carrying value of the Company&#146;s credit facility and convertible notes &#150; related parties in current and long-term liabilities approximates fair value because the
Company&#146;s interest rate yield (which is considered to be a level&nbsp;2 input) is near current market rates available to the Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are performed in a manner to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ASC 820, <I>Fair Value Measurements</I>, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable,
that may be used to measure fair value, which are the following: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Level 1</B> &#150; Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible
at the market date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Level 2</B> &#150; Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable,
either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Level 3</B> &#150; Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no

principal amount of $170,000, which was amended in February 2014 to extend its maturity date. The amendment to the note was determined to be a modification in accordance with ASC 470, <I>Debt</I>, and did not result in extinguishment. The note
accrued interest at a rate of 6%&nbsp;per annum, and was to become due and payable in June 2014 unless converted into shares of the Company&#146;s capital stock prior to such time pursuant to its terms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company recorded the difference between the current Series B Preferred Stock Conversion price and the fair value of the Series B Preferred
Stock at the date of issuance, limited to the face amount of the convertible promissory note of $170,000, as a beneficial conversion feature. This was reflected as a debt discount and was amortized to interest expense through the note&#146;s
maturity date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon the Company&#146;s Initial Public Offering in May 2014, the note automatically converted into 21,250 shares of the

with availability in the amount of $500,000 to help fund operations of the Company. The Credit Facility was subsequently amended in November 2013 to provide the Company with an additional $1.0 million of available funds. The Company received an
advance payment of $1.0 million in November 2013 through a term loan. The amended Credit Facility called for interest only payments at a 6.50% interest rate from November 2013 through November 2014 for all amounts outstanding, inclusive of those
amounts originally drawn during 2012 prior to the amendment, at which point, the Company is required to make principal payments of $58,160 plus interest through the maturity date of the term loans in November 2016. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013,
$1,395,833 was outstanding under the Credit Facility. In November 2014, the Company and Square 1 amended the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Credit Facility, Square 1 agreed to make term loans in a principal amount of up to $5,000,000 available to
the Company with proceeds to be used first to refinance outstanding loans from Square 1, second to fund expenses related to the Company&#146;s clinical trials, and the remainder for general working capital purposes. The term loans are to be made
available to the Company upon the following terms: (i)&nbsp;$2,000,000 was made available in November 2014; and (ii)&nbsp;$3,000,000 (the Tranche B Loan) is to be made available to the Company following the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including receipt of positive phase 2 data in either Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson Syndrome (SLS) or noninfectious anterior uveitis. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, $1,395,833 was outstanding under the Credit Facility. Each term loan accrues interest from its
date of issue at a variable annual interest rate equal to the greater of 2.0% plus prime or 5.25%&nbsp;per annum. Any term loan made is payable as interest-only prior to November 2015 and thereafter is payable in monthly installments of principal
plus accrued interest over 36 months. The Credit Facility is collateralized by the Company&#146;s assets, including its intellectual property. </P>

exercisable for 9,692 shares of Series B Preferred Stock with an exercise price of $5.16 per share and a term of seven years (Note 11). The warrant was valued at $177,952 and, together with the fair value of the warrant issued in connection with the
April&nbsp;12, 2012 Credit Facility ($88,100), was recorded as a discount on the Credit Facility. These discounts are being amortized using the effective interest method through the current maturity date of the Credit Facility in November 2018. The
amendment to the credit facility was determined to be a modification in accordance with ASC 470, <I>Debt</I> and did not result in extinguishment. </P>

likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based on the weight of available evidence, primarily the incurrence of net losses since inception, anticipated net losses in the near future, reversals of
existing temporary differences and expiration of various federal and state attributes, the Company does not consider it more likely than not that some or all of the net deferred taxes will be realized. Accordingly, a 100% valuation allowance has
been applied against net deferred taxes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had Federal and State income tax net operating loss

increasing research activities (&#147;R&amp;D tax credits&#148;) of approximately $392,000 and $45,000, respectively, which will expire at various dates through 2034. </P>

recorded over the remaining vesting period of approximately four years. On October&nbsp;30, 2013 the vesting provisions for certain of these options were revised and became based on the Company&#146;s Closing Market Capitalization, as defined. This
modification resulted in an increased value from the original grant date of approximately $322,000 and was determined based on Monte Carlo simulations that estimated the timing and number of shares that are most likely to vest. This incremental
compensation cost is being recorded over approximately four years, which is the approximate number of years that the Monte Carlo simulations predict that the Closing Market Capitalization could be reached. </P>

connection with the second tranche. The second tranche sale resulted in gross proceeds of $2.0&nbsp;million. The Company performed a final valuation of the exercised Series&nbsp;B Rights immediately prior to exercise resulting in a valuation of
approximately $6.3 million and reclassified the fair value upon extinguishment to the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock purchased in the second tranche. The combination of the $2.0 million gross cash proceeds and the $6.3&nbsp;million fair value of the
Series&nbsp;B Rights resulted in an initial fair value of the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock issued in August 2013 of $8.3 million, prior to any discounts for direct costs associated with the transaction. The resulting warrants associated with the
exercised Series&nbsp;B Rights were initially recorded at the final fair value of the Series B warrant purchase rights on the date of exercise and continued to be carried at fair value and those warrants remain outstanding as of December&nbsp;31,
2013. The unexercised Series&nbsp;B Rights for 541,309 shares of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock and the associated Series&nbsp;B Rights-Warrants expired on October&nbsp;1, 2013. As the unexercised Series B Rights and associated Series B
Rights-Warrants had intrinsic value on the date of expiration, the Company recorded a gain of $10.5 million relating to the final fair value measurement adjustment on the date of expiration. </P>
