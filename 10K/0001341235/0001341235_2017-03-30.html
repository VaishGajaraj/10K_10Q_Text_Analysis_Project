<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Occurring generally as a result of a large number of metabolic processes, aldehydes are an endogenously generated chemical species that, among other things,
promote inflammation. At high levels, aldehydes are toxic and are implicated as mediators of many inflammatory diseases. Other diseases thought to be related to aldehydes include inborn errors of metabolism, where genetic mutations lead to the
incapacity to metabolize certain toxic aldehydes. We believe that the medical needs of the patients suffering from aldehyde-mediated diseases are not currently well addressed and that there is a large market potential for therapies that can lower
aldehyde levels. In particular, current therapies for inflammatory diseases are often inadequate and may lead to toxicity, and there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically indicated for inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Allergic Conjunctivitis </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Allergic conjunctivitis is a
common allergic disease that is thought to be mediated in part by pro-inflammatory aldehydes, and is characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva, resulting in excessive ocular itching and tear production in addition to ocular swelling and
redness. Allergic conjunctivitis has been estimated to affect more than 20% of the population worldwide. The mainstay of therapy for allergic conjunctivitis is anti-histamines, which may lead to mydriasis (large pupils) and, in some patients, blurry
vision. Further, approximately one million patients in the United States do not respond to anti-histamines, especially after the acute effects of the medication subside. Many anti-histamine refractory patients are treated with corticosteroids, which
often lead to a variety of ocular toxicities that include glaucoma (a potentially blinding disease characterized by elevated intraocular pressure), cataracts (lens opacities that can lead to loss of vision), ocular infection, and ulceration. Other
ocular diseases related to allergic conjunctivitis include atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), a rare condition characterized by persistent allergic inflammation of the front of the eye. Treatment of AKC generally requires chronic corticosteroid
administration, and physicians treating AKC patients must continuously balance the severity of the disease with the toxicity of corticosteroids. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By trapping pro-inflammatory aldehydes, we believe ADX-102 may reduce inflammation in allergic conjunctivitis,
AKC, and related diseases. ADX-102 may also reduce the burden of corticosteroid use in patients with persistent disease or in patients that do not respond adequately to anti-histamines. Given the toxicity of corticosteroids, we believe that there is
a high demand for a novel topical anti-inflammatory agent to be used in conjunction with lower doses of, or in place of, corticosteroids. </P>

uveitis is an inflammatory ocular disease that is associated with elevated aldehyde levels and is characterized by severe pain, sensitivity to light, and loss of vision that can progress to blindness. The disease may occur with other autoimmune
diseases. The annual incidence of noninfectious anterior uveitis in the United States is estimated to be 150,000 patients, and approximately one-third of these patients have one or more episodes per year. The disease is typically treated with
topical corticosteroids, and many patients are at risk of developing glaucoma and cataracts as a result of corticosteroid treatment. Corticosteroids may also increase the incidence of infection and corneal ulceration. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By trapping pro-inflammatory aldehydes, we believe ADX-102 may diminish inflammation in noninfectious anterior uveitis and reduce the burden of corticosteroid

inflammatory disease that is estimated to affect five to ten percent of the population in the United States, and is characterized by insufficient moisture and lubrication of the anterior surface of the eye. Symptoms may include ocular irritation,
burning, or stinging, and severe cases may lead to loss of vision. In patients with Dry Eye Syndrome, elevated ocular levels of pro-inflammatory aldehydes are correlated with disease severity and likely contribute to persistent inflammation. Since
aldehydes covalently bind to lipids (fats) found in tears, the increased aldehyde load in Dry Eye Syndrome patients may also exacerbate insufficient ocular surface lubrication. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Until 2016, only one drug had been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Dry Eye Syndrome, and therapy for the disease is generally considered by patients
and physicians to be inadequate. Patients with severe cases of Dry Eye Syndrome may require corticosteroids. Since lowering aldehyde levels may diminish ocular inflammation and preserve tear lubricating capacity in patients with Dry Eye Syndrome,
ADX-102 and ADX-103 represent a potential novel, dual-acting therapeutic approach that could be used to augment the efficacy of currently available medications and, in severe cases, reduce or eliminate the need for corticosteroid therapy. </P>

mutations of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that converts long-chain aldehydes to fatty acids. FALDH dysfunction leads to fatty aldehyde accumulation, which is thought to result in a severe skin disorder called ichthyosis, which is
characterized by thick, scaly, flaking, itchy and inflamed skin involving much of the body surface area, as well as mental delay, spasticity, and, in some patients, retinal disorders. SLS patients are generally diagnosed as neonates given the severe
ichthyosis that presents at birth. The disease persists lifelong, and SLS patients have a shortened lifespan, often dying in the sixth decade of life. Some SLS patients are believed to inherit the disease, though most occurrences of SLS appear to be
due to sporadic mutations. The disease occurs worldwide. To our knowledge, Sweden is currently the only country to have estimated the prevalence of the disease, at 1&nbsp;per 250,000 people. Extrapolating from the Swedish estimate, it is generally
assumed that there are approximately 1,000 or fewer SLS patients in the United&nbsp;States and a larger number in Europe. The United States SLS prevalence estimate is supported by frequency analysis of FALDH missense mutations in the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute exome sequencing database. We believe that </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
many older SLS patients may be undiagnosed, potentially due to the lack of available dermatologic and genetic medicine expertise available when those patients were younger. There is no
FDA-approved treatment specifically indicated for SLS. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The primary day-to-day complaint of SLS patients and their caregivers is ichthyosis, a severe skin
disease characterized in SLS patients by thick, scaly, dry, flaking, wrinkled, pigmented, pruritic (itchy), inflamed skin. SLS patients are consistently disturbed by pruritus and often excoriate skin by scratching. The scales that accumulate on the
surface of the skin are subject to bacterial overgrowth, which results in an unpleasant odor that is associated with some SLS patients. The ichthyosis in SLS affects most of the body, generally sparing only the face, palms, and soles, and
considerable social stigma and emotional burden is common, especially given scale odor, the flaking skin, and the misconception that patients suffer from diffuse cutaneous infectious disease. There is currently no specific therapy approved for the
treatment of the dermatologic disease in SLS, though some patients and their caregivers apply non-specific topical creams, including keratinolytics (acids that soften skin), moisturizers, and retinoids. We believe that the effects of keratinolytic
and moisturizing creams are minimal or non-existent in treating severe ichthyosis, and due to toxicity, retinoids are not suitable for chronic use. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
dermatologic disease in SLS is thought to be caused by aldehyde-mediated modification of lipids (fats) that are generated in the epidermis (the most superficial layer of skin) to form a moisture barrier that holds water in the skin. Moisture barrier
compromise leads to water loss, which in turn leads to epidermal thickening characteristic of ichthyosis. We believe that by lowering levels of aldehydes and thereby preventing lipid modification and the ensuing moisture barrier dysfunction,
ADX-102, when applied topically to the skin, has the potential to ameliorate the dermatologic symptoms of SLS. Further, by reducing aldehyde load throughout the body, we believe the systemic administration of ADX-102, ADX-104, or other aldehyde
traps may be beneficial in the treatment of the neurological and ocular symptoms of SLS. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Succinic Semi-Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SSADH Deficiency is a neurological disease caused by mutations in succinic semi-aldehyde dehydrogenase that result in elevated levels of succinic
semi-aldehyde, a toxic aldehyde that is converted into gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and other metabolites that lead to severe neurological dysfunction, including cognitive delay, seizures, and motor disease. Over 400 patients with SSADH Deficiency
have been identified worldwide, though the precise prevalence of the disease is not known. GHB (also known as sodium oxybate, a drug marketed for psychiatric disorders) and possibly other succinic semi-aldehyde metabolites lead to depression of
neurological function, and some patients with a diagnosis of autism have been found to have SSADH Deficiency. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There is currently no FDA-approved therapy
specifically indicated for SSADH Deficiency, and most patients are treated supportively with anti-epileptic medications. While several therapeutic approaches have been attempted in clinical trials, and one medication is currently undergoing testing
in a clinical trial run by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to our knowledge, none have shown promise in addressing the core toxicity of succinic semi-aldehyde, and patients are generally poorly responsive to these
approaches. By trapping succinic semi-aldehyde, ADX-102, ADX-104, or other systemically administered aldehyde traps may have the potential to reduce the direct toxicity of succinic semi-aldehyde as well as the formation of neurotoxic metabolites,
and represent a novel approach with considerable therapeutic potential in a disease where there remains significant unmet medical need. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>A New

in the inflammatory response. In addition, aldehyde binding to cellular constituents leads to the formation of adducts and aggregates that may lead to cellular dysfunction. Because of the inherent toxicity of aldehydes, most, if not all, living
organisms contain enzymes such as aldehyde dehydrogenases that detoxify aldehydes. The toxicity of aldehydes is evidenced by human studies showing an increased rate of cognitive decline, cancer, and cardiovascular disease in populations with
diminished aldehyde dehydrogenase capacity. Additionally, most inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, and cardiovascular diseases, manifest elevated aldehyde levels that apparently overwhelm endogenous
aldehyde catabolic capacity. To our knowledge, there has never been a concerted pharmaceutical effort to lower all free aldehyde levels. Thus, we believe that aldehyde sequestration represents a novel platform for the treatment of inflammatory
conditions and inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism where genetic mutations prevent the normal degradation of aldehydes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Aside from increasing levels of
inflammation, there is no generally accepted biological role of high levels of aldehydes. Some physiologic molecules have aldehyde forms, including retinaldehyde (a form of Vitamin A) and pyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate (forms of Vitamin B6), but
these molecules are not free aldehydes in that they are tightly chaperoned and protected by proteins that prevent the aldehydes from reacting with other molecules, including aldehyde traps. Thus, pharmacotherapeutic aldehyde sequestration is
expected<I> a priori</I> not to adversely affect normal physiologic processes. Consistent with the toxicity of free aldehydes and the lack of accessibility to chaperoned physiologic aldehydes, our most advanced aldehyde trap, ADX-102, which has been
administered to over 100 subjects across four clinical trials, has been generally well tolerated and has not resulted in any serious adverse events. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Aldehyde Traps </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are currently developing ADX-102, a
new chemical entity, for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. ADX-102 is a small molecule designed specifically to trap, and thereby allow for the degradation of, aldehydes. In<I> in vitro</I> and animal
studies, ADX-102 appears to have minimal pharmacology, meaning that ADX-102 does not appear to affect most cellular components, including most receptors, enzymes, ion channels, or other proteins. ADX-102 has been shown to bind and trap aldehydes
more rapidly than aldehydes bind any cellular constituent. Evidence suggests that ADX-102 covalently binds to aldehydes to form ADX-102-aldehyde adducts, which appear to be rapidly degraded in cellular environments, after which neither ADX-102 or
free aldehydes are detectable. Outside of biological systems, ADX-102-aldehyde adducts are remarkably non-reactive and stable, suggesting that ADX-102-aldehyde binding is effectively irreversible; hence the notion of ADX-102 as an aldehyde trap. By
essentially irreversibly binding aldehydes to form covalent adducts that are then degraded, ADX-102 and other aldehyde traps have the potential to substantially lower aldehyde levels. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe we have been the first to demonstrate the positive effects of lowering aldehyde levels with an aldehyde trap in a variety of animal models relating
to inflammation, suggesting that aldehyde traps may have potent anti-inflammatory effects that persist hours after ADX-102 administration at a variety of different doses relevant to clinical testing. In addition, we believe we have also been the
first to demonstrate the activity of ADX-102 in binding aldehydes in <I>in vitro</I> and preclinical models of inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

novel aldehyde traps and we intend to continue to develop intellectual property around such molecules. We have identified, synthesized, and tested numerous molecules that may be more potent than ADX-102 in trapping aldehydes. We are currently
screening novel traps for product candidates to address diseases where topical and systemic administration are applicable to reduce aldehyde-mediated pathology. We have nominated two new aldehyde traps, ADX-103 and ADX-104, for clinical development,
which may begin 2018, depending on additional preclinical data, regulatory discussions, funding, and other factors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Clinical Development </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to assess the efficacy of aldehyde trapping in human disease, in 2015 we initiated a series of clinical trials in patients with ocular inflammatory
disease and in patients with SLS, an inborn error of aldehyde metabolism. Our initial clinical trials in inflammation involved ocular testing, in part, due to the ability to non-invasively assess inflammation on the surface of and within the eye and
the ability to treat the eye with topical administration of drug. Our initial clinical trial in inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism focused on SLS, in part, because the dermatologic aspects of the disease may respond to topical administration of
drug, and assessment of dermatological response can be performed with relatively non-invasive techniques and clinical examination. Most inflammatory diseases and inborn errors of aldehyde metabolism, involve at least some tissues that cannot be
effectively treated topically, and thus we are developing systemic formulations of aldehyde traps, including ADX-102 and ADX-104. We plan to initiate Phase 1 clinical testing of a systemic formulation in the first half of 2018. </P>

patients with allergic conjunctivitis. Using the conjunctival allergen provocation test (CAPT), one hundred healthy men and women with at least a two-year history of allergic conjunctivitis to grass, tree, or ragweed pollen were randomized in equal
groups for treatment with topical ocular ADX-102 or vehicle, and ocular inflammation was induced by exposure to allergen. The clinical endpoints in the trial included patient assessment (on a 0 to 3 point scale) of ocular itching and tearing, two
prominent inflammation-related symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. In February 2016, we announced that the results demonstrated statistically significant activity of ADX-102 over vehicle in reducing ocular itching and tearing after a single dose
(see figure below). Relative to baseline scores, ADX-102 demonstrated durable efficacy that persisted across substantially all time points over three hours following CAPT challenges. Despite a stronger than expected vehicle effect, peak changes in
ocular itching and tearing scores were statistically superior to vehicle. The reductions from baseline scores were of the same magnitude previously observed in the CAPT model with existing therapies utilized in the treatment of allergic
conjunctivitis. ADX-102 was generally well tolerated and there were no safety concerns during the trial. Transient and generally mild stinging was noted in the treatment arm. Two patients dropped out of the trial during treatment. </P>

continue to seek to develop and commercialize ADX-102 or our other product candidates for certain diseases in the United States alone or with corporate partners. If approved by regulatory agencies for marketing, our current expectation is that
ADX-102 or our other product candidates would initially be sold by us to small groups of physicians that specialize in rare disorders or severe disease. We may also plan to utilize strategic partners or contract sales forces to assist in the
commercialization of ADX-102 or our other product candidates for common diseases, and with such partners, would seek to build awareness in the approved patient populations of the clinical utility of ADX-102 and our other product candidates. </P>

facilities for the production of ADX-102 or our other product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required
raw materials, drug substance and finished drug product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We have no immediate plans to purchase, erect or otherwise create any manufacturing facilities to be owned by us for any of these purposes, and
intend to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of ADX-102 or our other product candidates. If ADX-102 or
our other product candidates are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers for the commercial production at such time. We may utilize third-party consultants to manage our
manufacturing contractors. We believe that the active pharmaceutical ingredient and other materials needed for the formulation of ADX-102, ADX-103, and ADX-104 are relatively easy to manufacture, and that multiple suppliers and formulators could be
employed for this purpose. Further, the raw materials needed for manufacture of ADX-102, ADX-103 and ADX-104, as well as other components of our formulations, are generally readily available from multiple sources. </P>

published on the idea of reducing aldehyde levels, primarily by using compounds with primary amines (certain nitrogen-containing compounds) that react with aldehydes through a well-known chemical process known as the Schiff base reaction. The Schiff
base reaction is reversible, and generally the substrates (precursors) and products of the reaction exist in equilibrium such that at any point in time, the aldehyde substrate may be bound or unbound. In this way, Schiff base reactions alone
represent reversible and </P>

temporary aldehyde binding. Various aldehyde-binding amines have been described, particularly carnosine (a naturally occurring dipeptide), which has a variety of additional potential mechanisms
of action unrelated to aldehydes. At least one group has published on the use of certain nitrogen-containing marketed products to temporarily, in a reversible manner, bind retinaldehyde as a potential therapy for retinal disease. We believe that
ADX-102 and other novel aldehyde traps that we have discovered are differentiated from the above approaches in that the chemical structures are novel and the reaction with aldehydes is essentially irreversible<I> in vivo</I>, which we believe may
result in a more effective means of diminishing aldehyde levels. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Other Pharmacotherapies </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and lead to the commercial success of our
product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, and the ability to reduce the dependence on, or the dose of, more toxic products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many of our
potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of
products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for products and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors&#146; products may be more
effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product that we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product
candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. In addition, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could
render our products non-competitive or obsolete. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect that, if approved, ADX-102 and or our other product candidates, will compete with a variety of

approved therapy for SSADH Deficiency. We believe that anti-epileptics and other medications used in SSADH Deficiency are inadequate in controlling the symptoms of the disease. While ADX-102 and other novel aldehyde traps may manifest efficacy and
safety advantages over currently available therapies, many such therapies are generic or may be priced considerably lower than the pricing we anticipate for our product candidates. Pricing factors may discourage the initial or prolonged use of

requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, manufacturing and control procedures and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the toxicity and
other safety characteristics of the product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some
preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30&nbsp;days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions and places the clinical
trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Even if the IND becomes effective and the trial proceeds without initial FDA objection, the FDA may stop the trial at
a later time if it has concerns, such as if unacceptable safety risks arise. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, an independent IRB, covering each site proposing to
conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor
may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB&#146;s requirements, or may impose other
conditions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to
request a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. If such an agreement
is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record, and it will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed unless the sponsor fails to follow the agreed-upon protocol, data supporting the request are found to be false or
incomplete, or the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. Even if an SPA is agreed to, approval of the NDA is not guaranteed because
a final determination that an agreed-upon protocol satisfies a specific objective, such as the demonstration of efficacy, or supports an approval decision, will be based on a complete review of all the data in the NDA. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is defined
as one affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals where there is no reasonable expectation that the product development cost will be recovered from product sales in the United States. Orphan drug
designation must be requested before submitting an NDA and does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If an orphan drug-designated product subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it was designed, the product will
be entitled to seven years of product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. If a competitor obtains
approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease, the competitor&#146;s exclusivity could block the approval of our
product candidate in the designated orphan indication for seven years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For some products, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and
mitigation strategy (REMS) which could include measures imposed by the FDA such as prescribing restrictions, requirements for post-marketing studies or certain restrictions on distribution and use. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is
additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether
the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#146;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this
event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act
(PDUFA), the FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe. A Priority
Review designation is given to products that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The goal for completing a Priority Review is six months. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is likely that our product candidates will be granted a Standard Review. The review process
may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or obtain clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present
difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory
committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. In addition, for combination products, the FDA&#146;s review may include the participation of both the FDA&#146;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the
FDA&#146;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, which may complicate or prolong the review. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Before approving an NDA, the FDA may
inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After the FDA evaluates the NDA and, in some cases, the related manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete
Response Letter (CRL) to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or
information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the
deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after
the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to
prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA
approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms, such as a Black Box Warning, which highlights a
specific warning (typically life-threatening), or a REMS program. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a company may be required to submit and
obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require such company to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. </P>

an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to product/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution,
advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities
involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with
cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose
reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP
compliance. </P>

Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use
the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA
determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health
care providers of the drug&#146;s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy
at 18&nbsp;months, three years, and seven years after the strategy&#146;s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure

eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for
patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term
restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an
approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any
patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of
clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of
certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not
previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug
application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted
after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other
than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year
exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the
submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate
safety and effectiveness. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Manufacturing Requirements </I></B></P>

candidates, test such formulations in preclinical studies for toxicology, safety and efficacy and to conduct clinical trials for each product candidate. We anticipate funding clinical trials for our product candidates ourselves, but we may engage
collaboration partners at certain stages of clinical development. As we obtain results from clinical trials, we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates or programs in order to focus our resources on more
promising product candidates or programs. Completion of clinical trials by us or our future collaborators may take several years or more, the length of time generally varying with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product

efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from
contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Generally, these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price. Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of
patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones. Expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol. If timelines or
contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had total stockholders&#146; equity of $21.6 million and an accumulated deficit of $77.3 million. Losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our clinical trials, research and development programs and from our
general and administrative expenses. In the future, we intend to continue to conduct research and development, clinical testing, regulatory compliance activities and, if ADX-102 or any of our other product candidates is approved, sales and marketing
activities that, together with anticipated general and administrative expenses, will likely result in our incurring further significant losses for the next several years. </P>

candidates, raise capital, expand our business, or continue our operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not
always predictive of future results. Any product candidate we or any of our future development partners advance into clinical trials, including <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ADX-102,</FONT> may not have favorable results in later clinical trials,
if any, or receive regulatory approval. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Drug development has inherent risk. We or any of our future development partners will be
required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile, for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for
their commercial sale. Drug development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage of development, including after commencement of any of our clinical trials. In addition, as product candidates proceed
through development, the trial designs may often be different from phase to phase, the vehicles or controls may be modified from trial to trial and the product formulations or manufacturing process may differ due to the need to test product
candidate samples that can be manufactured on a commercial scale. For instance, we plan to modify the control utilized in our expected Phase 2b allergic conjunctivitis trial from the control used in our prior Phase 2a trial. Success in early
clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing.
Furthermore, our clinical trials will need to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy for approval by regulatory authorities in larger patient populations. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after
earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. In addition, only a small percentage of drugs under development result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the presumed mechanisms of aldehyde-mediated inflammation are distinct from the presumed aldehyde-mediated pathology in inborn
errors of metabolism, and the efficacy and safety of ADX-102 or our other product candidates in one indication does not predict the safety and efficacy of ADX-102 and our other product candidates in other indications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Because we are developing novel product candidates for the treatment of diseases in a manner which there is little clinical drug development experience
and, in some cases, are using new endpoints or methodologies, the regulatory pathways for approval are not well defined, and, as a result, there is greater risk that our clinical trials will not result in our desired outcomes. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our clinical focus is on the development of new products for inflammation, inborn errors of metabolism, and other diseases that are thought to
be related to naturally occurring toxic and pro-inflammatory chemical species known as aldehydes. Our planned Phase 3 vehicle-controlled clinical program in noninfectious anterior uveitis and our planned Phase 3 clinical program in SLS represent the
first such clinical trials performed, and thus the comparative effects of vehicle and drug are unpredictable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We could also face
challenges in designing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval of aldehyde sequestering agents due to the small number of historical clinical trial experience for this novel class of therapeutics. Because no aldehyde sequestering agents
have received regulatory approval anywhere in the world, it is difficult to determine whether regulatory agencies will be receptive to the approval of our product candidates and to predict the time and cost associated with obtaining regulatory
approval. The clinical trial requirements of the FDA and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and
intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied classes of product
candidates. Any inability to design clinical trials with protocols and endpoints acceptable to applicable regulatory authorities, and to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, would have an adverse impact on our business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our product candidates are, to our knowledge, new chemical entities, and unexpected problems related to such new technology may arise that can
cause us to delay, suspend or terminate our development efforts. Although we have seen signs of efficacy and observed ADX-102 to be well tolerated in our clinical trials to date, because ADX-102 is a novel chemical entity with limited use in humans,
short and long-term safety, as well as prospects for efficacy, are poorly understood and difficult to predict due to our and regulatory agencies&#146; lack of experience with them. Regulatory approval of new product candidates such as ADX-102 can be
more expensive and take longer than approval for other more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical product candidates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our dermatologic topical formulation of ADX-102 is unlikely to affect other clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren-Larsson Syndrome, which may decrease
the likelihood of regulatory and commercial acceptance. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the primary day-to-day complaint of SLS patients and their caregivers are symptoms
associated with severe skin disease, SLS patients also manifest varying degrees of delay in mental development, spasticity, seizures and retinal disease. In August 2016, we announced that the results of our randomized, parallel-group, double-masked,
vehicle-controlled clinical trial of a dermatologic formulation of ADX-102 for the treatment of the skin manifestations of SLS demonstrated clinically relevant activity of ADX-102 in diminishing the severity of ichthyosis, a serious dermatologic
disease characteristic of SLS. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of these trials. However, due to expected low systemic exposure of ADX-102 when administered topically to the skin, it is unlikely that ADX-102 will significantly
affect the non-dermatologic conditions of SLS. Lack of effect in neurologic and ocular manifestations of SLS may negatively impact regulatory discussions with the FDA and may also negatively impact reimbursement, pricing and commercial acceptance of
ADX-102, if it is approved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>ADX-102 and our other product candidates are subject to extensive regulation, compliance with which is costly and time
consuming, and such regulation may cause unanticipated delays, or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing, and distribution
of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market our product candidates until we receive regulatory
approval from the FDA. The process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive, often takes many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the products involved, as well as the target indications, and
patient population. Approval policies or regulations may change and the FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time
and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ADX-102 and our other

product candidate from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of the applicable product candidate to the
payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Further, we cannot be
sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our product candidates. If reimbursement is not available or is available only in limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our product candidates
profitably, or at all, even if approved. In recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions, the federal government has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the Medicare program. Comprehensive reforms to the U.S.
healthcare system were recently enacted, including changes to the methods for, and amounts of, Medicare reimbursement. The new presidential administration and Congress have indicated they may further reform the Medicare program and the U.S.
healthcare system, but have not made any definitive proposals which allow us to gauge the impact of such potential reforms, if any, on our business and operations. These reforms could significantly reduce payments from Medicare and Medicaid over the
next ten years. Reforms or other changes to these payment systems, including modifications to the conditions on qualification for payment, bundling of payments or the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers, may change the
availability, methods and rates of reimbursements from Medicare, private insurers and other third-party payers for our current and future product candidates, if any, for which we are able to obtain regulatory approval. Some of these changes and
proposed changes could result in reduced reimbursement rates for such product candidates, if approved, which would adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results. </P>

attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may also refuse to provide coverage of approved product candidates for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has
granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs. We expect to
experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative proposals as well as country,
regional or local healthcare budget limitations. </P>

and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the
marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the United States Congress of the FDA&#146;s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more
stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, the Medical Modernization Act of 2003
(MMA) changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In
addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formulas where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal
coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved
products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any
reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In early 2010,
President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, PPACA), a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or
constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and imposed additional health
policy reforms. Effective October&nbsp;1, 2010, the PPACA&#146;s definition of &#147;average manufacturer price&#148; was revised for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, beginning in 2011,
the PPACA imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with
healthcare practitioners. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the PPACA on our business, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under Medicare, and may also increase our regulatory
burdens and operating costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">More recently, the new presidential administration and the U.S. Congress have indicated they may seek to

restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws
include false claims statutes and anti-kickback statutes. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the
federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or
receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs.
This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formula managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe
harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they
do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over the past few years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged
promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then
used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to
reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several
states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer&#146;s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. </P>

one or more foreign jurisdictions, we will be subject to rules and regulations in those jurisdictions relating to our product candidates. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is
subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. If reimbursement of our future products is

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including budget and funding levels, ability to hire and
retain key personnel, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development
activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ability of the FDA and other government agencies to
properly administer their functions is highly dependent on the levels of government funding and the ability to fill key leadership appointments, among various factors. Currently, the FDA Commissioner position is vacant, pending the appointment of a

STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">st</SUP> Century Cures Act is designed to streamline the agency&#146;s hiring process and enable the FDA to compete for leadership talent by expanding the narrow ranges that are provided in the existing

have on the FDA and on programs such as the 21<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">st</SUP> Century Cures Act. Furthermore, future government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits may include reduced allocations to the FDA
and other related government agencies. These budgetary pressures may result in a reduced ability by the FDA to perform their respective roles; including the related impact to academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is fully or
partially dependent on both the level and timing of funding from government sources. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time

pharmaceutical ingredient are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. While we have issued
composition-of-matter patents in the United States and other countries for ADX-102, we cannot be certain that the claims in our patent applications covering composition-of-matter of our other product candidates will be considered patentable by the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in our issued composition-of-matter patents will not be found invalid
or unenforceable if challenged. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication
that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products &#147;off-label.&#148; Although off-label prescriptions may
infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. In addition, there are possibly methods that can be employed to trap aldehydes that we have not

Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone
connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO, even outside the context of litigation. The
outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were
unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product candidate. Such a loss of patent protection

Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example,
failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be
less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our

our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical
patents is costly, time consuming, and inherently uncertain. In addition, Congress may pass patent reform legislation. The Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in
certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect
to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain

countries, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on ADX-102 and our other product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States
can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to
prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our
technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that

offset the Section&nbsp;382 of the Code limitation generated by such ownership changes. Any future ownership changes, including those resulting from our recent or future financing activities, may cause our existing tax attributes to have additional

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally
equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with
respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock. The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require
that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i)&nbsp;the
purchaser&#146;s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii)&nbsp;a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii)&nbsp;a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure
requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We
currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our loan and security
agreement with Pacific Western currently prohibits us from paying dividends on our equity securities, and any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our
common stock. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no
guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares. </P>

stock. Substantially all of our outstanding common stock are eligible for sale as are common stock issuable under vested and exercisable stock options. If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or the public
market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that
we deem appropriate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging
growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are
not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could
be an emerging growth company until December&nbsp;31, 2019, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if we become a large accelerated filer, if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any
fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December&nbsp;31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three year period before that time, we would
cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a &#147;smaller reporting company&#148; which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions
from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports
and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market
for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are incurring significant increased costs and demands upon management as a result of operating as a
public company. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a
private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, annual,
quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC, and The NASDAQ Capital Market to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in
these areas such as &#147;say on pay&#148; and proxy access. Recent legislation permits smaller &#147;emerging growth companies&#148; to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from our Initial Public Offering.
We intend to continue to take advantage of this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses. Stockholder activism, the
current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in
which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect the rules and regulations applicable to public companies
to continue to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or
increase the prices of our products or services. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to
maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and
retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If we fail to maintain proper and
effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors&#146; views of us and, as a result, the value of
our common stock. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to report upon the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. When and if we are a &#147;large accelerated filer&#148; or an &#147;accelerated filer&#148; and are no longer an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; each as defined in the Exchange
Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of
certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of
Section&nbsp;404. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting
firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation,
testing, and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we need to upgrade our systems including information technology; implement additional financial and management controls,
reporting systems, and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. </P>

appropriate level of technical accounting experience and training necessary or adequate formally documented accounting policies and procedures to support, effective internal controls. As we grow, we will hire additional personnel and engage in
external temporary resources and may implement, document and modify policies and procedures to maintain effective internal controls. However, we may identify deficiencies and weaknesses or fail to remediate previously identified deficiencies in our
internal controls. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected or unremediated, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future, could cause us to fail to
meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our common stock to decline. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If securities or industry analysts do not publish
research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us,
our business, our market or our competitors. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If other securities or industry analysts do not commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be
negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock
could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We could be subject to securities class action litigation.
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price
of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
management&#146;s attention and resources, which could harm our business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of
activist stockholders. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Proxy contests have been waged against many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, over the last few
years. We may be particularly vulnerable to these actions due to the highly concentrated ownership of our common stock. If faced with a proxy contest or other type of shareholder activism, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or
dispute, which would be disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by a proxy contest or shareholder dispute involving us or our partners because: </P>

solution in patients with noninfectious anterior uveitis demonstrated that ADX-102 reduced inflammatory cell count in the anterior chamber of the eye to a degree similar to that of standard-of-care corticosteroid therapy (which may lead to cataracts

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Stock-based compensation expense represents the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards and stock option grants, which are being recognized over the
requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. For stock option grants with performance-based milestones, the expense is recorded over the remaining service period after
the point when the achievement of the milestone is probable or the performance condition has been achieved. We generally estimate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. If vesting is based on market-based
milestones, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the timing and number of shares that are most likely to vest and record the expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the milestone will be achieved. We account for stock
options to non-employees using the fair value approach. Stock options to non-employees are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
generally estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a)&nbsp;the risk-free interest rate,
(b)&nbsp;the expected volatility of our stock, (c)&nbsp;the expected term of the award and (d)&nbsp;the expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of sufficient historical public market trading activity, we have based our estimate of expected
volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, we have selected companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the
industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. We compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies&#146; shares over approximately
the expected life of the options. The resulting volatility estimate was approximately 89%, and we have employed this value throughout our calculations. We have also computed the historical volatility of ALDX historical information regarding the
volatility of our own stock price and have determined that a volatility estimate of 89% is reasonable. We have estimated the expected life of our employee stock options using the &#147;simplified&#148; method, whereby, the expected life equals the
average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option for service-based awards. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the yields of zero-coupon United States Treasury
securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of employee stock option grants in

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.&nbsp;2016-15 (ASU&nbsp;2016-15), Statement of Cash
Flows. The standard is intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. ASU&nbsp;2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, with early
adoption permitted. ASU&nbsp;2016-15 may be adopted retrospectively or prospectively if it is impractical to apply the amendments retrospectively. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instrument-Credit Losses (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or a group of financial
assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net
carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. ASU&nbsp;2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2019. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its financial

guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a
number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. ASU&nbsp;2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its financial

depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature,

related to our clinical trials and general working capital purposes. The term loans are to be made available to us upon the following terms: (i)&nbsp;$2.0&nbsp;million was made available in November 2014 (which was used in part to refinance then
outstanding loans from Pacific Western); and (ii) $3.0&nbsp;million (the Tranche B Loan) became available to the Company in 2016 following the satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of positive phase 2 data in noninfectious anterior
uveitis. Any term loan made is payable as interest-only prior to November 2017 and thereafter is scheduled to be payable in monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest through the maturity date in October 2020. Each term loan accrues
interest from its date of issue at a variable annual interest rate equal to the greater of 2.0% plus prime or 5.25%&nbsp;per annum. The annualized interest rate as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 was 5.60%. The Credit Facility is collateralized by our
assets, including our intellectual property. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, $1.4 million was outstanding under the Credit Facility. At December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Credit Facility is shown net of a remaining debt discount of $79,663 which is being

compared to net cash used in operating activities of $9.3 million in 2015. The primary use of cash was to fund our operations. The increase in the amount of cash used in operating activities for 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to an increase in
both research and development and general and administrative expenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Investing Activities</I>. Net cash used in investing activities
in 2016 were $(225,234) related primarily to the purchase of marketable securities partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities compared to net cash used in investing activities in 2015 of $13.0 million related primarily to the
purchase of marketable securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Financing Activities</I>. Net cash provided by financing activities was $12.7 million for the year

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we entered into a lease agreement for a certain commercial office space. The thirty-seven month lease
which began in September 2014 provides us with approximately 3,700 square feet of space in Lexington, Massachusetts. Base annual rent is initially set at $5,604 per month. Total base rent payable over the lease period is approximately $205,000. In
March 2016, we entered into a sublease for approximately 3,188 additional square feet of office space to expand our headquarters in Lexington, Massachusetts. The sublease expires in September 2017. The sublease provides for the payment of annual
base rent in the amount of $67,000 payable in monthly installments and the requirement to pay certain operating expenses, taxes and other fees in accordance with the terms of the master lease. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our long-term debt obligation consists of amounts we are obligated to repay under our Credit Facility with Pacific Western, of which $1.4 million was
outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. We entered into the Credit Facility in April 2012 and it has been subsequently amended to make term loans in a principal amount of up to $5,000,000 available to us with proceeds to be used first to refinance
outstanding loans from Pacific Western, second to fund expenses related to our clinical trials, and the remainder for general working capital purposes. The term loans are to be made available to us upon the following terms: (i)&nbsp;$2,000,000 was
made available on November&nbsp;10, 2014; and (ii)&nbsp;$3.0 million (the Tranche B Loan) which was made available to the Company in May 2016 following the satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of positive phase 2 data in
noninfectious anterior uveitis. Each term loan accrues interest from its date of issue at a variable annual interest rate equal to the greater of 2.0% plus prime or 5.25%&nbsp;per annum. In November 2016, we amended our Credit Facility such that any
term loan we draw is payable as interest-only prior to November 2017 and thereafter is payable in monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest over 36 months. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December&nbsp;31,
2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December&nbsp;31, 2016: </P>

disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, such as this annual report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed to
ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our
quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an evaluation of some components of our internal control over financial reporting. We also perform a separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of
providing the management report below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design, our implementation of
the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this annual report on Form&nbsp;10-K. In the course of the controls evaluation, we reviewed data errors or control problems identified and sought to confirm that
appropriate corrective actions, including process improvements, were being undertaken. This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief
Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of our evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them
as necessary. We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes and procedures that we adjust as circumstances merit. </P>

under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our management utilized the criteria established in the Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. Based on the assessment, our management has concluded that, as of
December&nbsp;31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>

in the state of Delaware on August&nbsp;13, 2004 as Neuron Systems, Inc. On December&nbsp;20, 2012, the Company changed its name to Aldexa Therapeutics, Inc. and, on March&nbsp;17, 2014, the Company changed its name to Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. The
Company is a biotechnology company focused primarily on the development of new products for inflammation, inborn errors of metabolism and other diseases that are thought to be related to endogenously generated toxic and pro-inflammatory chemical
species known as aldehydes. The ongoing research and development activities will be subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States. Prior to marketing in the United States, any drug developed by the Company
must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The Company has limited experience in
conducting and managing the preclinical and clinical testing necessary to obtain regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that the Company will not encounter problems in the clinical trials that will cause the Company or the FDA to delay or
suspend clinical trials. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain patents and product license rights,
maintain trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the property rights of others, both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that patents issued to or licensed by the Company will not be challenged, invalidated,
circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

closed its Initial Public Offering, in which 1,500,000 shares of common stock were sold at a price to the public of $8.00 per share for an aggregate offering price of $12.0 million. The offer and sale of all of the shares in the Initial Public
Offering were registered under the Securities Act of the 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No.&nbsp;333-193204), which was declared effective by the SEC on May&nbsp;1, 2014. The Company raised approximately
$10.0 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $0.8 million, $1.0 million in prepaid offering and printing costs and other offering costs of $0.2 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;15, 2015, the Company sold, in a private placement, an aggregate of approximately 1.1&nbsp;million shares of common stock at a

a net-exercise feature. The warrants may be redeemed by the Company at a price of $0.001 per share upon notice to the holders in the event that the closing bid for Aldeyra&#146;s common stock for each of the fifteen consecutive trading days prior to
such redemption is at least $20.00 per share and the average trading volume of Aldeyra&#146;s common stock during such period is 50,000 shares per day. Following Aldeyra&#146;s notification to the warrant holders of its exercise of the redemption
right under the warrants, each warrant holder will have the option to exercise their warrants prior to the redemption date rather than having them redeemed. The Company raised approximately $7.1 million in net proceeds in the private placement of
common stock and warrants. </P>

211,528 shares of common stock at a price of $9.33 per share and a warrant to purchase up to 211,528 shares of common stock at a price of $0.125 per share subject to the warrant. The exercise price of the warrant is $9.50 per share. The warrant will
expire 3 years from the date of issuance. The warrant does not include a net-exercise feature. The warrant may be redeemed by the Company at a price of $0.001 per share upon notice to the holder thereof in the event that the closing bid for
Aldeyra&#146;s common stock for each of the fifteen consecutive trading days prior to such redemption is at least $20.00 per share and the average trading volume of Aldeyra&#146;s common stock during such period is 50,000 shares per day. Following
Aldeyra&#146;s notification to the warrant holder of its exercise of the redemption right under the warrant, the warrant holder will have the option to exercise the warrant prior to the redemption date rather than having it redeemed. The Company
raised approximately $1.9 million in net proceeds in the private placement of common stock and a warrant to purchase common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On
May&nbsp;22, 2015, the Company raised approximately $19.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, through the issuance and sale of 2,822,500 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering,
including shares sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
June&nbsp;2016, the Company closed an underwritten public offering in which the Company sold, an aggregate of 2,760,000&nbsp;shares of common stock, including 360,000 shares sold in connection with the exercise in full by the underwriter of its
option to purchase additional shares. The net proceeds of the offering, including the full exercise of the option, were approximately&nbsp;$12.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the other offering expenses
payable by the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2017, the Company closed an underwritten public offering in which we sold, 2,555,555 shares of its
common stock, including 333,333 shares sold in connection with the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. The net proceeds of the offering, including the full exercise of the option, were approximately
$10.5 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the other estimated offering expenses payable by Aldeyra. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition, as discussed in Note 7, the Company entered into its credit facility (the Credit Facility) in April 2012 and it has been subsequently amended to make term loans in a principal amount of up to $5,000,000 available to the Company with
proceeds to be used first to refinance outstanding loans from Pacific Western, second to fund expenses related to the Company&#146;s clinical trials, and the remainder for general working capital purposes. The term loans are to be made available to
the Company upon the following terms: (i)&nbsp;$2,000,000 was made available on November&nbsp;10, 2014; and (ii)&nbsp;$3.0 million (the Tranche B Loan) which was made available to the Company in May 2016 following the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including receipt of positive phase 2 data in noninfectious anterior uveitis. Each term loan accrues interest from its date of issue at a variable annual interest rate equal to the greater of 2.0% plus prime or 5.25%&nbsp;per annum. In
November 2016, the Company amended its Credit Facility such that any term loan the Company may draw is payable as interest-only prior to November 2017 and thereafter is payable in monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest over 36
months. The Credit Facility is collateralized by the Company&#146;s assets, including its intellectual property. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s
management believes that its currently available resources, including the funds from the February 2017 public offering and amounts available under the Credit Facility, will provide sufficient funds to enable the Company to meet its obligations into
at least the third quarter of 2018 based on its current business plan. The Company will need to raise additional capital to implement its near-term business plan. Additional funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all.
If the Company is unable to secure additional capital, or meet financial covenants that could be implemented under the Company&#146;s term loans in certain circumstances, it will be required to significantly decrease the amount of planned
expenditures, and may be required to cease operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Curtailment of operations would cause significant delays in the Company&#146;s
efforts to introduce its products to market, which is critical to the realization of its business plan and the future operations of the Company. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Use of Estimates</I></B> &#150; The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
US&nbsp;GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. The most significant estimates in the Company&#146;s financial statements relate to accruals, including research and development costs,
accounting for income taxes and the related valuation allowance and accounting for stock based compensation and the related fair value. Although these estimates are based on the Company&#146;s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake
in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and assumptions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Segment Information
</I></B>&#150; Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources
and in assessing performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business in one segment, which is the identification and development of a treatment for diseases related to high levels of aldehydes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cash and Cash Equivalents</I></B> &#150; The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of greater than three months but less than 12 months as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial
institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs), government securities and obligations, and money market funds. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">RRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of &#145;Government Securities and Obligations&#146; for an amount not less than 102% of their
value. The Company does not record an asset or liability related to the collateral as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit
rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with original maturities of greater than three months are
classified as marketable securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Marketable Securities </I></B>&#150; Marketable securities consist of government securities and
obligations with original maturities of more than 90 days. Investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive
income/(loss). Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. </P>

Taxes</I>, in reporting deferred income taxes. ASC 740 requires a company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for expected future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company&#146;s financial statements.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in the years in which the temporary
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions pursuant to ASC 740 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for
financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. If the tax position meets this threshold, the benefit to be recognized is measured as the tax benefit having the highest likelihood of being
realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in the provision for income taxes. Management is not aware of any uncertain tax positions. </P>

Statement of Cash Flows. The standard is intended to reduce the diversity in practice around how certain transactions are classified within the statement of cash flows. ASU&nbsp;2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15,
2017, with early adoption permitted. ASU&nbsp;2016-15 may be adopted retrospectively or prospectively if it is impractical to apply the amendments retrospectively. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its financial
statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instrument-Credit Losses (ASU 2016-13). ASU&nbsp;2016-13 requires a
financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of
the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. ASU&nbsp;2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2019. The Company does not expect this standard
to have a material impact on its financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-09 Improvements to Employee

right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess
the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.

ASU 2016-01 amends the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although ASU 2016-01 retains many current requirements, it significantly revises accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments
in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. ASU 2016-01 also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments and is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements. </P>

offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in ASU 2015-17. ASU&nbsp;2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on

term loans in a principal amount of up to $5,000,000 available to the Company with proceeds to be used first to refinance outstanding loans from Pacific Western, second to fund expenses related to its clinical trials, and the remainder for general
working capital purposes. The term loans are to be made available upon the following terms: (i)&nbsp;$2,000,000 was made available on November&nbsp;10, 2014; and (ii)&nbsp;$3.0 million (the Tranche B Loan) which was made available to the Company in
May 2016 following the satisfaction of certain conditions, including receipt of positive phase 2 data in noninfectious anterior uveitis. Each term loan accrues interest from its date of issue at a variable annual interest rate equal to the greater
of 2.0% plus prime or 5.25%&nbsp;per annum. In November 2016, we amended our Credit Facility such that any term loan the Company draws is payable as interest-only prior to November 2017 and thereafter is payable in monthly installments of principal

driven by no tax benefit being recorded on the current year loss from operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under Section&nbsp;382 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (Code), a corporation that undergoes an &#147;ownership change&#148; is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (NOLs) and certain other tax assets (tax attributes) to offset future
taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders&#146; lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally
three years). Transactions involving the Company&#146;s common stock, even those outside the Company&#146;s control, such as purchases or sales by investors, within the testing period could result in an ownership change. A limitation on the
Company&#146;s ability to utilize some or all of its NOLs or credits could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and cash flows. Prior to 2016, Aldeyra underwent two ownership changes and it is possible that
additional ownership changes have occurred since. However, the Company&#146;s management believes that it has sufficient &#147;Built-In-Gain&#148; to offset the Section&nbsp;382 of the Code limitation generated by such ownership changes. Any future
ownership changes, including those resulting from the Company&#146;s recent or future financing activities, may cause the Company&#146;s existing tax attributes to have additional limitations. </P>

2016 following the approval of the Company&#146;s stockholders. The 2016 ESPP authorizes the initial issuance of up to a total of 97,500 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock to participating employees. The number of shares reserved for issuance
under the 2016 ESPP automatically increases on the first business day of each fiscal year, commencing in 2017, by a number equal to the lesser of (i)&nbsp;1% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last business day of the prior fiscal
year; or (ii)&nbsp;the number of shares determined by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. Unless otherwise determined by the administrator of the 2016 ESPP, two offering periods of six months&#146; duration will begin each year on January&nbsp;1
and July&nbsp;1. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, there was no activity under the 2016 ESPP. On January&nbsp;1, 2017, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2016 ESPP was automatically increased by 125,763 shares, increasing the number
of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2016 ESPP to 223,263. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

placement, an aggregate of approximately 1.1&nbsp;million shares of common stock at a price of $7.00 per share. Investors received warrants to purchase up to approximately 1.1&nbsp;million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $9.50. The
Company raised approximately $7.1 million in net proceeds in the private placement of common stock and warrants. Additionally, on January&nbsp;21, 2015, in a subsequent private placement, the Company sold an aggregate of 211,528 shares of common
stock at a price of $9.33 per share and a warrant to purchase up to 211,528 shares of common stock at a price of $0.125 per share subject to the warrant. The Company raised approximately $1.9 million in net proceeds in the private placement of
common stock and a warrant to purchase common stock. In both transactions, the exercise price of the warrants is $9.50 per share. The warrants will expire 3 years from their respective date of issuance. The warrants do not include a net-exercise
feature. The warrants may be redeemed by the Company at a price of $0.001 per share upon notice to the holders thereof in the event that the closing bid for Aldeyra&#146;s common stock for each of the fifteen consecutive trading days prior to such
redemption is at least $20.00 per share and the average trading volume of Aldeyra&#146;s common stock during such period is at least 50,000 shares per day. Following Aldeyra&#146;s notification to the warrant holders of its exercise of the
redemption right under the warrants, the warrant holders will have the option to exercise the warrants prior to the redemption date rather than having them redeemed. </P>

for approximately 3,188 additional square feet of office space to expand its headquarters in Lexington, Massachusetts. The sublease expires in September 2017. The sublease provides for the payment of annual base rent in the amount of $67,000 payable
