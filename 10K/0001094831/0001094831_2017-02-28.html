<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The voice brokerage business within our Financial Services segment originates from one of the oldest and most established inter-dealer &#150;or
wholesale brokerage franchises in the financial intermediary industry. Cantor started our wholesale intermediary brokerage operations in 1972. In 1996, Cantor launched its eSpeed system, which revolutionized the way government bonds are traded in
the inter-dealer market by providing a fully electronic trading marketplace. eSpeed, Inc. (&#147;eSpeed&#148;) completed an initial public offering in 1999 and began trading on NASDAQ, yet it remained one of Cantor&#146;s controlled subsidiaries.
Following eSpeed&#146;s initial public offering, Cantor continued to operate its inter-dealer voice brokerage business separately from eSpeed. In August 2004, Cantor announced the reorganization and separation of its inter-dealer voice brokerage
business into a subsidiary called &#147;BGC,&#148; in honor of B. Gerald Cantor, the pioneer in screen brokerage services and fixed income market data products. In April 2008, BGC and certain other Cantor assets merged with and into eSpeed, and the
combined company began operating under the name &#147;BGC Partners, Inc.&#148; In June 2013, BGC sold certain assets relating to its U.S. Treasury benchmark business and the name &#147;eSpeed&#148; to Nasdaq, Inc. (&#147;Nasdaq,&#148; formerly known
as &#147;NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.) (see &#147;Nasdaq Transaction&#148;). </P>

recognized as one of the leading full-service wholesale financial brokers in the world, with a rich history of developing innovative technological and financial solutions. After September&nbsp;11, 2001 and the loss of the majority of our U.S.-based

employment agreement that provides him with certain cash and equity compensation. Pursuant to the TO Agreement, BGC has established a Distributable Earnings Bonus Pool (the &#147;Pool&#148;) program in an amount equal to one times the average annual
distributable earnings (as defined) of the GFI inter-dealer brokerage business for the three successive <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">12-month</FONT> periods beginning on July&nbsp;1, 2015. The Pool is in the form of awards of restricted equity

the former members of the GFI Special Committee, BGC; and certain other former officers and affiliates of GFI entered into a memorandum of understanding (the &#147;MOU&#148;) with regard to a preliminary settlement (the &#147;Settlement&#148;) of
the consolidated class action case pending against GFI in the State of Delaware (the &#147;Consolidated Delaware Action&#148;). Neither GFI nor BGC contributed any funds to the Settlement, which will be paid from a combination of insurance proceeds
and payments by JPI and Messrs. Gooch and Heffron. The Settlement provides for a settlement fund of $10.75&nbsp;million for the class of GFI stockholders in the Consolidated Delaware Action and payment of attorneys&#146; fees and costs to
plaintiffs&#146; counsel in an amount to be established by negotiation, mediation or a fee application to the Court. The final Settlement will also require approval of the Court. In connection with the Settlement, on October&nbsp;6, 2015, we
advanced $10.75&nbsp;million to JPI in return for a promissory note (the &#147;JPI Note&#148;). The JPI Note bore interest at the rate of 5.375%&nbsp;per annum and was secured by two&nbsp;million shares of GFI common stock owned by JPI. The JPI Note
was repaid on the date of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Back-End</FONT> Mergers. In the MOU, the CME agreed to terminate the restriction prohibiting former executive officers of GFI, JPI and certain other stockholders and affiliates of GFI
from supporting the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Back-End</FONT> Mergers. In connection with the Settlement, Messrs. Gooch and Heffron, JPI, BGC and GFI entered into a separate agreement providing for certain matters relating to the merger of

Merger, a subsidiary of BGC merged with and into GFI pursuant to a short-form merger under Delaware law, with GFI continuing as the surviving entity. The JPI Merger allowed BGC to acquire the remaining approximately 33% of the outstanding shares of

held by JPI, less the principal plus accrued interest on the $10.75&nbsp;million note issued by JPI to BGC on October&nbsp;6, 2015, divided by (b)&nbsp;the number of outstanding shares of New JPI common stock. This amount was paid 30&nbsp;percent in
cash and 70&nbsp;percent in shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock, valued at a price of $9.46 per share of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock, which was the closing price of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock on the day prior to the date of the TO

of the $250.0&nbsp;million note previously issued to GFI by BGC, which is eliminated in consolidation.&nbsp;This figure excludes the $29.0&nbsp;million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2015 with respect to the appreciation of the

their real estate capital concerns on every real estate product type. We offer a broad range of services, including investment sales, mortgage and entity level equity financing, and valuation and appraisal services. We recently expanded our real
estate capital markets capabilities through the strategic addition of many prolific, accomplished capital markets brokers in key markets throughout the United States. In the multifamily sector, through our ARA brand, we operate one of the largest
full-service investment brokerage operations in the United States focused exclusively on multifamily investment sales. Our real estate capital markets business has grown at a compounded annual rate of 71% during the 24 months ended December&nbsp;31,
2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have access to the world&#146;s largest owners of real estate, and this will drive growth throughout the life cycle of each real
estate asset by allowing us to provide <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">best-in-class</FONT></FONT> agency leasing and property management during the ownership period. We also provide investment sales and debt and
equity financing to assist owners in maximizing the return on investment in each of their real estate assets. We have also begun a dramatic expansion of our valuation and appraisal business from which we expect to see significant growth,
particularly in conjunction with our increasingly robust capital markets platform. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since 2011, our Real Estate Services revenues have
increased by nearly 350%. Approximately two thirds of this growth was from acquisitions and the remaining amount was attributable to expansion of our prior existing business. This growth can be attributed to our commitment to developing long-term
relationships with our clients, our strategic approach to developing and deploying technology, and expansion of our various product lines. In the past five years, NGKF has acquired over 30 companies, including leading brokerage firms in such dynamic
markets as San Francisco/Silicon Valley, Denver, Philadelphia, Houston, Dallas and Atlanta. Outside of the United States, we recently acquired a full service real estate firm in Mexico City, one of the world&#146;s largest markets. In addition, we
have concentrated on expanding our service offerings through targeted hiring and acquisitions in key service lines. Recent areas of focus include capital markets, retail brokerage, consulting, appraisal and valuation and multifamily housing. To
complement and drive future growth opportunities within our GCS business, we are leveraging our capabilities in providing innovative <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">front-end</FONT> real estate technology solutions to cross sell other corporate
services to those clients, including leasing services, project management, facilities management and lease administration services. Through our Excess Space brand, we focus our business model on disposition, lease restructuring and lease renewal
services for retailers nationwide, and the formation of our National Retail Advisory Group represents millions of square feet for lifestyle brands and lifestyle retail centers across the country. </P>

costs for clients through analyzing, structuring and negotiating business and economic incentives. Fees are generally earned when a lease is signed and/or the tenant takes occupancy of the space. In many cases, landlords are responsible for paying
the fees.<B><I> </I></B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Agency Leasing. </I></B>We execute marketing and leasing programs on behalf of investors, developers,

total revenue that the landlord is expected to derive from the lease over its term. In certain markets revenue is determined on a per square foot basis. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we represent buildings that total 371&nbsp;million square feet on

advertising in trade and business publications to develop and market our brand. We believe that our emphasis on our unique capabilities and specialty groups, such as Capital Markets, Office, Retail, Industrial, Healthcare, Hospitality and GCS,
enables us to demonstrate our strengths and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. These multi-market business groups provide customized collateral, website and technology solutions that address specific client needs. </P>

our sales professionals with the market knowledge we believe is necessary to educate and advise clients, and also to bring properties to market quickly and effectively. These tools and templates include proprietary research and analyses, <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">web-based</FONT> marketing systems and ongoing communications and training about our depth and breadth of services. Our sales professionals use these local and national resources to participate directly in selling to,
advising and servicing clients. We provide marketing services and materials to certain independently owned offices as part of an overall agreement allowing them to use our branding. We also benefit from shared referrals and materials from local
offices. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, we invest in and rely on comprehensive research to support and guide the development of real estate and investment

prospective clients and the marketplace through the company website. We believe that our investments in research and technology are critical to establishing our brand as a thought leader and expert in real estate-related matters and provide a key

combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We own numerous domain names and have registered numerous trademarks
and/or service marks in the United States and foreign countries. Our trademark registrations must be renewed periodically, and in most jurisdictions, every ten years </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have adopted a comprehensive intellectual property program to protect our proprietary technology and innovations. We currently have
licenses covering various patents from related parties. We also have agreements to license technology that may be covered by several pending and/or issued U.S. patent applications relating to various aspects of our electronic trading systems,
including both functional and design aspects. We have filed a number of patent applications to further protect our proprietary technology and innovations, and have received patents for some of those applications. We will continue to file additional
patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate, demonstrating our commitment to technology and innovation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our patent portfolio

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit risk arises from potential <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-performance</FONT> by counterparties and customers. We have established
policies and procedures to manage our exposure to credit risk. We maintain a thorough credit approval process to limit exposure to counterparty risk and employ stringent monitoring to control the counterparty risk from our matched principal and
agency businesses. Our account opening and counterparty approval process includes verification of key customer identification, anti-money laundering verification checks and a credit review of financial and operating data. The credit review process
includes establishing an internal credit rating and any other information deemed necessary to make an informed credit decision, which may include correspondence, due diligence calls and a visit to the entity&#146;s premises, as necessary. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit approval is granted subject to certain trading limits and may be subject to additional conditions, such as the receipt of collateral or
other credit support. Ongoing credit monitoring procedures include reviewing periodic financial statements and publicly available information on the client and collecting data from credit rating agencies, where available, to assess the ongoing
financial condition of the client. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Principal Transaction Risk </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through our subsidiaries, we execute matched principal transactions in which we act as a &#147;middleman&#148; by serving as counterparty to
both a buyer and a seller in matching <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">back-to-back</FONT></FONT> trades. These transactions are then settled through a recognized settlement system or third-party clearing
organization. Settlement typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. We generally avoid settlement of
principal transactions on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">free-of-payment</FONT></FONT> basis or by physical delivery of the underlying instrument. However, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">free-of-payment</FONT></FONT> transactions may occur on a very limited basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The number of matched principal
trades we execute has continued to grow as compared to prior years. Receivables from broker-dealers and clearing organizations and payables to broker-dealers and clearing organizations on our consolidated statements of financial condition primarily
represent the simultaneous purchase and sale of the securities associated with those matched principal transactions that have not settled as of their stated settlement dates. Our experience has been that substantially all of these transactions
ultimately settle at the contracted amounts. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Market Risk </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses
for a specified position. In our Financial Services business, we may allow certain of our desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are
primarily for the purpose of managing proprietary positions, facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, we may have market risk exposure on these transactions. Our
exposure varies based on the size of our overall positions, the risk characteristics of the instruments held and the amount of time the positions are held before they are disposed of. We have limited ability to track our exposure to market risk and
unmatched positions on an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">intra-day</FONT> basis; however, we attempt to mitigate market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging our exposure. These positions are
intended to be held short term to facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, we may not be able to unwind the position and we may be forced
to hold the position for a longer period than anticipated. All positions held longer than <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">intra-day</FONT> are marked to market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have investments in marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and which had a fair value of $164.8&nbsp;million as of
December&nbsp;31, 2016. These include the shares of common stock of NASDAQ that we received in exchange for a portion of our electronic benchmark Treasury platform and the shares of the common stock of ICE that we received in exchange for Trayport.
Investments in marketable securities carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that the marketable securities will not lose value and, in general, securities markets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result of these different market
risks, our holdings of marketable securities could be materially and adversely affected. We seek to minimize the effect of price changes on a portion of our investments in marketable securities through the use of derivative contracts. However, there
can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with our investments in marketable securities. See Note 10&#151;&#147;Marketable Securities&#148; and Note 12&#151;&#147;Derivatives&#148;
to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> for further information regarding these investments and related hedging activities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our risk management procedures and strict limits are designed to monitor and limit the risk of unintended loss and have been effective in the
past. However, there is no assurance that these procedures and limits will be effective at limiting unanticipated losses in the future. Adverse movements in the securities positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions
could result in a substantial loss. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for
any particular reporting period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Operational Risk </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Financial Services businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse
markets in many currencies on a daily basis. If any of our data processing systems does not operate properly or is disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer impairment to
our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially
beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our
ability to expand our businesses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, despite our contingency plans, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted
by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with
whom we conduct business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other
information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures such as software programs, firewalls and similar technology to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients&#146; information,
the nature of the threats continue to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers,
unavailability or disruption of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. There have also been an increasing number of malicious cyber incidents
in recent years in various industries, including ours. Any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties important to our businesses, could present risks to our operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Foreign Currency Risk </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are exposed to
risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency rates create volatility in the U.S. dollar equivalent of our revenues and expenses in particular with regard to British Pounds and Euros. In addition, changes in
the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated net assets are recorded as part of our results of operations and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. We monitor the net exposure in foreign currencies on a daily basis and may hedge
our exposure as deemed appropriate with highly rated major financial institutions. </P>

competition in all aspects of our businesses. In our Financial Services businesses, we compete primarily with other inter-dealer or wholesale brokers, including for brokers, salespeople, and suitable acquisition candidates. Our existing and
potential competitors are numerous and include other inter-dealer brokerage firms, multi-dealer trading companies, financial technology companies and market data and information vendors, securities and futures exchanges, electronic communications
networks, crossing systems, software companies, consortia, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">business-to-business</FONT></FONT> marketplace infrastructure companies and niche market energy and other commodity

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Financial Services segment primarily competes with three major, diversified inter-dealer and/or wholesale financial brokers. These include
NEX Group plc (&#147;NEX&#148;) (formerly known as ICAP plc), TP ICAP plc (&#147;TP ICAP&#148;) (formerly known as &#147;Tullett Prebon plc&#148;) and Compagnie Financi&egrave;re Tradition (which is majority owned by Viel&nbsp;&amp; Cie)
(&#147;Tradition&#148;), all of which are currently publicly traded companies. Other such competitors include a number of smaller, private firms that tend to specialize in specific product areas or geographies, such as Marex Spectron Group Limited
in energy and commodities and Gottex Brokers Holding SA in OTC interest rate derivatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Demand for services of
brokers is directly affected by national and international economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in and uncertainty regarding tax laws and substantial
fluctuations in the volume and price levels of securities transactions. Other significant factors affecting competition in the brokerage industry are the quality and ability of professional personnel, the depth and pricing efficiency of the markets
in which the brokers transact, the strength of the technology used to service and execute on those markets and the relative prices of products and services offered by the brokers and by competing markets and trading processes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Market Data and Financial Software Vendors </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The majority of our large inter-dealer and wholesale financial broker competitors also sell proprietary market data and information, which
competes with our market data offerings. In addition to direct sales, we resell market data through large market data and information providers. These companies have established significant presences on the vast majority of trading desks in our
industry. Some of these market data and information providers, such as Bloomberg L.P. and Thomson Reuters Corporation, include in their product mix electronic trading and execution of both OTC and listed products in addition to their traditional
market data offerings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Exchanges and Other Trading Platforms </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although our businesses will often use exchanges to execute transactions brokered in both listed and OTC markets, we believe that exchanges
have sought and will seek to migrate products traditionally traded in OTC markets by inter-dealer and/or wholesale financial brokers to exchanges. However, we believe that when a product goes from OTC to exchange-traded, the underlying or related
OTC market often continues to experience growth in line with the growth of the exchange-traded contract. In addition, ICE operates both regulated exchanges and OTC execution services, and in the latter it competes directly with inter-dealer and/or
wholesale financial brokers in energy, commodities, and credit products. ICE entered these OTC markets primarily by acquiring independent OTC brokers, and we believe that it is likely ICE or other exchange operators may seek to compete with us in
the future by acquiring other such brokers, by creating futures products designed to mimic OTC products, or through other means. </P>

and broker-dealers have in the past created and/or funded consortia to compete with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers.&nbsp;For example, NEX&#146;s inter-dealer businesses for fully electronic trading of U.S. Treasuries and spot foreign exchange
both began as dealer-owned consortia before being acquired by NEX.&nbsp;An example of a current and similar consortium is Tradeweb.&nbsp;Currently, several large banks hold stakes in Tradeweb, an Internet-based market intermediary.&nbsp;Thomson
Reuters Corporation is Tradeweb&#146;s single largest shareholder. Although Tradeweb operates primarily as a dealer to customer platform, some of its offerings include a voice and electronic inter-dealer platform and a SEF. In addition,
Tradeweb&#146;s management has said that it would like to expand into other inter-dealer markets, and as such may compete with us in other areas over time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, certain investment management firms that traditionally deal with banks and broker-dealers have expressed a desire to have direct
access to certain parts of the wholesale financial markets via firms such as ours. We believe that over time, interdealer-brokers will therefore gain a small percentage of the sales and trading market currently dominated by banks and broker-dealers.
Since their collective revenues are many times those of the global inter-dealer market, we believe that our gaining a small share of banks and broker-dealers&#146; revenues would lead to a meaningful increase in our Financial Services revenues. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Overall, we believe that we may also face future competition from market data and technology companies and some securities brokerage firms,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our partnership structure is one of the unique strengths of our business. Many of our key brokers, salespeople and other front
office professionals have their own capital invested in our business, aligning their interests with our stockholders. Limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings consist of: (i)&nbsp;&#147;founding/working partner units&#148; held by limited
partners who are employees; (ii)&nbsp;&#147;limited partnership units,&#148; which consist of a variety of units that are generally held by employees such as REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs;
(iii)&nbsp;&#147;Cantor units&#148; which are the exchangeable limited partnership interests held by Cantor entities; and (iv)&nbsp;preferred partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;), which are working partner units that may be awarded to
holders of, or contemporaneous with, the grant of REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs. For further details, see &#147;Our Organizational Structure.&#148; NPSUs are partnership units that are not entitled
to participate in partnership distributions, not allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be exchangeable into shares of our common stock. On terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion,
NPSUs are expected to be replaced by a grant of PSUs, PPSUs, LPUs or PLPUs, which may be set forth in a written schedule and subject to additional terms and conditions, provided that, in all circumstances such grant of PSUs, PPSUs, LPUs or PLPUs
shall be contingent upon our, including our affiliates, earning, in aggregate, at least $5&nbsp;million in gross revenues in the calendar quarter in which the applicable award of PSUs, PPSUs, LPUs, or PLPUs is to be granted. In addition, we have
NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs (collectively, the &#147;N Units&#148;) which are <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-distributing</FONT> partnership units that may not be allocated any item of profit or loss and may not be made
exchangeable into shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, the N Units are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e., an NREU will be converted into an REU)
and then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to us and comply
with his or her partnership obligations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our partnership structure is an effective tool in recruiting, motivating and
retaining key employees. Many brokers are attracted by the opportunity to become partners because the partnership agreement generally entitles partners to quarterly distributions of income from the partnership. While BGC Holdings limited partnership
interests generally entitle our partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our business, upon leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests as described below),
any such partners are only entitled to receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such partner&#146;s capital account or
compensatory grant awards, excluding any goodwill or going concern value of our business unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and we, as the general partner of BGC Holdings, otherwise determine. Our partners can receive the right to
exchange their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests for shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock (if, in the case of founding partners, Cantor so determines and, in the case of working partners and limited partnership unit holders, the BGC
Holdings general partner, with Cantor&#146;s consent, determines otherwise) and thereby realize any higher value associated with our Class&nbsp;A common stock. We believe that, having invested in us, partners feel a sense of responsibility for the
health and performance of our business and have a strong incentive to maximize our revenues and profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Relationship Between BGC Partners and

addition, we operate a number of platforms that are governed pursuant to SEC Regulation ATS. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have registered to do
business. In addition, Treasury rules relating to trading government securities apply to such activities when engaged in by broker-dealers. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) is the federal agency primarily responsible

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Much of the regulation of broker-dealers&#146; operations in the United States has been delegated
to self-regulatory organizations. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) that govern the operations of broker-dealers and government securities broker-dealers and conduct periodic inspections and
examinations of their operations. In the case of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, the principal self-regulatory organization is FINRA. FINRA was formed from the consolidation of the NASD&#146;s member regulation operations and the regulatory arm
of the NYSE Group to act as the self-regulatory organization for all broker-dealers doing business within the United States. Accordingly, our U.S. subsidiaries are subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the SEC and FINRA. In our
futures-related activities, our subsidiaries are also subject to the rules of the CFTC, futures exchanges of which they are members and the National Futures Association (&#147;NFA&#148;), a futures self-regulatory organization. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The changing regulatory environment, new laws that may be passed by Congress, and rules that may be promulgated by the SEC, the Treasury, the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the CFTC, the NFA, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, if adopted, may directly affect our operations and profitability and
those of our competitors and customers and of the securities markets in which we participate in a way that could adversely affect our businesses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC, self-regulatory organizations and state securities administrators conduct informal and formal investigations of possible
improprieties or illegal action by broker-dealers and their &#147;associated persons,&#148; which could be followed by the institution of administrative, civil and/or criminal proceedings against broker-dealers and/or &#147;associated persons.&#148;
Among the sanctions that may result if administrative, civil or criminal proceedings&nbsp;were ever instituted against us or our &#147;associated persons&#148; are injunctions, censure, fines, penalties, the issuance of <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">cease-and-desist</FONT></FONT> orders or suspension or expulsion from the industry and, in rare instances, even imprisonment. The principal purpose of regulating and disciplining
broker-dealers is to protect customers and the securities markets, rather than to protect broker-dealers or their creditors or equity holders. From time to time, our &#147;associated persons&#148; have been and are subject to routine investigations,
none of which to date have had a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
light of recent events in the U.S. and global financial markets, regulators and legislators in the U.S. and European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) continue to craft new laws and regulations for the global OTC derivatives markets, including the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), which became law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates or encourages several reforms regarding derivatives, including new regulations for swaps markets creating
impartiality considerations, additional <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-</FONT> and post-trade transparency requirements, and heightened collateral or capital standards, as well as recommendations for the obligatory use of central clearing for
most standardized derivatives. The law also requires that standardized OTC derivatives be traded in an open and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exclusionary</FONT> manner on a DCM or a SEF. The SEC is still in the process of finalizing rules
for the implementation of these requirements and it is anticipated that the SEC may release their rule set surrounding security-based SEFs in 2017. The actual implementation of such rules may be phased in over a longer period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As these rules require authorized execution facilities to maintain robust <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">front-end</FONT> and back-office IT
capabilities and to make large and ongoing technology investments, and because these execution facilities may be supported by a variety voice and auction-based execution methodologies, we expect our hybrid and fully electronic trading capability to
perform strongly in such an environment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, while the recently adopted Volcker Rule does not apply directly to us, the Volcker
Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be continued uncertainty regarding the Volcker Rule, its impact on various affected businesses, how those businesses will
respond to it, and the effect that it will have on the markets in which we do business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Derivative Markets, L.P. (&#147;BGC

in July 2012. EMIR fulfills several of the EU&#146;s G20 commitments to reform OTC derivatives markets. The reforms are designed to reduce systemic risk and bring more transparency to both OTC and listed derivatives markets. EMIR derivatives rules
will apply initially to financial and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-financial</FONT> firms that are counterparties to derivatives contracts in the EU and later to those trading outside the EU under certain circumstances. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first compliance obligations for EMIR came into force in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-March</FONT> 2013 with the adoption of
certain regulatory technical standards and implementing technical standards which included timely confirmations. Risk mitigation techniques for uncleared OTC derivatives became effective September&nbsp;15, 2013 and comprised ISDA portfolio
reconciliation, dispute resolution and disclosure protocol. The trade reporting for OTC derivative contracts to be reported to a Trade Repository (&#147;TR&#148;) came into effect in phases during February to August 2014. By February 2017, all OTC
derivative contracts entered into before or after August&nbsp;16, 2012 and no longer outstanding as of February&nbsp;12, 2014 are to be reported to a TR. In October 2014, the European Commission adopted its first &#147;equivalence&#148; decisions
for the regulatory regimes of central counterparties in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. The central counterparties in these third country jurisdictions will be able to obtain recognition in the EU and can therefore be used by market
participants to clear standardized OTC derivatives as required by EU legislation, while remaining subject solely to the regulation and supervision of their home jurisdiction. </P>

(&#147;REMIT&#148;) Implementation Acts became effective on January&nbsp;7, 2015. The REMIT Implementing Acts developed by the European Commission define the details of reporting under REMIT, drawing up the list of reportable contracts and
derivatives; defining details, timing and form of reporting, and establishing harmonized rules to report that information to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (&#147;ACER&#148;). They enable ACER to collect information in relation
to wholesale energy market transactions and fundamentals through the Agency&#146;s REMIT Information System (ARIS), to analyze this data to detect market abuse and to report suspicious events to the National Competent Authorities, which are
responsible for investigating these matters further, and if required, imposing sanctions. Market participants and third parties reporting on their behalf have had to: (i)&nbsp;by October&nbsp;7, 2015, report transactions executed at organized market
places and fundamental data from the central information transparency platforms; and (ii)&nbsp;by April&nbsp;7, 2016, report transactions in the remaining wholesale energy contracts (OTC standard and

(&#147;OTF&#148;) and there is currently expected to be a joint equivalence assessment by EU and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-EU</FONT> jurisdictions for granting mutual access to their respective domestic marketplaces. MiFID II may require
us to carry out internal reorganizations and possibly apply for additional licenses. In addition, the June&nbsp;23, 2016 UK referendum vote to leave the European Union and the announcement that the UK government will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon
Treaty (thereby setting in motion the timetable for the UK to leave the European Union) may impact future market structure and MiFID II rulemaking and implementation due to potential changes in mutual passporting between the UK and EU Member States.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are unable to predict how any of these new laws and proposed rules and regulations in the U.S. or the UK will be implemented or in
what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or rules and regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof or a relaxation or other amendment of existing rules and regulations, will occur in the future. Any
such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Certain enhanced regulations could subject us to the risk of fines, sanctions, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements and additional restrictions or
limitations on our ability to conduct or grow our businesses, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final
form of such new rules and regulations might take may negatively impact our customers and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact , although a relaxation of existing rules and requirements could potentially have a positive impact in
certain markets. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. We believe that it remains premature to know conclusively the specific aspects of the U.S. and EU proposals that may directly affect our businesses, as some
proposals have not yet been finalized and others which have been proposed remain subject to supervisory debate. While we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations may be positive for our businesses, it is possible that unintended
consequences of the rules and regulations may materially adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Other Financial Services Regulation

debt for clients, among other business lines, also require that we comply with regulations affecting the real estate industry and maintain licenses in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Like other market participants that operate in numerous
jurisdictions and in various business lines, market participants in our segment face corresponding greater complexity in ensuring they comply with numerous regulatory regimes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We could be required to pay fines, return commissions, have a license suspended or revoked, or be subject to criminal action should we conduct
regulated activities without a license, or without maintaining the necessary license or if we violate applicable rules and regulations. Licensing requirements could also impact our ability to engage in certain types of transactions, change the way
in which we conduct business or affect the cost of conducting business. We and our licensed associates may be subject to various due diligence, disclosure,
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">standard-of-care,</FONT></FONT> anti-money laundering and other obligations.&nbsp;We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales or other services claiming
that we did not fulfill our obligations as a service provider or broker. This could include claims with respect to alleged conflicts of interest where we act, or are perceived to be acting, for two or more clients. While management has overseen
highly regulated businesses before and expects us to comply with all applicable regulations in a satisfactory manner, no assurance can be given that it will always be the case. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, and disclosure
obligations that impact the management, development, use and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities, as well as mortgage lending availability, with respect to such properties. In our role as
property or facilities manager, we could incur liability under environmental laws for the investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes relating to properties we currently or formerly managed. Such liability may be imposed
without regard for the lawfulness of the original disposal activity, or our knowledge of, or fault for, the release or contamination. Further, liability under some of these may be joint and several, meaning that one of multiple liable parties could
be responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site. Certain requirements governing the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing materials, as well as recently enacted local ordinances obligating property or facilities managers to
inspect for and remove lead-based paint in certain buildings, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and potentially subject us to violations or claims Additionally, under certain circumstances, failure by our brokers acting as agents for
a seller or lessor to disclose environmental contamination at a property could result in liability to a buyer or lessee of an affected property. </P>

(&#147;BGCF&#148;) and Mint Brokers (&#147;Mint&#148;), are also subject to CFTC capital requirements. These requirements are designed to ensure financial soundness and liquidity by prohibiting a broker or dealer from engaging in business at a time
when it does not satisfy minimum net capital requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, net capital is essentially defined as net worth (assets
minus liabilities), plus qualifying subordinated borrowings and less certain mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from conservatively valuing certain other assets, such as a
firm&#146;s positions in securities. Among these deductions are adjustments, commonly referred to as &#147;haircuts,&#148; to the market value of securities positions to reflect the market risk of such positions prior to their liquidation or
disposition. The Uniform Net Capital Requirements also impose a minimum ratio of debt to equity, which may include qualified subordinated borrowings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulations have been adopted by the SEC that prohibit the withdrawal of equity capital of a broker-dealer, restrict the ability of a
broker-dealer to distribute or engage in any transaction with a parent company or an affiliate that results in a reduction of equity capital or to provide an unsecured loan or advance against equity capital for the direct or indirect benefit of
certain persons related to the broker-dealer (including partners and affiliates) if the broker-dealer&#146;s net capital is, or would be as a result of such withdrawal, distribution, reductions, loan or advance, below specified thresholds of excess
net capital. In addition, the SEC&#146;s regulations require certain notifications to be provided in advance of such withdrawals, distributions, reductions, loans and advances that exceed, in the aggregate, 30% of excess net capital within any <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT> period. The SEC has the authority to restrict, for up to 20 business days, such withdrawal, distribution or reduction of capital if the SEC concludes that it may be detrimental to the financial integrity of
the broker-dealer or may expose its customers or creditors to loss. Notice is required following any such withdrawal, distribution, reduction, loan or advance that exceeds, in the aggregate, 20% of excess net capital within any 30 day period. The
SEC&#146;s regulations limiting withdrawals of excess net capital do not preclude the payment to employees of &#147;reasonable compensation.&#148; </P>

Holdings, L.P., GFI Brokers Limited. GFI Securities Limited, and Sunrise Brokers LLP, which are based in the United Kingdom, are subject to capital requirements established by the FCA. The FCA applies stringent provisions with respect to capital
applicable to the operation of these firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of their activities. The provisions relating to capital and liquidity requirements enforced by the FCA have undergone significant changes in response to the
current regulatory landscape, and our UK businesses are now required to maintain significantly higher regulatory capital than they have in the past. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in
which they do business. Additionally, certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> net capital requirements. In Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC and GFI (HK) Securities
LLC are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission. BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited and GFI (HK) Brokers Ltd, are regulated by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All are subject to Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel

company, and our business is operated through two operating partnerships, BGC U.S., which holds our U.S. businesses, and BGC Global, which holds our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> businesses. The limited partnership interests of
the two operating partnerships are held by us and BGC Holdings, and the limited partnership interests of BGC Holdings are currently held by limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor. We hold the BGC Holdings general partnership
interest and the BGC Holdings special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle us to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Holdings, and serve as the general partner of BGC Holdings, which entitles us to control BGC Holdings. BGC
Holdings, in turn, holds the BGC U.S. general partnership interest and the BGC U.S. special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC U.S., and the BGC Global general
partnership interest and the BGC Global special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Global, and serves as the general partner of BGC U.S. and BGC Global, all of which
entitle BGC Holdings (and thereby us) to control each of BGC U.S. and BGC Global. BGC Holdings holds its BGC Global general partnership interest through a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, BGC Global Holdings GP Limited. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, we held directly and indirectly, through wholly owned subsidiaries, BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and
BGC Global limited partnership interests consisting of 279,717,731 units and 279,717,731 units, representing approximately 65.4% and 65.4% of the outstanding BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests,
respectively. As of that date, BGC Holdings held BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests consisting of 148,237,302 units and 148,237,302 units, representing approximately 34.6% and 34.6% of the outstanding
BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Limited partnership unit holders,
founding partners, and Cantor directly hold BGC Holdings limited partnership interests. Since BGC Holdings in turn holds BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, limited partnership unit holders, founding
partners, and Cantor indirectly have interests in BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-for-one</FONT></FONT> basis (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). Upon certain circumstances, Cantor may have the right to acquire additional Cantor units in
connection with the redemption of or grant of exchangeability to certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-exchangeable</FONT> founding partner units owned by persons who were previously Cantor partners prior to the separation. On
November&nbsp;4, 2015, the Company issued exchange rights with respect to, and Cantor purchased, in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, an aggregate of 1,775,481 exchangeable limited

aggregate consideration of $2,296,801, Cantor purchased 554,196 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate of $2,115,306 (after offset of a founding partner&#146;s $46,289 debt due to Cantor). In addition, pursuant to
the Sixth Amendment, on November&nbsp;4, 2015, Cantor purchased 1,221,285 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $4,457,436 in connection with the grant of exchangeability and exchange of 1,221,285
founding partner units. Exchangeable limited partnership units held by Cantor are exchangeable by Cantor at any time on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-for-one</FONT></FONT> basis (subject to adjustment) for
shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, there were 650,364

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;6, 2013, BGC GP, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company and the General Partner of the Company&#146;s majority-owned subsidiary,
BGC Holdings, and Cantor, the Majority in Interest Exchangeable Limited Partner of the Partnership, entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the &#147;Ninth Amendment&#148;) effective as of
July&nbsp;1, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to facilitate partner compensation and for other corporate purposes, the Ninth Amendment created new
preferred partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;), which are working partner units that may be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with the grant of, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, REUs, RPUs, AREUs, and ARPUs. These new
Preferred Units carry the same name as the underlying unit, with the insertion of an additional &#147;P&#148; to designate them as Preferred Units. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Such Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class&nbsp;A common stock and accordingly will not be included in the fully diluted
share count. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings are allocated to such Units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) of the allocation amount assigned to them based on their award price, or such other amount as
set forth in the award documentation (the &#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;), before calculation and distribution of the quarterly Partnership distribution for the remaining Partnership units. The Preferred Units will not be entitled to participate
in Partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, there were 15,197,368 such units granted and outstanding. The Ninth Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors and by the full Board. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;9, 2014, partners of BGC Holdings approved the Tenth Amendment to the Agreement of Limited
Partnership of BGC Holdings effective as of May&nbsp;9, 2014. In order to facilitate partner compensation and for other corporate purposes the Tenth Amendment created a new class of partnership units (NPSUs), which are working partner units. For
more information, see Note 14&#151;&#147;Related Party Transactions&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K.</FONT> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;5, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Cantor providing Cantor, CFGM and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold
Class&nbsp;B common stock the right to exchange from time to time, on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-to-one</FONT></FONT> basis, subject to adjustment, up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of Class&nbsp;A
common stock now owned or subsequently acquired by such Cantor entities for up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of Class&nbsp;B common stock. Such shares of Class&nbsp;B common stock, which currently can be acquired upon the exchange of
exchangeable limited partnership units owned in BGC Holdings, are already included in the Company&#146;s fully diluted share count and will not increase Cantor&#146;s current maximum potential voting power in the common equity. The exchange
agreement will enable the Cantor entities to acquire the same number of shares of Class&nbsp;B common stock that they are already entitled to acquire without having to exchange their exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. The
Company&#146;s Audit Committee and full Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to approve the exchange agreement because it will help ensure that Cantor retains its exchangeable limited
partnership units in BGC Holdings, which is the same partnership in which the Company&#146;s partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner employees. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the exchange agreement, Cantor and CFGM have the right to exchange 14,683,401 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock owned by them as of

the exchange agreement would be deducted from the aggregate number of shares of Class&nbsp;B common stock that may be issued to the Cantor entities upon exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. Accordingly, the Cantor
entities will not be entitled to receive any more shares of Class&nbsp;B common stock under this agreement than they were previously eligible to receive upon exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;4, 2015, partners of BGC Holdings approved the Eleventh Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of BGC Holdings
(the &#147;Eleventh Amendment&#148;) effective as of October&nbsp;1, 2015. In order to facilitate partner compensation and for other corporate purposes, the Eleventh Amendment created five new classes of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-distributing</FONT> partnership units. These new N Units carry the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional &#147;N&#148; to designate them as the N Unit type and are designated as
NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs. The N Units are not entitled to participate in Partnership distributions, will not be allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, certain N Units may be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e. an NREU will be converted into an REU) and will then participate in Partnership distributions,
subject to terms and conditions determined by the general partner of BGC Holdings in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. The
Eleventh Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and by the full Board of Directors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;14,
2016, partners of BGC Holdings approved the Twelfth Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of BGC Holdings (the &#147;Twelfth Amendment&#148;), effective as of October&nbsp;1, 2016. The Twelfth Amendment was entered into to amend certain
terms and conditions of the N Units in order to provide flexibility to the Company and the Partnership in using such N Units in connection with compensation arrangements and practices. The Twelfth Amendment provides for a minimum $5&nbsp;million
gross revenue requirement in a given quarter as a condition for an N Unit to be replaced by another type of Partnership unit in accordance with the Partnership Agreement and the award documentation. The Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company. </P>

economy and financial and commercial real estate markets generally. Difficult market and economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our businesses. Such conditions
and uncertainties include fluctuating levels of economic output, interest and inflation rates, employment levels, consumer confidence levels, and fiscal and monetary policy. Economic policies of the new administration and Congress, potential
increases in interest rates and proposed tax cuts and infrastructure spending plans may change the regulatory and economic landscape. These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global markets that may have a
positive or negative effect on our operating results, including the levels of trading, investing, and origination activity in the securities and derivatives markets, the valuations of financial instruments, unexpected changes in interest rates,
changes in and uncertainty regarding tax laws and substantial fluctuations in volume and commissions on securities and derivatives transactions, the absolute and relative level of currency rates, commercial real estate values in absolute terms and
relative to other investing options, the volume of real estate transactions, and the actual and the perceived quality of issuers, borrowers and investors. For example, the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and international central banking
authorities directly impact our cost of funds and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, changes in monetary policy may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic and international monetary policy
are beyond our control and difficult to predict. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On a consolidated basis, for the twelve months ended December&nbsp;31, 2016,
approximately 58% of our total revenues were generated by our Financial Services segment and 41% of our total revenues were generated by our Real Estate Services segment, with 1% generated within the corporate category. As a result, our revenues and
profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of low trading volume in the financial markets in which we offer our products and services and may be similarly impacted by downturns in the commercial real estate markets. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Low transaction volumes for any of our brokerage asset classes generally result in reduced revenues. Under these conditions, our
profitability is adversely affected since many of our costs are fixed. In addition, although less common, some of our financial services or commercial real estate transaction revenues are determined on the basis of the value of transactions or on
spreads. For these reasons, substantial decreases in trading volume, declining prices, and/or reduced spreads could have material adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any downgrades of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one or more of the major credit rating agencies could have material adverse effects on
financial and commercial real estate markets and economic conditions in the U.S. and throughout the world. This in turn could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Because of the
unprecedented nature of any negative credit rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the ultimate impacts on global markets and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects are unpredictable and may
not be immediately apparent. Additionally, the negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from further sovereign debt matters with respect to the EU and/or its member states, Japan, or other major economies could adversely affect our
businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Concerns about the sovereign debt of certain major economies have caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally, and continued uncertainties loom over the
outcome the various governments&#146; financial support programs and the possibility that EU member states or other major economies may experience similar financial troubles. Any downgrades of the long-term sovereign credit rating of the U.S. or
additional sovereign debt crises in major economies could cause disruption and volatility of financial markets globally and have material adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over the past year, concerns over slowing growth in China, the longer term declines in world-wide commodities prices relative to their 2008
and 2011 highs, especially for oil, and unusual changes in volatility in various securities and derivatives markets have led to uncertainties about the stability of financial markets and the likely responses of governments and central banks. Any one
of these factors, or others, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>

consequences of such a vote, and the possible exit of the UK, together with what may be protracted negotiations around the terms of any exit could significantly impact the business environment in which we and our customers and counterparties
operate, introduce significant new uncertainties in financial markets, and create significant uncertainties with respect to legal and regulatory requirements and environments to which we and our customers and counterparties are subject. The UK vote
to leave the E.U. has already generated some market volatility, along with a significant drop in the value of the British pound. Although market volatility generally benefits our Financial Services businesses, additional market and/or currency
volatility or a reduction in trading in certain products may adversely impact customer and investor confidence. The UK vote to leave the E.U. may result in similar referendums or votes in other E.U. countries in which we do business. Further, the
lack of precedent means that it is unclear how UK businesses&#146; access to the E.U. Single Market and how the wider trading, legal and regulatory environments would be impacted, and hence how this could affect our businesses or those of our
customers and counterparties over the medium to long term. Although we continue to have regulated entities and offices in place in many of the major European markets, during a transitional period &#151; when the terms of the UK exit will be
negotiated, and beyond &#151; these and other risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our customers, and counterparties, businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. </P>

continued availability of suitable transactional candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these transactions. Future transactions
and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include payment of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">break-up</FONT> fees, assumption of liabilities, including compensation, severance and lease
termination costs, and transaction and deferred financing costs, among others. In addition, there can be no assurance that such transactions will be accretive or generate favorable operating margins. The success of these transactions will also be

effectively. The integration and additional growth may place a significant strain upon our management, administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control and compliance infrastructure. Our ability to grow depends upon our ability to
successfully hire, train, supervise and manage additional employees, expand our operational, financial reporting, compliance and other control systems effectively, allocate our human resources optimally, maintain clear lines of communication between
our transactional and management functions and our finance and accounting functions, and manage the pressure on our management, administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control and compliance infrastructure. Additionally, managing
future growth may be difficult due to our new geographic locations, markets and business lines, including the anticipated entry into the insurance brokerage business pursuant to a recent acquisition agreement. As a result of these risks and
challenges, we may not realize the full benefits that we anticipate from strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or new hires. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we
will face as we integrate and continue to expand our operations, and we may not be able to manage growth effectively or to achieve growth at all. Any failure to manage the integration of acquisitions and future growth effectively could have a

authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to a parent holding company, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may
need to meet our obligations. Certain debt and security agreements entered into by our subsidiaries contain various restrictions, including restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us and the transfer by our subsidiaries of assets pledged as
collateral. To the extent that we need funds to pay dividends, repay indebtedness and meet other expenses, or to pay taxes on our share of BGC U.S.&#146;s and BGC Global&#146;s net taxable income, and either BGC U.S. or BGC Global or their

a significant increase in the level of our indebtedness. On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring 100&nbsp;percent of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares. In December 2014, we issued our 5.375% Senior Notes in anticipation
of the tender offer which initiated such acquisition. As part of the GFI acquisition, we assumed $240.0&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount of GFI 8.375% Senior Notes due July 2018, and $60.0&nbsp;million in short-term borrowings related to a
GFI credit facility, which has since been repaid. In addition, on March&nbsp;13, 2015, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $28.2&nbsp;million under which we pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs
interest at a fixed rate of 3.70% and matures on April&nbsp;1, 2019. On May&nbsp;27, 2016, we issued an aggregate of $300&nbsp;million principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2021. Partially offsetting these increases to our indebtedness, on
April&nbsp;13, 2015, our $150.0&nbsp;million of 8.75% Convertible Senior Notes, due April&nbsp;15, 2015, were fully converted into approximately 24.0&nbsp;million shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, which were issued to Cantor. Additionally, on
July&nbsp;13, 2016, certain holders of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016 (the &#147;4.5% Convertible Notes&#148;) converted $68.0&nbsp;thousand in principal amount of notes in exchange for 6,909 shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and on
July&nbsp;15, 2016, we repaid the remaining approximately $159.9&nbsp;million principal amount of the 4.5% Convertible Notes. Further, in December 2015 we completed the sale of our Trayport business in exchange for 2,527,658 shares of
Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (&#147;ICE&#148;) common stock, of which 2,459,737 shares have been sold as of February&nbsp;24, 2017. We may also enter into other short- or long-term financing arrangements in connection with similar acquisitions
which may occur from time to time. In addition, in connection with the GFI acquisition, we incurred substantial <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-recurring</FONT> transaction costs, including <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">break-up</FONT> fees,
assumption of liabilities and expenses, and compensation expenses and we would likely incur similar expenses in connection with other acquisitions.&nbsp;The increased level of our consolidated indebtedness in connection with the GFI acquisition or
other potential acquisitions may restrict our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms, and such leverage, and any resulting liquidity or credit issues, could have a material adverse effect our businesses, financial condition, results

fires, hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, political instability, labor strikes or turmoil or terrorist attacks. For example, during 2012, our own operations and properties we manage for clients in the northeastern United States, and in particular
New York City, were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, in some cases significantly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These disruptions may occur, for example, as a result of
events affecting only the buildings in which we operate (such as fires), or as a result of events with a broader impact on the communities where those buildings are located. If a disruption occurs in one location and persons in that location are
unable to communicate with or travel to or work from other locations, our ability to service and interact with our customers and others may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communications or
travel. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Such events can result in significant injuries and loss of life, which could result in material financial liabilities, loss of
business and reputational harm. They can also impact the availability and/or loss of commercial insurance policies, both for our own businesses and for those customers whose properties we manage and who may purchase their insurance through the
insurance buying programs we make available to them. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There can be no assurance that the disaster recovery and crisis management

availability of the Internet (including &#147;cloud&#148; technology) and mobile phone technology, so the disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation. Although we maintain insurance for
liability, property damage and business interruption, subject to deductibles and various exceptions, no assurance can be given that our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will not be materially negatively affected

time to time) dedicate only a portion of their professional efforts to our businesses and operations, and there is no contractual obligation for them to spend a specific amount of their time with us and/or Cantor. These two key employees may not be
able to dedicate adequate time to our businesses and operations, and we could experience an adverse effect on our operations due to the demands placed on our management team by their other professional obligations. In addition, these key

employment by Cantor is not subject to these provisions in the BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement, from resigning or competing against us. In addition, our success in the Financial Services segment has largely been dependent on the efforts
of Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick and our President, Shaun Lynn, and other executive officers. In the Real Estate Services segment, our success has similarly been dependent on efforts by Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick in connection with acquisitions and on an ongoing basis by
officers such as Barry Gosin and other key employees, including some who have been hired in connection with these acquisitions. Should Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick leave or otherwise become unavailable to render services to us, control of us would likely pass
to Cantor, and indirectly pass to the then-controlling stockholder of CFGM (which is Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick), Cantor&#146;s managing general partner, or to such other managing general partner as CFGM would appoint, and as a result control could remain
with Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick. If any of our key employees in our Financial Services or Real Estate Services segments were to join an existing competitor, form a competing company, offer services to Cantor that compete with our services or otherwise leave
us, some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor or another competitor instead of our services, which could adversely affect our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial

faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal controls.
Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As

achieve in such a way as to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable internal control, financial reporting, and legal and regulatory requirements. Any failures to ensure full compliance with internal control and financial reporting

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and concentration of market share
among companies in the banking, financial brokerage, exchange, and financial services industries, resulting in increasingly large existing and potential competitors, and increased concentration in markets dominated by some of our largest customers.
In addition, some of our large broker-dealer customers, such as Deutsche Bank, Barclays, and Credit Suisse have announced plans to further reduce their sales and trading businesses in fixed income, currency, and commodities. This is in addition to
the drastic reductions in these businesses already completed by customers, including Morgan Stanley, UBS, and The Royal Bank of Scotland. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The combination of this consolidation and concentration of market share and the reduction by large customers of certain businesses may lead
to increased concentration among our broker-dealer customers, which may reduce our ability to negotiate pricing and other matters with our customers and lower volumes. Additionally, the sales and trading global revenue market share has become
increasingly concentrated over the past five years among five of the top investment banks across equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities asset classes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also face existing and potential competition from large exchanges, which seek or may seek to migrate trading from the inter-dealer market
to their own. Consolidation and concentration of market share are occurring in this area as well. For example, in recent years, BATS Global Markets acquired the foreign-exchange trading venue, Hotspot from KCG Holdings, while BATS itself announced
plans to be acquired by CBOE. In addition, Deutsche Bourse and LSE Group announced their intention to merge; the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited acquired the London Metal Exchange; and ICE completed the acquisition of NYSE Euronext.
Consolidation among exchanges may increase their financial resources and ability to compete with us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Continued consolidation and
concentration of market share in the financial services industry and especially among our customers could lead to the exertion of additional pricing pressure by our customers, impacting the commissions and spreads we generate from our brokerage
services. Further, the consolidation and concentration among exchanges, and expansion by these exchanges into derivative and other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-equity</FONT> trading markets, will increase competition for customer trades and
place additional pricing pressure on commissions and spreads. These developments have increased competition from firms with potentially greater access to capital resources than we have. Finally, consolidation among our competitors other than
exchange firms could result in increased resources and product or service offerings for our competitors. If we are not able to compete successfully in the future, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be
materially adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Actions taken by central banks in major global economies may have a material negative impact on our
businesses. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, policies undertaken by certain central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central
Bank, and the Bank of England, have involved quantitative easing or the buying and selling of currencies in the foreign exchange market. Quantitative easing involves open market transactions by monetary authorities to stimulate economic activity
through the purchase of assets of longer maturity and has the effect of lowering interest rates further out on the yield curve. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For
example, as of January&nbsp;1, 2017, the U.S. Federal Reserve held approximately $3.7 trillion worth of long-dated U.S. Treasury and Federal Agency securities which are not being traded or hedged. This compares to $1.7 trillion at the beginning of
2011 and zero prior to September 2008. This has reduced volatility and volumes for listed and OTC interest rate products in the U.S. Although the Federal Reserve has ceased purchases, it continues to hold substantially all of the securities
purchased. In addition, despite the recent increase in interest rates, the Federal Reserve may continue to use traditional methods to keep short-term interest rates low by historical standards. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Recently, central banks in other jurisdictions, including the EU, Japan and China, have undertaken quantitative easing and other steps aimed
at reducing interest rates and stimulating their economies through monetary policy. In these jurisdictions also, interest rates are expected to remain low by historical standards for some time to come. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, global FX volumes were muted over various periods during the past several years, largely because certain major central banks, such
as those in Japan and China, intervened to keep global currencies from appreciating, and because low interest rates (themselves partially a result of quantitative easing) in most major economies make carry-trade strategies less appealing for FX
market participants. In addition, increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions are likely to result in increased holdings of government securities, which holdings will be less likely to be traded or hedged, thus reducing
further transaction volumes in those securities. Since the new capital requirements make it more expensive for the banks and other financial institutions to hold assets other than government securities, the new requirements may also reduce their
trading and hedging activities in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. Moreover, many of our large bank customers have faced increasing regulatory scrutiny of their rates
and FX businesses, and this may negatively impact industry volumes. These central banking policies may materially adversely affect our businesses, particularly our rates and FX operations. </P>

October&nbsp;2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on January&nbsp;22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced
in February 2014 for &#147;made available to trade&#148; products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. We also own ELX, a
CFTC-approved DCM. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we believe that BGC Derivative Markets, GFI Swaps Exchange and ELX are in compliance with applicable rules, no assurance can
be given that this will always be the case, that the market for these products will not be less robust, that there may accordingly be less volume and liquidity in these markets, that there may be less demand for our services or the market in general
or that the industry will not experience disruptions as customers or market participants transition to the rules associated with the Dodd-Frank Act. While we continue to have a compliance framework in place to comply with both existing and proposed
rules and regulations, including any potential relaxation of rules and regulations, our businesses in these products could be significantly reduced and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially
adversely affected by applicable regulations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Even after the award of permanent registration status to our SEFs, we will incur

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Dodd-Frank Act mandated that certain cleared swaps (subject to an exemption from the clearing requirement) trade on either a DCM or SEF.
SEF and DCM core principles relate to trading and product requirements, compliance and audit-trail obligations, governance and disciplinary requirements, operational capabilities, surveillance obligations and financial information and resource
requirements. While these principles may or may not be permanently enforced, we do know that we will be subject to a more complex regulatory framework going forward, and that there will be significant costs to prepare for and to comply with these
ongoing regulatory requirements and potential amendments. We will incur increased legal fees, personnel expenses and other costs, as we work to analyze and implement the necessary legal structure for full compliance with all applicable regulations.
There will also be significant costs related to the development, operation and enhancement of our technology relating to trade execution, trade reporting, surveillance, compliance and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">back-up</FONT> and disaster
recovery plans designed to meet the requirements of the regulators. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, it is not clear at this point what the impact of these
rules and regulations will be on the markets in which we currently provide our SEF services. During the continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules, the markets for cleared and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cleared</FONT>
swaps may continue to be less robust, there may be less volume and liquidity in these markets and there may be less demand for our services. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain banks and other institutions may continue to be limited in their conduct of proprietary trading and may be further limited from
trading in certain derivatives. The new rules, including the proprietary trading restrictions for certain banks and other institutions, could materially impact transaction volumes and liquidity in these markets and our businesses, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely impacted as a result. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we fail to continue to qualify as
a SEF under any of these conditions, we may be unable to maintain our position as a provider of execution and brokerage services in the markets for many of the OTC products for which we have traditionally acted as an intermediary. This would have a
broad impact on us and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results operations and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our commodities derivatives activities, including those related to electricity, natural gas and environmental interests, subject us to

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We engage in the brokerage of commodities derivatives, including those involving electric power and natural gas, and related products and

significant costs and liabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We or our clients may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and
regulations relating to our commodities-related activities, including trading of electricity, natural gas, and environmental interests. New regulation of OTC derivatives markets in the U.S. and similar legislation proposed or adopted abroad will
impose significant new costs and new requirements on the commodities derivatives activities of us and our customers. Therefore, the overall reputation of us or our clients may be adversely affected by the current or future regulatory environment.

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The financial services industry in which we operate is subject to significant regulation. We are subject to regulatory capital
requirements on our regulated businesses, and a significant operating loss or any extraordinary charge against capital could materially adversely affect our ability to expand or, depending upon the magnitude of the loss or charge, even to maintain
the current level of our businesses. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many aspects of our businesses, like those of other financial intermediary firms, are subject
to significant capital requirements. In the U.S., the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the NFA and various other regulatory bodies have stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the
nature and extent of these entities&#146; activities. Five of our subsidiaries, BGCF, GFI Securities LLC, Kyte Securities LLC, Sunrise Brokers LLC and Mint are registered with the SEC and subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements. As Futures
Commissions Merchants (&#147;FCMs&#148;), BGCF and Mint are also subject to CFTC capital requirements. BGCF is also a member of the FICC, which imposes capital requirements on its members. We also hold a 49% limited partnership interest in Aqua, a
U.S. registered broker-dealer and ATS. These entities are subject to SEC, FINRA, CFTC and NFA net capital requirements. In addition, our SEFs, BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, are required to maintain financial resources to cover
operating costs for at least one year, keeping at least enough cash or highly liquid securities to cover six months&#146; operating costs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our international operations are also subject to capital requirements in their local jurisdictions. BGC Brokers L.P., BGC European Holdings,
L.P., GFI Brokers Limited, GFI Securities Limited and Sunrise Brokers LLP, which are based in the UK, are currently subject to capital requirements established by the FCA. The FCA applies stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to
the operation of these brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of their activities. The provisions relating to capital and liquidity requirements enforced by the FCA have undergone significant change in recent years, and our
UK businesses are now required to maintain significantly higher regulatory levels of capital than they have in the past. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition,
the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do business, such as Australia, France and Hong Kong. These regulations often include minimum capital
requirements, which are subject to change. Further, we may become subject to capital requirements in other foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may enter. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to continue to maintain levels of capital in excess of regulatory minimums. Should we fail to maintain the required capital, we may
be required to reduce or suspend our broker-dealer operations during the period that we are not in compliance with capital requirements, and may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration or withdrawal of authorization or other
disciplinary action from domestic and international regulators, which would have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, should we fail to maintain the capital required by clearing organizations of which we are a member, our ability to clear
through those clearing organizations may be impaired, which may materially adversely affect our ability to process trades. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the
capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against capital, our operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited. Our ability to withdraw capital from our regulated subsidiaries is subject to
restrictions, which, in turn, could limit our ability to pay our indebtedness and other expenses, dividends on our Class&nbsp;A common stock, and distributions on our BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, and to repurchase shares of our
Class&nbsp;A common stock or purchase BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others, and pursue strategic acquisitions or
other growth opportunities. It is possible that capital requirements may also be relaxed as a result of future changes in U.S. regulation, although no assurance can be given that such changes will occur. We cannot predict our future capital needs or
our ability to obtain additional financing. No assurance can be given that required capital levels will remain stable or that we will not incur substantial expenses in connection with maintaining current or increased capital levels or engaging in
business restructurings or other activities in response to these requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, financial intermediary firms such as ours
are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts, including for example principal trading and trading to make markets. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts,
and we will regularly seek to review and update our policies, controls and procedures. However, these policies, controls and procedures may result in increased costs and additional operational personnel. Failure to adhere to these policies, controls

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial services industry, in general, is heavily regulated. Proposals for additional
legislation further regulating the financial services industry are periodically introduced in the U.S., the EU and other geographic areas. Moreover, the agencies regulating the financial services industry also periodically adopt changes to their
rules and regulations, particularly as these agencies have increased the focus and intensity of their regulation of the financial services industry. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Changes in legislation and in the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the NFA, the U.S. Treasury, the FCA, the
European Commission, the ESMA and other domestic and international regulators and self-regulatory organizations, as well as changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, often directly affect the method of operation and
profitability of broker-dealers and could result in restrictions in the way we conduct our businesses. For example, the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, SEC and the CFTC are continuing to review
the nature and scope of their regulation and oversight of the government securities markets and U.S. markets. The final draft of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive Level&nbsp;2 Regulatory Technical Standards (&#147;MiFID II&#148;) was
published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (&#147;ESMA&#148;) in September 2015 where implementation is now expected to commence in January 2018. MiFID II will have a particularly significant impact in a number of key areas,
including corporate governance, transaction reporting, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-</FONT> and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection. MiFID II will also introduce a new regulated
execution venue category known as the Organized Trading Facility, and there is currently expected to be a joint equivalence assessment by EU and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-EU</FONT> jurisdictions for granting mutual access to their
respective domestic marketplaces. MiFID II may require us to carry out internal reorginzations and possibly apply for additional licenses. Therefore, uncertainties resulting from the possibility of additional legislation and/or regulation could
materially adversely impact our businesses. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions or limitations on business activity, suspension or expulsion from the industry, any of which
could have a material adverse effect upon us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, while the recently adopted Volcker Rule will not apply directly to us, once
effective, the Volcker Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be a continued uncertainty regarding the application of the Volcker Rule, its impact on various
affected businesses, how those businesses will respond to it, and the effect that it will have on the markets in which we do business. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other regulatory initiatives include Basel III (or the Third Basel Accord), a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress
testing and market liquidity risk scheduled to be introduced by bank regulators in most, if not all, of the world&#146;s major economies by 2019. Basel III is designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory
requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate proprietary trading businesses and to maintain current market exposures under
the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces. As a result, their businesses, results of operations, financial condition or prospects
could be materially adversely affected, which might cause them to do less business. Such potential impact could materially adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our Financial Services segment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, the authorities of certain EU countries may from time to time institute changes to tax law that, if applicable to us, could have a
material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similarly, the U.S. has proposed a series of changes to U.S. tax law, some of which could apply to us. It is not possible to predict if any of these
new provisions will be enacted or, if they are, what form they may take. It is possible that one or more of such provisions could negatively impact our costs and our effective tax rate, which would affect our
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">after-tax</FONT> earnings. If any of such changes to tax law were implemented and/or deemed to apply to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects, including on our ability to attract, compensate and retain executives and brokers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Republican Party control of both the U.S.
Presidency and Congress could result in changes in legislation, regulations and priorities, including a freeze and review of pending regulations and possible revisions or relaxation of other regulations or initiatives. While we continue to have a
compliance framework in place to comply with both existing and proposed rules and regulations, it is possible that the existing regulatory framework may be amended, which amendments could have a positive or negative impact on our businesses,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such
new laws and regulations might take may negatively impact trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. We believe that it remains premature to know conclusively the
specific aspects of the U.S. and EU proposals which may directly impact our businesses as some proposals have not yet been finalized and others which have been proposed remain subject to supervisory debate. Additionally, unintended consequences of
the laws, rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar
changes to laws, rules or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our

businesses. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial services industry, including our businesses, is subject to extensive regulation, which is very costly. The
requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us and are not designed to protect the holders of our stock, notes or other securities.
These regulations will often serve to restrict or limit our operations and activities, including through capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around
the world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to bring enforcement
actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations, inspections, and investigations, which may result in costs, penalties, fines, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements, restrictions or limitations, and
censure, suspension, or expulsion. Self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA and the NFA, along with statutory bodies such as the SEC, the CFTC, and the FCA, and other international regulators, require strict compliance with their rules and
regulations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Firms in the financial services industry, including us, have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years, and penalties,
fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the NFA, state securities commissions and state attorneys general in the U.S., and the FCA in the UK and other international regulators, have increased
accordingly. This trend toward a heightened regulatory and enforcement environment can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and this environment may create uncertainty. From time to time, we have been and are subject to periodic
examinations, inspections and investigations, including periodic risk assessment and related reviews of our UK group. As a result of such reviews, we may be required to include or enhance certain regulatory structures and frameworks in our operating
procedures, systems and controls. We are also required to obtain approval from the FCA to acquire control of UK regulated firms. Increasingly, the FCA has developed a practice of requiring senior officers of regulated firms to provide individual
attestations or undertakings as to the status of the firm&#146;s control environment, compliance with specific rules and regulations, or the completion of required tasks. Officers of BGC Brokers L.P. and GFI Brokers Limited have given such
attestations or undertakings in the past and may do so again in the future. Similarly, the FCA can seek a voluntary requirement notice, which is a voluntary undertaking on behalf of a firm that is made publicly available on the FCA&#146;s website.
These activities have resulted, and may in the future result, in significant costs and remediation expenses, and possible disciplinary actions by the SEC, the CFTC, the FCA, self-regulatory organizations and state securities administrators and have
impacted, and may impact in the future, our acquisitions of regulated businesses or entry into new business lines. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The brokerage and
financial services industries in general face substantial regulatory and litigation risks that may result in damages as well as costs, and we may face damage to our professional reputation and legal liability if our products and services are not
regarded as satisfactory or for other reasons, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many aspects of our current businesses involve substantial risks of liability. The expansion of our businesses, including into new areas,
imposes additional risks of liability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the normal course of business, we have been a party to investigations, administrative
proceedings, lawsuits, arbitrations and other actions involving primarily claims for damages. Examinations, inspections, regulatory inquiries and subpoenas or other requests for information or testimony may cause us to incur significant expenses,
including fees for legal representation and other professional advisors and costs associated with document production and remediation efforts. Such regulatory or other actions may also be directed at certain executives or employees who may be
critical to our businesses or to particular brokerage desks. The risks associated with such matters often may be difficult to assess or quantify, and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A settlement of, or judgment related to, any such matters could result in civil or criminal liability, penalties, fines, restrictions or
limitations on our operations and activities and other sanctions and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Any such action could also cause us significant
reputational harm, which, in turn, could seriously harm us. In addition, regardless of the outcome of such matters, we may incur significant legal and other costs, including substantial management time, dealing with such matters, even if we are not
a party to the litigation or a target of the inquiry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our Financial Services segment, we depend to a large extent on our
relationships with our customers and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain customers. As a result, if our customers are not satisfied with our products or services, such dissatisfaction may be more
damaging to our Financial Services businesses than to other types of businesses. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects, or cause significant reputational damage to us, which could seriously harm us. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Because competition for the services of brokers is intense, it could affect our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly
skilled brokers or other professional services personnel, in turn adversely impacting our revenues, resulting in a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to provide high-quality brokerage and other professional services and maintain long-term relationships with our customers
depends, in large part, upon our brokers and other professionals in both of our segments. As a result, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, we have significantly grown the number of brokers in our businesses through new hires and acquisitions of existing
businesses, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Competition for the services of brokers is intense, especially for brokers with experience in the specialized businesses in which we participate or we may seek to enter. If we are unable
to hire or retain highly qualified brokers, including retaining those employed by businesses we acquire in the future, we may not be able to enter new brokerage markets or develop new products or services. If we lose one or more of our brokers in a
particular market in which we participate, our revenues may decrease and we may lose market share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, recruitment and
retention of qualified brokers could result in substantial additional costs. We have been and are currently a party to, or otherwise involved in, several lawsuits and arbitrations involving competitor claims in connection with employee hires and/or
departures. We may also pursue our rights through litigation when competitors hire our employees who are under contract with us. We believe such proceedings are common in the financial services industry due to its highly competitive nature. An
adverse settlement or judgment related to these or similar types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Regardless of the outcome of these claims, we generally
incur significant costs and substantial management time in dealing with them. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we fail to attract new personnel, or fail to retain and
motivate our current personnel, or if we incur increased costs or restrictions associated with attracting and retaining personnel (such as lawsuits, arbitrations, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">sign-on</FONT> or guaranteed bonuses or forgivable
loans), our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We face
strong competition from brokerages, broker-dealers, financial services firms, and exchanges, many of which have greater market presence, marketing capabilities and financial, technological and personnel resources than we have, which could lead to
pricing pressures that could adversely impact our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial services industry is intensely competitive, and is expected to remain so. In our Financial Services segment, we primarily
compete with three major, diversified inter-dealer brokers and financial intermediaries. These include NEX Group plc (&#147;NEX&#148;) (formerly known as ICAP plc),TP ICAP plc (&#147;TP ICAP&#148;) (formerly known as Tullett Prebon plc) and
Compagnie Financiere Tradition (which is majority owned by Viel&nbsp;&amp; Cie) (&#147;Tradition&#148;), all of which are currently publicly traded companies. On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring 100% of GFI&#146;s
outstanding shares (see Item&nbsp;1 &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148;). Other inter-dealer broker and financial intermediary competitors include a number of smaller, privately-held firms that tend to specialize in specific products and
services or geographic areas. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also compete with companies that provide alternative products and services, such as contracts traded on
futures exchanges, and trading processes, such as the direct <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">dealer-to-dealer</FONT></FONT> market for government securities and stock exchange markets for corporate equities, debt
and other securities. We increasingly compete, directly or indirectly, with exchanges for the execution of trades in certain products, mainly in derivatives such as futures, swaps, options and options on futures. Certain exchanges have made and will
likely continue to make attempts to move certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">OTC-traded</FONT> products to exchange-based execution, or to create listed derivatives products that mimic the qualities of similar
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">OTC-traded</FONT> products. We also compete with consortia, such as those operated by Tradeweb, which are created or funded from time to time by banks, broker-dealers and other companies involved in financial
services, such as Thomson Reuters Corporation to compete in various markets with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers. We may compete in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">OTC-traded</FONT> products with platforms such as those owned by MarketAxess
Holdings Inc., in fixed income products or various OTC FX platforms owned by exchanges such as BATS and Deutsche B&ouml;rse. In addition, financial data and information firms such as Thomson Reuters Corporation and Bloomberg L.P. operate trading
platforms for both OTC and listed products, and may attempt to compete with us for trade execution in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of our

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Credit rating downgrades or defaults by us, Cantor or another large financial institution could adversely affect us or financial markets
generally. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading,
clearing or other relationships between the institutions. For example, we rely on Cantor as our clearing agent under the Clearing Agreement for certain securities transactions, primarily U.S. government securities, while we self-clear certain other
products. A default by one of our customers could lead to liquidity concerns in our business and, to the extent that Cantor or another entity that clears for us has difficulty meeting capital requirements or otherwise meeting its obligations, we may
need to provide our own liquidity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to
significant market-wide liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as &#147;systemic risk&#148; and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks,
securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. Similarly, our vendors, including insurance companies and other providers, are subject to normal business risks as well as risks
related to U.S. and international economic and market conditions. Failure of any of these vendor institutions could also materially adversely affect us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The credit ratings and associated outlooks of firms in our financial services industries, including us, may be critical to their reputation
and operational and financial success. A firm&#146;s credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and
liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels, the firm&#146;s competitive position
in the industry and its relationship with other firms. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances of that firm or related firms
warrant such a change. Any reduction in credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on acceptable terms, as well as the cost and other terms upon which any such financing can be obtained. In
addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties in certain markets and in certain transactions. Additional collateral may be required in the event of a credit ratings or outlook downgrade. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our financial services activities are subject to credit and performance risks, which could result in us incurring significant losses that
could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our activities are
subject to credit and performance risks. For example, our customers may not deliver securities to one of our operating subsidiaries which has sold those securities to another customer. If the securities due to be delivered have increased in value,
there is a risk that we may have to expend our own funds in connection with the purchase of other securities to consummate the transaction. While we will take steps to ensure that our customers and counterparties have high credit standings and that
financing transactions are adequately collateralized, the large dollar amounts that may be involved in our broker-dealer and financing transactions could subject us to significant losses if, as a result of customer or counterparty failures to meet
commitments, we were to incur significant costs in liquidating or covering our positions in the open market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have adopted policies
and procedures to identify, monitor and manage credit risk, in both agency and principal transactions, through reporting and control procedures and by monitoring credit standards applicable to our customers and counterparties. These policies and
procedures, however, may not be fully effective, particularly against fraud, unauthorized trading and similar incidents. Some of these risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, counterparties or
other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">up-to-date</FONT></FONT> or properly evaluated.
If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are, or may be, exposed, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be
materially adversely affected. In addition, our insurance policies do not provide coverage for these risks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Transactions executed on a
matched principal basis where the instrument has the same or similar characteristics to the counterparty may expose us to correlation risk. In this case, the counterparty&#146;s inability to meet its obligations will also result in the value of the
instrument declining. For example, if we were to enter into a transaction to sell to a customer a bond or structured note where the issuer or credit support provider was such customer&#146;s affiliate, the value of the instrument would decline in
value in tandem with the default. This correlation has the effect of magnifying the credit loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are subject to financing risk
because, if a transaction does not settle on a timely basis, the resulting unmatched position may need to be financed, either directly by us or through one of the clearing organizations, at our expense. These charges may be recoverable from the
failing counterparty, but sometimes they are not. In addition, in instances where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged or widespread due to rapid or widespread declines in liquidity for an instrument, there may also be
regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us, which, depending on their size and duration, could limit our business flexibility or even force the curtailment of those portions of our businesses requiring higher levels of capital. Credit or
settlement losses of this nature could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Declines in the financial markets have also led to the exposure of several cases of financial
fraud. If we were to have trading activity on an agency or principal basis with an entity engaged in defrauding investors or counterparties, we could bear the risk that the counterparty would not have the financial resources to meet their
obligations, resulting in a credit loss. Similarly, we may engage in financial transactions with third parties that have been victims of financial fraud and, therefore, may not have the financial resources to meet their obligations to us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In agency transactions, we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other
material terms of the transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and leave them to settle the trade directly. We are exposed to credit risk for commissions, as we bill
customers for our agency brokerage services. Our customers may default on their obligations to us due to disputes, bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Any losses arising from such defaults could materially adversely
affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In certain financial products, we act as a &#147;name
passing&#148; broker, where the parties to the trade will settle directly against each other when their names are given up. In these markets, we may from time to time provide quotes. These quotes are intended to provide market values where we
believe a customer can execute a transaction in a particular financial product. These quotes reflect our good faith view as to a reasonable bid/offer for that particular product. Prices may be received directly from a customer, or we may provide
prices where we are confident the customers will be able to execute a trade, but do not have a customer currently supporting the price. In these cases the price will be based on our professional judgment. We may post or provide bids and offers in an
effort (i)&nbsp;to present suitable markets where none would otherwise exist, or (ii)&nbsp;to exhibit spreads that are more reflective of contemporaneous market opinion or activity. In such cases, our efforts are intended to facilitate liquidity for
our customers and to draw market participants to participate in a transaction. Although we will exercise strenuous efforts to execute at any given price, we cannot guarantee an execution at a certain price level. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>In emerging market countries, we primarily conduct our financial services businesses on an agency and matched principal basis, where the
risk of counterparty default, inconvertibility events and sovereign default is greater than in more developed countries. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We enter
into transactions in cash and derivative instruments primarily on an agency and matched principal basis with counterparties domiciled in countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Transactions with these counterparties are generally in
instruments or contracts of sovereign or corporate issuers located in the same country as the counterparty. This exposes us to a higher degree of sovereign or convertibility risk than in more developed countries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, these risks may entail correlated risks. A correlated risk arises when the counterparty&#146;s inability to meet its obligations
also corresponds to a decline in the value of the instrument traded. In the case of a sovereign convertibility event or outright default, the counterparty to the trade may be unable to pay or transfer payment of an instrument purchased out of the
country when the value of the instrument has declined due to the default or convertibility event. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The global financial crisis of recent
years has heightened the risk of sovereign or convertibility events in emerging markets similar to the events that occurred in previous financial downturns. Our risk management function monitors the creditworthiness of emerging countries and
counterparties on an ongoing basis and, when the risk of inconvertibility or sovereign default is deemed to be too great, correlated transactions or all transactions may be restricted or suspended. However, there can be no assurance that these
procedures will be effective in controlling these risks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Concentration and Market Risk </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Financial Services segment has its rates business as its largest product category, and we could be significantly affected by any
downturn in the rates product market. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We offer our financial services in five broad product categories: rates, credit, foreign
exchange, energy and commodities and equity and other asset classes. Our financial services brokerage revenues are strongest in our rates products, which accounted for approximately 32.1% of our total financial services brokerage revenues on a
consolidated basis for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. While we focus on expanding and have successfully diversified our product offerings, we may currently be exposed to any adverse change or condition affecting the rates product market.
Accordingly, the concentration of our businesses on rates products subjects our results to a greater market risk than if we had more diversified product offerings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Due to our current customer concentration, a loss of one or more of our significant customers could materially harm our businesses,

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, on a consolidated basis, our top ten Financial
Services customers collectively, accounted for approximately 15.7% of our total revenues. We have limited long-term contracts with certain of these customers. If we were to lose one or more of these significant customers for any reason, including as
a result of further consolidation and concentration in the financial services industry, and not be compensated for such loss by doing additional business with other customers or by adding new customers, our revenues would decline significantly and
our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would materially suffer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our financial services revenues and
profitability could be reduced or otherwise materially adversely affected by pricing plans relating to commissions and fees on our trading platform. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We negotiate from time to time with certain customers (including many of our largest customers) to enter into customized volume discount
pricing plans. While the pricing plans are designed to encourage customers to be more active on our electronic trading platform, they reduce the amount of commissions and fees payable to us by certain of our most active customers for certain
products, which could reduce our revenues and constrain our profitability. From time to time, these pricing plans come up for renewal. Failure of a number of our larger customers to enter into renewed agreements, or agreements on terms as favorable
as existing agreements, could have a material adverse effect on volumes on our electronic trading platform, the commissions payable to us, our revenues and our profitability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Reduced spreads in securities pricing, levels of trading activity and trading through market makers and/or specialists could materially
adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Computer-generated buy/sell programs and
other technological advances and regulatory changes in the marketplace may continue to tighten securities spreads. In addition, new and enhanced alternative trading systems, such as electronic communications networks, have emerged as alternatives
for individual and institutional investors, as well as broker-dealers. As such systems do not direct trades through market makers, their use could result in reduced revenues for us or for our customers. In addition, reduced trading levels could lead
to lower revenues which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We have market risk exposure from unmatched principal transactions entered into by some of our desks, as well as holdings of marketable
equity securities, which could result in losses and have a material effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects for any particular reporting period. In addition, financial fraud or unauthorized trading
activity could also materially impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On a limited basis,
our desks enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business to facilitate transactions, add liquidity, improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue opportunities and attract additional order flow or in certain
instances as the result of an error and, in a limited number of instances and subject to risk management limits, for the purpose of proprietary trading. As a result, we have market risk exposure on these unmatched principal transactions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses
for a specified position. In our Financial Services business, we may allow certain of our desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are
primarily for the purpose of managing proprietary positions, facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow<B>. </B>As a result, we may have market risk exposure on these transactions.
Our exposure varies based on the size of the overall position, the terms and liquidity of the instruments brokered and the amount of time the position is held before we dispose of the position. Although we have limited ability to track our exposure
to market risk and unmatched positions on an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">intra-day</FONT> basis, we attempt to mitigate market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging our exposure. These
positions are intended to be held short term to facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, we may not be able to unwind the position and we
may be forced to hold the position for a longer period than anticipated. All positions held longer than <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">intra-day</FONT> are marked to market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain categories of trades settle for clearing purposes with CF&amp;Co, one of our affiliates. CF&amp;Co is a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (&#147;FINRA&#148;) and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (&#147;FICC&#148;), a subsidiary of the Depository Trust&nbsp;&amp; Clearing Corporation. We, CF&amp;Co and other affiliates act in a matched principal or
principal capacity in markets by posting and/or acting upon quotes for our account. Such activity is intended, among other things, to assist us, CF&amp;Co and our affiliates in managing proprietary positions (including, but not limited to, those
established as a result of combination trades and errors), facilitating transactions, framing markets, adding liquidity, increasing commissions and attracting order flow. Similarly, when framing a market in a &#147;name passing &#148; marketplace,
BGC and its affiliates&nbsp;may post quotations that we believe reflect contemporaneous and/or anticipated potential market interest in an effort to facilitate liquidity for market participants on our respective platforms. The firms use commercially
reasonable efforts to find a counterparty for any resulting transactions, at the customary minimum size level for that market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From a
risk management perspective, we monitor risk on an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-of-day</FONT></FONT> basis, and desk managers generally monitor such exposure on a continuous basis. Any unmatched positions are

unmatched positions are not disposed of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">intra-day,</FONT> we mark these positions to market. Adverse movements in the securities underlying these positions or a
downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a loss. In the event of any unauthorized trading activity or financial fraud that is not detected by management, it is possible that these unmatched positions could be
outstanding for a long period. At the time of any sales and settlements of these positions, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair
values. In addition, our estimates or determinations of the values of our various positions, assets or businesses are subject to the accuracy of our assumptions and the valuation models or multiples used. Any principal losses and gains resulting

Trayport. We may seek to manage the market risk exposure inherent in such holdings by minimizing the effect of price changes on a portion of such holdings through the use of derivative contracts. There can, however, be no assurance that our hedging
activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with these holdings, or that the costs of such hedging activities will not be significant. Further, any such hedging activities and other risk management techniques may not be

in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency rates create volatility in the U.S. dollar equivalent of revenues and expenses, in particular with regard to British Pounds and Euros. In addition, changes in the remeasurement of our foreign
currency denominated net assets are recorded as part of our results of operations and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. We monitor our net exposure in foreign currencies and markets on a daily basis and hedge our exposure as deemed
appropriate with highly rated major financial institutions. However, potential movements in the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we earn revenues could materially adversely affect our financial results. </P>

developments in such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> jurisdictions. Revenues from the trading of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors.

customers are not able to settle their transactions on a timely basis, the time in which employee errors and miscommunication are detected may be increased and our risk of material loss could be increased. The risk of employee error and

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We value the expansion of business relationships with individual corporate clients because of the increased efficiency and economics that can
result from developing repeat business from the same client and from performing an increasingly broad range of services for the same client. Although our client portfolio is currently highly diversified&#151;for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2016, our top ten Real Estate servicesclients, collectively, accounted for less than 3% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis, and our largest client accounted for less than 1% of our total revenue on a consolidated basis&#151;as we grow our
business, relationships with certain corporate clients may increase, and our client portfolio may become increasingly concentrated. For example, part of our strategy is to increase our GCS revenues which may lead to greater concentration of revenues
with corporate clients. Part of our strategy is to increase our global corporate services revenue which may lead to greater concentration of revenue with corporate clients in the future. Having increasingly large and concentrated clients also can
lead to greater or more concentrated risks of loss if, among other possibilities, any such client (1)&nbsp;experiences its own financial problems; (2)&nbsp;becomes bankrupt or insolvent, which can lead to our failure to be paid for services we have

whom we provide management services, claiming that we did not fulfill our obligations. We could also become subject to claims made by clients for whom we provided appraisal and valuation services and/or third parties who perceive themselves as
having been negatively affected by our appraisals and/or valuations. We also could be subject to audits and/or fines from various local real estate authorities if they determine that we are violating licensing laws by failing to follow certain laws,
rules and regulations. While these liabilities have been insignificant in the past, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our property and facilities management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide services for our managed
properties. We may be subject to claims for defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions or omissions by third parties we do not control. Moreover, our clients may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because
of our role as property or facilities manager or project manager, even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a contractual matter, in which case we may be pressured to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the
client relationship. While these liabilities have been insignificant in the past, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case. </P>

objectives. In the event that these objectives are not met, we are obligated to pay the shortfall amount to the client. In most instances, the obligation to pay such amount is limited to the amount of fees (or the amount of a subset of the fees)
earned by us under the contract, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to mitigate against these payments or that the payments, particularly if aggregated with those required under other agreements, could have a material adverse effect
on our ongoing arrangements with particular clients or our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. The percentage of our Real Estate Services revenue for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 subject to such
obligations under our current facilities management agreements is less than 1%. While these liabilities have been immaterial to date, we have no assurance that this will continue to be the case. </P>

litigation risks may be mitigated by any commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate. However, in the event of a substantial loss or certain types of claims, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels
might not be sufficient to pay the full damages. Additionally, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, insurance policies that we may have may not cover us at all. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold
under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company&#146;s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly rated companies. In addition, in the event
of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, we may not be covered by insurance. Any of these events could materially negatively impact our commercial real estate business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. While

state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations specific to our services. For example, the brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and other related activities require us to maintain brokerage licenses in each state in which we
conduct activities for which a real estate license is required. If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct brokerage activities without a license or violate any of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our licenses, then we may be

various environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, and disclosure obligations which impact the management, development, use and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities, as well as
mortgage lending availability, with respect to some properties. A decrease or delay in such transactions may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, a failure by us to
disclose environmental concerns in connection with a real estate transaction may subject us to liability to a buyer/seller or lessee/lessor of property. While historically we have not incurred any significant liability in connection with these types
of environmental issues, there is no assurance that this will not occur. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in our role as property or facilities manager, we
could incur liability under environmental laws for the investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes at properties we currently or formerly managed. Such liability may be imposed without regard to the lawfulness of the
original disposal activity, or our knowledge of, or fault for, the release or contamination. Further, liability under some of these laws may be joint and several, meaning that one liable party could be held responsible for all costs related to a
contaminated site. Insurance for such matters may not be available or sufficient. While historically we have not incurred any significant liability under these laws, this may not always be the case. </P>

bankruptcy of a client or other party obligated to make payments to us would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us. In addition, certain corporate services and property and facilities management agreements require that we advance
payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients. If such a client or other party obligated to make payments to us were to file for bankruptcy, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would
incur. Any such failure to make payments when due or the bankruptcy or insolvency of a large number of our clients (e.g. during an economic downturn) could result in disruption to our Real Estate Services businesses and material losses to us. Part

their respective markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees. Through these independently owned offices, our clients have access to additional brokers with local market research capabilities as well as other commercial real estate
services in locations where we do not have a physical presence. From time to time our arrangement with these independent firms may be terminated pursuant to the terms of the individual affiliation agreements. The opening of a Company-owned office to
replace an independent office requires us to invest capital, which in some cases could be material. There can be no assurance that, if we lose additional independently owned offices, we will be able to identify suitable replacement affiliates or
fund the establishment or acquisition of an owned office. In addition, although we do not control the activities of these independently owned offices, we may face reputational risk if any of these independently owned offices are involved in or
accused of illegal, unethical or similar behavior. Failure to maintain coverage in important geographic markets may negatively impact our operations, reputation and ability to attract and retain key employees and expand domestically and

profitability and strategic and operating needs of our businesses,&nbsp;including various capital adequacy and clearing capital requirements promulgated by federal, self-regulatory, and other authorities to which our subsidiaries are subject. We

authorization was increased back to $300&nbsp;million. As of February 28, 2017, we had approximately $298.8&nbsp;million remaining under this $300&nbsp;million authorization and may continue to actively make such repurchases or purchases, or cease
to make such repurchases or purchases, from time to time. In addition, from time to time, we may reinvest all or a portion of the distributions we receive in BGC U.S.&#146;s and BGC Global&#146;s respective businesses, although we neither have
current plans to do so nor do we expect to do so as long as we maintain our current dividend policy. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that future dividends will be paid or that dividend amounts will be maintained at current or future levels.

distribute to our stockholders, then as founding/working partners, limited partnership unit holders and/or Cantor exercise any exchange right to acquire our Class&nbsp;A common stock or Class&nbsp;B common stock, as applicable, exchanging partners
may receive a disproportionate interest in the aggregate distributions by BGC U.S. and BGC Global that have not been distributed by us. The reason is that the exchanging partner could receive both (1)&nbsp;the benefit of the distribution that has
not been distributed by us from BGC U.S. and BGC Global to BGC Holdings (in the form of a distribution by BGC Holdings to its limited partners) and (2)&nbsp;the benefit of the distribution from BGC U.S. and BGC Global to us (in the form of a
subsequent cash dividend paid by us, a greater percentage indirect interest in BGC U.S. and BGC Global following a repurchase of Class&nbsp;A common stock by us or a greater value of assets following a purchase of assets by us with the cash that
otherwise would be distributed to our stockholders). Consequently, if our dividend policy does not match the distribution policy of BGC Holdings, other holders of Class&nbsp;A common stock and Class&nbsp;B common stock as of the date of an exchange
could experience a reduction in their interest in the profits previously distributed by BGC U.S. and BGC Global that have not been distributed by us. Our current dividend policy could result in distributions to our common stockholders that are

thereunder contain detailed prescriptions for the organization and operations of investment companies. Among other things, the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, limit the issuance of debt

Therefore, if Cantor, we, or BGC Holdings became subject to the Investment Company Act, it could make it impractical to continue our businesses, impair agreements and arrangements, and impair the transactions contemplated by those agreements and

compensate and motivate these persons. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests entitle founding/working and other limited partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our businesses, upon leaving BGC Holdings

account or post-termination amount, if any, and not any goodwill or going concern value of our businesses. Further, certain partner units have no right to a post-termination payment, receive a preferred but fixed distribution amount, and/or cannot
be made exchangeable into shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. Moreover, unless and until units are made exchangeable, limited partners have no unilateral right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests for shares of

from BGC Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests generally when founding partner units are redeemed or granted exchangeability will result in the share of distributions of income from the operations of our businesses on other outstanding
BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, including those held by founding/working and other limited partners, to remain the same rather than increasing as would be the case if such interests were redeemed or granted exchangeability without such
Cantor right to purchase. In addition, any purchase of exchangeable limited partnership units by Cantor from BGC Holdings following Cantor&#146;s decision to grant exchangeability on founding partner units will result in additional dilution to the

and certain other tax benefits related to its entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. It is expected that we will benefit from the remaining 15% cash savings, if
any, in income tax that we realize. Cantor has not exercised this right to date, but there can be no assurance that it will not do so in the future. </P>

of our shares under the Sales Agreement and the liquidity and depth of our market, we may sell a greater aggregate number of shares, at a lower average price per share, under the Sales Agreement than the number of shares or units repurchased or

of shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and purchases of BGC Holdings units or other equity interests in us or in our subsidiaries from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners, and others, and/or to replenish cash used to effect
such repurchases and purchases. From January&nbsp;1, 2016 to December&nbsp;31, 2016, we repurchased an aggregate of 10.8&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $96.0&nbsp;million with an
average repurchase price of $8.88 per share. During that period, we redeemed for cash an aggregate of 7.2&nbsp;million limited partnership units at an average price of $9.10 per unit and an aggregate of 319.2&nbsp;thousand founding/working partner
units at an average price of $8.64 per unit. In the future, we expect to continue to repurchase shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and redeem or purchase BGC Holdings units from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners, and

that we seek to sell shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock to raise net proceeds for repurchases of shares and purchases of units, depending upon the timing and prices of the repurchases of shares and purchases of units and of the sales of our
shares and the liquidity and depth of our market, we may in fact sell a greater aggregate number of shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, at a lower average price per share, in our offerings than the aggregate number of shares repurchased and
units purchased by us and the average price per share or unit that we are paying in such repurchases and purchases. Thus, our strategy may result in an increase in the number of our shares and units outstanding and a decrease in our earnings per

increase as we increase the amount of cash available for dividends and share repurchases and unit purchases by paying a portion of the compensation of our employees in the form of partnership units and restricted stock, gradually lowering our
compensation expenses for purposes of distributable earnings, and lowering our long-term effective tax rate for distributable earnings, there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful or that we can achieve any or all of such

financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts, changes in analysts&#146; recommendations or projections, seasonality, changes in general valuations for companies in our business segments, changes in general economic or

could result in a decline in the market price of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. Declines in the price of our Class&nbsp;A common stock may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees, including brokers, salespeople, managers and

BGC Global. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by regulatory considerations as well as by covenants contained in financing or other agreements. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is our
net assets minus our capital (as defined under Delaware law), or, if we have no surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Accordingly, any unanticipated accounting, tax,
regulatory or other charges against net income may adversely affect our ability to declare dividends. While we intend to declare and pay dividends quarterly, there can be no assurance that our board of directors will declare dividends at all or on a
regular basis or that the amount of our dividends will not change. </P>

Grubb Knight Frank (which may be referred to as &#147;Newmark&#148;, or &#147;NGKF&#148;) is our leading commercial real estate services business. Newmark offers commercial real estate tenants, owner-occupiers, investors and developers a wide range

prospects as we continue to increase the scale and depth of our Financial Services and Real Estate Services platforms and continue to seek market-driven opportunities to expand our business in numerous financial asset classes and other products and
services. This was exemplified by our acquisition of GFI Group, Inc. (&#147;GFI&#148;). Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, BGC began consolidating the results of GFI, which continues to operate as a separately branded division of BGC. On
January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring 100% of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares (see &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group, Inc.&#148;). During 2016, we also completed the purchase of Rudesill-Pera Multifamily, The CRE Group,
Inc. (&#147;CRE Group&#148;), Perimeter Markets, Inc., certain assets of the John Buck Company, LLC and Buck Management Group LLC, Continental Realty Ltd, Newmark Grubb Mexico City, the businesses of Sunrise Brokers Group, and Walchle Lear
Multifamily Advisors. By adding these leading companies to our platform, we have greatly broadened the scope and depth of services we can provide to our clients across our consolidated business. We have also continued to make key hires around the
world and integrate our recent acquisitions onto our global platform. We expect these additions to increase our revenues and earnings per share going forward. These investments underscore BGC&#146;s ongoing commitment to make accretive acquisitions

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Acquisition of GFI Group, Inc. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">GFI is a leading intermediary and provider of trading technologies and support services to the global OTC and listed markets. GFI serves
institutional clients in operating electronic and hybrid markets for cash and derivative products across multiple asset classes. On February&nbsp;26, 2015, we successfully completed our tender offer to acquire shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of GFI for $6.10 per share in cash and accepted for purchase 54.3&nbsp;million shares tendered to us pursuant to the offer. The tendered shares, together with the 17.1&nbsp;million shares already owned by us, represented approximately 56%
of the then-outstanding shares of GFI. We issued payment for the tendered shares on March&nbsp;4, 2015 in the aggregate amount of $331.1&nbsp;million. On April&nbsp;28, 2015, we purchased from GFI approximately 43.0&nbsp;million new shares at that
date&#146;s closing price of $5.81 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250&nbsp;million. The purchase price was paid to GFI in the form of a note due on June&nbsp;19, 2018 that bore an interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The new
shares and the note are eliminated in consolidation. Following the issuance of the new shares, we owned approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock, which gave us control over the timing and process for the completion of a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">back-end</FONT> merger (the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;Back-End</FONT> Mergers&#148;) pursuant to the tender offer agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed our acquisition (the &#147;JPI Merger&#148;) of Jersey Partners, Inc. (&#147;JPI&#148;). The JPI Merger
occurred pursuant to a merger agreement, dated as of December&nbsp;22, 2015. Shortly following the completion of the JPI Merger, a subsidiary of BGC merged with and into GFI pursuant to a short-form merger under Delaware law, with GFI continuing as
the surviving entity. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Back-End</FONT> Mergers allowed BGC to acquire the remaining approximately 33% of the outstanding shares of GFI common stock that BGC did not already own.&nbsp;Following the closing of the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Back-End</FONT> Mergers, BGC and its affiliates now own 100% of the outstanding shares of GFI&#146;s common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In total, approximately 23.5&nbsp;million shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock were issued and $111.2&nbsp;million in cash will be paid
with respect to the closing of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Back-End</FONT> Mergers, inclusive of adjustments ($89.9&nbsp;million has been paid as of December&nbsp;31, 2016).&nbsp;The total purchase consideration for all shares of GFI
purchased by BGC was approximately $750&nbsp;million, net of the $250.0&nbsp;million note previously issued to GFI by BGC, which is eliminated in consolidation.&nbsp;This figure excludes the $29.0&nbsp;million gain recorded in the first quarter of
2015 with respect to the appreciation of the 17.1&nbsp;million shares of GFI held by BGC prior to the successful completion of the tender offer. The excess of total consideration over the fair value of the total net assets acquired, of approximately
$450.0&nbsp;million, has been recorded to goodwill and was allocated to our Financial Services segment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe the combination of BGC
and GFI creates a strong and diversified Financial Services business, well-positioned to capture future growth opportunities. Through this combination, we expect to deliver substantial benefits to customers of the combined company, and we expect to
become the largest and most profitable wholesale financial brokerage company. We also believe this is a highly complementary combination, which has resulted, and will continue to result, in meaningful economies of scale. While the front-office
operations will remain separately branded divisions, the back office, technology, and infrastructure of these two companies are being integrated in a smart and deliberate way. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;10, 2015, the Company guaranteed the obligations of GFI under the 8.375% Senior Notes; as a consequence of guaranteeing
GFI&#146;s debt, we have substantially improved the credit rating of GFI&#146;s bonds and lowered future interest payments. We have also been able to free up capital set aside for regulatory and clearing purposes, allowing us to use our balance
sheet more efficiently.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Trayport Transaction </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;11, 2015, we completed the sale (the &#147;Trayport Transaction&#148;) of all of the equity interests in the entities that
make up the Trayport business to Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (&#147;ICE&#148;).&nbsp;The Trayport business was GFI&#146;s electronic European energy software, trading, and market data business. The Trayport Transaction occurred pursuant to a
Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November&nbsp;15, 2015. At the closing, we received 2,527,658 shares of ICE common stock issued with respect to the $650&nbsp;million purchase price, which was adjusted at closing.&nbsp;Through December&nbsp;31,
2016, we have sold more than 95% of our shares of ICE common stock. Trayport, prior to its sale, had generated gross revenues of approximately $80&nbsp;million over the twelve months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015.&nbsp;BGC expects to pay effective
cash taxes of no more than $64&nbsp;million related to the Trayport sale price, or an expected rate of less than 10%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Nasdaq
Transaction </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;28, 2013, we completed the sale of certain assets to Nasdaq, Inc. (&#147;Nasdaq,&#148; formerly known as
&#147;NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.&#148;), which purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our affiliates, including the eSpeed brand name and various assets comprising the fully electronic portion of our benchmark <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-the-run</FONT></FONT> U.S. Treasury brokerage, market data and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-location</FONT> service businesses (&#147;eSpeed&#148;), for cash consideration of
$750&nbsp;million paid at closing, plus an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">earn-out</FONT> of up to 14,883,705 shares of Nasdaq common stock to be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing in which the consolidated gross
revenue of Nasdaq is equal to or greater than $25&nbsp;million. Through December&nbsp;31, 2016, we have received 3,968,988 shares of Nasdaq common stock in accordance with the agreement. The contingent future issuances of Nasdaq common stock are
also subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of the sale of eSpeed, we only sold our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-the-run</FONT></FONT> U.S. Treasuries, as well as across various other products in rates, credit, FX, market data and software solutions. As we continue to focus our efforts on converting voice and hybrid desks to
electronic execution, our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">e-businesses,</FONT> excluding Trayport and revenues from inter-company data, software, and post-trade services, have continued to grow their revenues and generated $208.6&nbsp;million of
net revenues during the most recent trailing twelve-month period ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, up 8.6% from a year ago. These fully electronic revenues are more than double the annualized revenues of eSpeed, which generated $48.6&nbsp;million in
revenues for the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2013 and was sold in the second quarter of 2013 for $1.2&nbsp;billion (based on the value of Nasdaq stock at the time the deal was announced). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the purposes of this document and subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) filings, all of our fully electronic
businesses are referred to as &#147;FENICS.&#148; These offerings include Financial Services segment fully electronic brokerage products, as well as offerings in market data, software solutions, and post-trade services across both BGC and GFI.
FENICS results do not include the results of Trayport, either before or after the completed sale to ICE. Going forward, we expect these businesses to become an even more valuable part of BGC as they continue to grow faster than, and be substantially
larger than, eSpeed ever was for us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Financial Services: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial intermediary sector has been a competitive area that grew over the period between 1998 and 2007 due to several factors. One
factor was the increasing use of derivatives to manage risk or to take advantage of the anticipated direction of a market by allowing users to protect gains and/or guard against losses in the price of underlying assets without having to buy or sell
the underlying assets. Derivatives are often used to mitigate the risks associated with interest rates, equity ownership, changes in the value of foreign currency, credit defaults by corporate and sovereign debtors and changes in the prices of
commodity products. Over this same timeframe, demand from financial institutions, financial services intermediaries and large corporations had increased volumes in the wholesale derivatives market, thereby increasing the business opportunity for
financial intermediaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another key factor in the growth of the financial intermediary sector between 1998 and 2007 was the increase in
the number of new financial products. As market participants and their customers strive to mitigate risk, new types of equity and fixed income securities, futures, options and other financial instruments have been developed. Most of these new
securities and derivatives were not immediately ready for more liquid and standardized electronic markets, and generally increased the need for trading and required broker-assisted execution. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Up until the second half of 2016, our Financial Services businesses had faced more challenging market conditions. Accommodative monetary
policies by several major central banks including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have resulted in historically low levels of volatility and interest rates across many of the financial markets in
which we operate. The global credit markets also faced structural issues such as increased bank capital requirements under Basel III. Consequently, these factors contributed to lower trading volumes in our rates and credit asset classes across most
geographies in which we operated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum regarding continued membership in the European Union
(the &#147;EU&#148;).&nbsp;The exit from the EU is commonly referred to as the &#147;Brexit.&#148; The Brexit vote passed by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum was <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-binding.</FONT> However, the Prime Minister of the
U.K. has indicated that she intends to follow through on the wishes of the voters and that negotiations will commence under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty in March 2017 to determine the future terms of the U.K.&#146;s relationship with the EU,
including the terms of trade, also known as &#147;passporting rights&#148; between the U.K. and the EU. The effects of the Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to EU markets &#150; including for financial services
&#150; either during a transitional period or more permanently. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The announcement of the Brexit contributed to short-term volatility in
most of the global financial markets in which we broker, and also led to currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in significant weakening of the British pound against most major foreign currencies.&nbsp;Although we generate a significant
amount of revenue in the U.K., most of it is denominated in other currencies.&nbsp;However, a majority of our U.K. expenses are denominated in pounds.&nbsp;As a result, we expect the decrease in the value of the pound to have a minimal effect on our
consolidated earnings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since the negotiations for completing the Brexit have not yet commenced, could take up to two years once
initiated, and might involve subsequent negotiations after two years, we anticipate higher than average global financial market volatility to occur periodically for the foreseeable future, all else equal.&nbsp;Historically, elevated volatility has
often led to increased volumes in the Financial Services markets in which we broker, which could be beneficial for our business. However, the outcome of any negotiations between the U.K. and the EU could prove disruptive for our Financial Services
business and/or its customers for a period of time. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulators in the U.S. have finalized most of the new rules across a range of financial
marketplaces, including OTC derivatives, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;). Many of these rules became effective in prior years, while ongoing
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">phase-ins</FONT> are anticipated over coming years. We believe that the recent election results in the U.S. make it possible that some of the Dodd-Frank rules may be modified or repealed, which could be a net
positive for our Financial Services business and its largest customers. However, there can be no assurance that this will be the case, and we continue to expect the industry to be more heavily regulated than it was prior to the financial crisis of
2008/2009, and we are prepared to operate under a variety of regulatory regimes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to regulations in the U.S., legislators and
regulators in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have crafted similar rules, some of which have already been implemented, while the vast majority are expected to be implemented in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">OTC-related</FONT> regulations and proposed rules call for, among other actions, additional <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-</FONT> and post-trade market transparency, heightened collateral and capital standards, the transacting of certain derivatives using authorized venues, central clearing of most standardized derivatives, specific
business conduct standards and the delivery of transaction data to newly designated trade repositories for public dissemination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC
Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, began operating as Swap Execution Facilities (&#147;SEFs&#148;) on October&nbsp;2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from
the Commodity Future Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) as SEFs on January&nbsp;22, 2016.&nbsp;Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for &#147;made available to trade&#148;
products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products were finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. We also own ELX, a CFTC-approved designated contract market (&#147;DCM&#148;).
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As these rules require authorized execution facilities to maintain robust <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">front-end</FONT> and

purchase the vast majority of ICAP&#146;s global hybrid/voice broking, as well as portions of its information businesses. Following the completion of their proposed deal in December of 2016, ICAP changed its corporate name to &#147;NEX Group

platform. We will also continue to compete with TP ICAP across various voice/hybrid brokerage marketplaces. There has also been significant consolidation among smaller <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-public</FONT> wholesale brokers, including
our acquisitions of R.P. Martin, Heat Energy Group, Remate Lince and Sunrise Brokers Group. We view the recent consolidation in the industry favorably, as we expect it to provide additional operating leverage to our Financial Services businesses in
the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Growth Drivers </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a wholesale intermediary, our business is driven primarily by overall industry volumes in the markets in which we broker, the size and
productivity of our front-office headcount (including brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel), regulatory issues, and the percentage of our revenues we are able to generate by fully electronic means. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Below is a brief analysis of the market and industry volumes for some of our financial services products including our overall hybrid and
fully electronic trading activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Overall Market Volumes and Volatility </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Volume is driven by a number of items, including the level of issuance for financial instruments, the price volatility of financial
instruments, macro-economic conditions, the creation and adoption of new products, the regulatory environment, and the introduction and adoption of new trading technologies. Historically, increased price volatility has typically increased the demand
for hedging instruments, including many of the cash and derivative products that we broker. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Rates volumes in particular are influenced by
market volumes and volatility. Historically low and negative interest rates across the globe have significantly reduced the overall trading appetite for rates products. The ECB and Bank of Japan are among a number of central banks that have cut key
interest rates to below zero, while many sovereign bonds continue to trade at negative yields.. The U.K.&#146;s referendum vote to exit the European Union drove historically low yields even lower in 2016 compared with the two prior years, as a
subsequent flight to high quality and deeply liquid asset classes ensued. Although the election results in the U.S. resulted in yields rising above long-term lows during the fourth quarter of 2016 in many major markets, rates volumes were tempered
for the full year 2016 industry-wide by this continuing period of exceptionally low interest rates. These historically low yields have driven many traditional investor classes to other investible asset classes in search of higher yields. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also weighing on yields and rates volumes are global central bank quantitative easing programs.
The programs depress rates volumes because they entail the central banks buying government securities or other securities in the open market &#151; particularly longer-dated instruments &#151; in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity
and bring down long-term interest rates. When central banks hold these instruments, they tend not to trade or hedge, thus lowering rates volumes across cash and derivatives markets industry-wide. Despite the conclusion of its quantitative easing
program in the fourth quarter of 2014, the U.S. Federal Reserve still had approximately $3.7 trillion worth of long-dated U.S. Treasury and Federal Agency securities as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, compared with $1.7 trillion at the beginning of 2011
and zero prior to September 2008. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve has continued to roll over its existing positions and it is expected to keep its balance sheet at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. Other major central banks have
also greatly increased the amount of longer-dated debt on their balance sheets over the past few years and have indicated that they may continue to do so until economic conditions allow for a tapering or an unwinding of their quantitative easing
programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">G-20</FONT> central banks have agreed to implement the Basel III accord.
Basel III was drafted with the intention of making banks more stable in the wake of the financial crisis. The accord, which will continue to be phased in over the coming years, will force most large banks in
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">G-20</FONT> nations to hold approximately three times as much Tier 1 capital as is required under the previous set of rules. These capital rules make it more expensive for banks to hold
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-sovereign</FONT> debt assets on their balance sheets, and as a result, analysts say that banks have reduced or will reduce their trading activity in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as
in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. We believe that this has further reduced overall industry volumes in many of the products we broker, particularly in credit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;1, 2016, the U.S. and Japan implemented &#147;Phase I&#148; of the Basel Committee&#146;s edict for initial margin and
variation margins to be exchanged bilaterally between participants transacting in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-centrally</FONT> cleared derivatives. &#147;Phase I&#148; adversely impacted trading activity at our large sell-side institutional
clients during the third quarter of 2016 as they worked through arranging documentation to support the exchange of margins with each other. Some clients remain unable to deal with major counterparties. In addition, uncertainty around compliance
globally has affected derivatives pricing. <B></B>Although regulators in Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia previously announced delays to the &#147;Phase I&#148; implementation date, most uncleared bilateral rates, FX and credit derivatives
trading with U.S. counterparties has necessarily included initial margin, resulting in a general widening of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bid-offer</FONT> spreads with subsequent reduced turnover. While there has been some substitution with
trades in nearly similar products being submitted for central clearing so as to be out of scope for the new rule, these transactions did not replace the withdrawn volumes. The first tranche of this rule application in the EU will occur in the middle
of the first quarter of 2017, and similar disruption may occur as the aftermath may be spread across a wider set of participants. &#147;Phases II and III,&#148; which cover midsize and smaller institutions, are expected to be implemented over the
next four years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, industry volumes were generally mixed year-over-year for the OTC and
listed products we broker in rates, credit, FX, equities, energy and commodities. Below is an expanded discussion of the volume and growth drivers of our various financial services brokerage product categories. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Rates Volumes and Volatility </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our rates business is influenced by a number of factors, including global sovereign issuances, secondary trading and the hedging of these
sovereign debt instruments. While the amount of global sovereign debt outstanding remains high by historical standards, the level of secondary trading and related hedging activity remained somewhat muted for most of 2016. For example, according to
Trax, total European fixed income volumes were down 2% during 2016 as compared with a year earlier. In addition, according to Bloomberg and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average daily volume of various U.S. Treasuries, excluding Treasury
bills, among primary dealers was flat during 2016 as compared with a year earlier. Additionally, interest rate volumes were up 3% at Eurex, and up 12% for both ICE and the CME Group Inc. (&#147;CME&#148;), all according to Credit Suisse Research. In
comparison, our overall rates revenues were approximately flat as compared to a year earlier. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our rates revenues, like the revenues for
most of our Financial Services products, are not totally dependent on market volumes and therefore do not always fluctuate consistently with industry metrics. This is largely because our voice, hybrid, and fully electronic desks in rates often have
volume discounts built into their price structure, which results in our rates revenues being less volatile than the overall industry volumes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Overall, analysts and economists expect the absolute level of sovereign debt outstanding to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable
future as governments finance their future deficits and roll over their sizable existing debt. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the &#147;OECD&#148;), which includes almost all of the advanced and developed
economies of the world, reported that general government debt as a percentage of GDP is estimated to remain at 73% for the entire OECD in 2018. This would represent a slight increase from 71% in 2015, but up considerably from the 39% figure in 2007.
Meanwhile, economists expect that the effects of various forms of quantitative easing will continue to negatively impact financial markets, as economic growth remains weak in most OECD countries. As a result, we expect long-term tailwinds in our
rates business from continuing high levels of government debt, but continued near-term headwinds due to the current low interest rate environment and continued accommodative monetary policy of many major central banks. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Global FX volumes were generally down during 2016, as the year was impacted by decreased market volatility due to increased uncertainty around
global macro events, including upcoming Brexit negotiations. Thus, spot FX at Thomson Reuters was down 10% during the year, overall FX volumes were down 6% for EBS, while FX futures at CME were down 2%. In comparison, our overall FX revenues
decreased by 6.6% to $303.3&nbsp;million, primarily related to the challenging market conditions described above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Credit Volumes
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The cash portion of our credit business is impacted by the level of global corporate bond issuance, while both the cash and credit
derivatives sides of this business are impacted by sovereign and corporate issuance. The global credit derivative market turnover has declined over the last few years due to the introduction of rules and regulations around the clearing of credit
derivatives in the U.S. and elsewhere, along with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-uniform</FONT> regulation across different geographies.&nbsp;In addition, many of our large bank customers continue to reduce their inventory of bonds and other
credit products in order to comply with Basel III and other international financial regulations. During 2016, primary dealer average daily volume for corporate bonds was up by 4.0% according to Bloomberg and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
although dealer inventory of such bonds was down 16%. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, total gross and net notional credit derivatives outstanding as reported by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association &#151; a reflection of the OTC
derivatives market &#151; were down by 16% and 12%, respectively, from a year earlier. In comparison, our overall credit revenues were up by 7.4% to $291.8&nbsp;million, while our fully electronic credit revenues were up over 25.8%, driven largely
by organic growth, the addition of GFI and conversion of voice/hybrid volumes to electronic. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Energy and Commodities </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Energy and commodities volumes were generally up during 2016, driven by the increased volatility exhibited in global oil and other physical
commodity prices. Energy and commodities futures average daily volumes during the year were up 7% and 18% year-over-year at ICE and CME, respectively. BGC&#146;s energy and commodities revenues were up 13.6% to $222.9&nbsp;million. Our commodities
revenues increased largely due to the addition of GFI and organic growth. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Equities and Other Asset Classes </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Global equity volumes were generally mixed during 2016. According to Credit Suisse Research, the average daily volumes of U.S. and European
shares were up 7% and down 10%, respectively.&nbsp;Additionally, equity derivatives average daily volumes were down 1% as compared to 2015. Our overall revenues from equities and other asset classes increased by 1.5% to $175.0&nbsp;million, due
largely to the addition of GFI. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Fully Electronic Trading (FENICS) and Hybrid Trading </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, technology-based product growth has led to higher margins and greater profits over time for exchanges and wholesale financial
intermediaries alike, even if overall company revenues remain consistent. This is largely because fewer employees are needed to process the same volume of trades as trading becomes more automated. Over time, electronification of exchange-traded and
OTC markets has also led, on average, to volumes increasing somewhat faster than commissions decline, and thus often to an overall increase in revenues. We have been a pioneer in creating and encouraging hybrid and fully electronic trading, and we
continually work with our customers to expand such trading across more asset classes and geographies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside of U.S. Treasuries and spot
FX, the banks and broker-dealers that dominate the OTC markets had generally been hesitant in adopting electronically traded products. However, in recent years, hybrid and fully electronic wholesale OTC markets for products, including credit
derivative indices, FX options, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, and interest rate derivatives, have been created as banks and broker-dealers have become more open to electronically traded products
and as firms like BGC have invested in the kinds of technology favored by our customers. Recently enacted and pending regulation in Asia, Europe and the U.S. regarding banking, capital markets, and OTC derivatives has accelerated the adoption of
fully electronic trading, and we expect to benefit from the rules and regulations surrounding OTC derivatives.&nbsp;Our understanding is that the rules that have been adopted or are being finalized will continue to allow for trading through a
variety of means, including voice, and we believe the net impact of these rules and additional bank capital requirements will encourage the growth of fully electronic trading for a number of products we broker. We also believe that new clients,
beyond our large bank customer base, will primarily transact electronically across our FENICS platform. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The combination of more market
acceptance of hybrid and fully electronic trading and our competitive advantage in terms of technology and experience has contributed to our strong gains in electronically traded products. We continue to invest in hybrid and fully electronic
technology broadly across our financial services product categories. FENICS has exhibited significant growth over the past several years, and we believe that this growth has outpaced the financial technology and wholesale brokerage industry as a
whole. We expect this trend to continue as we convert more of our voice and hybrid brokerage into fully electronic brokerage across our FENICS platform. </P>

year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, as compared with $192.0&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The increase in overall FENICS revenues for the period was primarily driven by the addition of GFI and strong growth from market data,
post-trade, and fully electronic credit. We offer electronically traded products on a significant portion of our Financial Services segment&#146;s hundreds of brokerage desks. The revenues, profits, and long-term growth of these products have been
significantly higher than those of eSpeed, which we sold in the second quarter of 2013 for over $1.2&nbsp;billion. We expect the proportion of desks offering electronically traded products to continue to increase as we invest in technology to drive
electronic trading over our platform. Over time, we expect the growth of FENICS to further improve this segment&#146;s profitability and market share. </P>

financial results for &#147;Newmark Grubb Knight Frank,&#148; &#147;NGKF,&#148; or &#147;Real Estate Services&#148; reflects only those businesses owned by us and does not include the results for Knight Frank or for the independently owned offices
that use some variation of the NGKF name in their branding or marketing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Real Estate Services segment continued to show solid growth
and generated approximately 40.5% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. Real Estate brokerage revenues were $858.0&nbsp;million, up 6.1% year-over-year, which included growth in real estate capital markets of 27.9%,
partially offset by decreased leasing and other services revenue of 4.8%. The growth across our capital markets business was driven by strong double-digit organic growth, while the decreases in our leasing and other services business reflected lower
market volumes. Our Real Estate management services were up by 5.2%, and overall NGKF revenues improved by 6.0%. Although U.S. industry-wide activity across commercial leasing and capital markets was down by over 10% in the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2016, according to NGKF Research, we believe that NGKF continued to gain market share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We continued to invest in the
Real Estate Services segment by adding dozens of high profile and talented brokers and other revenue-generating professionals. Historically, newly hired commercial real estate brokers tend to achieve dramatically higher productivity in their second
and third years with the Company, although we incur related expenses immediately. This is largely why NGKF&#146;s <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-tax</FONT> earnings were down for the segment in the year. As our newly-hired brokers increase
their production, we expect NGKF&#146;s revenue and earnings growth to improve, thus demonstrating our operating leverage. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over time, we
expect the overall profitability of our Real Estate Services business to increase as we develop its size and scale. However, the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-tax</FONT> margins in the segment are also impacted by the mix of revenues
generated by NGKF. For example, real estate capital markets, which includes sales, commercial mortgage broking, and other real estate-related financial services, generally has larger transactions that occur with less frequency and more seasonality
when compared with leasing advisory. However, real estate capital markets tend to have significantly higher <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-tax</FONT> margins than NGKF as a whole. Leasing advisory revenues are generally more predictable than
revenues from real estate capital markets, while <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-tax</FONT> earnings margins tend to be more similar to those of the segment as a whole. Property and facilities management, which together are called &#147;real
estate management services,&#148; generally have the most predictable and steady revenues, but with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-tax</FONT> earnings margins below those for NGKF as a whole. When management services clients agree to give us
exclusive rights to provide real estate services for their facilities or properties, it is for an extended period of time, which provides us with stable and foreseeable sources of revenues. </P>

specifically designed to meet these objectives. GCS is often hired to solve business problems, not &#147;real estate&#148; problems. GCS provides a unique lens into the corporate real estate (which we refer to as &#147;CRE&#148;) outsourcing

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The key drivers of revenue growth for U.S. commercial real estate services companies include the overall health of the U.S. economy, including
gross domestic product and employment trends in the U.S., which drives demand for various types of commercial leases and purchases, the institutional ownership of commercial real estate as an investible asset class, and the ability to attract and
retain talent to our real estate services platform. In addition, in real estate sales, also known as real estate capital markets, growth is driven by the availability of credit to purchasers of and investors in commercial real estate. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. economy expanded by a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.9% during 2016, which was below the 2.2% growth that had been expected,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. This growth compares with an increase of 2.6% during 2015. The consensus is for U.S. GDP to expand by 2.3% in both 2017 and 2018, according to the same Bloomberg survey of economists. This moderate pace
of growth should help keep interest rates and inflation low by historical standards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that
employers added a monthly average of 148,000 net new payroll jobs during the fourth quarter, which was below the prior year period&#146;s 277,000. U.S. employers added 157,000 jobs in December of 2016, versus the full-year, seasonally adjusted
average of 187,000 per month. Despite the return to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-recession</FONT> unemployment rates (4.7% as of December 2016), the number of long-term unemployed and the labor force participation rate (the latter of which
is near a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">38-year</FONT> low) remain disappointing for many economists, but these indicators are less important to commercial real estate than job creation. </P>

However, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-year</FONT> Treasury yields have remained well below their <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">50-year</FONT> average of approximately 6.5%, in large part due to market expectations that the Federal Open
Market Committee (&#147;FOMC&#148;) will only moderately raise the federal funds rate over the next few years. Interest rates are also low due to even lower or negative benchmark government interest rates in much of the rest of developed world,
which makes U.S. government bonds relatively more attractive. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The combination of moderate economic growth and low interest rates that has been in place since
the recession ended has been a powerful stimulus for commercial real estate, delivering steady absorption of space and strong investor demand for the yields available through both direct ownership of assets and publicly traded funds. Steady economic
growth and low interest rates have helped push vacancy rates down for the office, apartment, retail and industrial markets over the current economic expansion, now in its eighth year. Construction activity, though it is ramping up, remains low
compared with prior expansion cycles and low relative to demand and absorption, which means that property leasing markets continue to tighten. The exception to this trend is apartments, where construction activity has caught up with demand in some
markets and submarkets. Asking rental rates posted moderate gains across all property types during 2016. The following trends drove the commercial real estate market during 2016: </P>

beyond. The administration&#146;s proposed tax cuts and infrastructure spending plans could lift growth, along with leasing activity. Rising inflation and interest rates, a byproduct of faster growth, could deliver a mixed outcome: Rising interest
rates could pressure cap rates, but stronger rent growth and sustained investor demand could support property values. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Market
Statistics </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S commercial property market continues to display strength, despite slowing growth of commercial property prices,
as per CoStar. According to Real Capital Analytics (&#147;RCA&#148;), U.S. commercial real estate sales volumes decreased year-over-year for only the second time since 2009. U.S. commercial real estate activity and prices were impacted during the
year primarily related to tightening credit conditions, particularly in CMBS, as well as changing capitalization rates. However, spreads of U.S. commercial real estate capitalization rates over <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-year</FONT> U.S.
Treasuries were 454 basis points on average over 2016, well above the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-recession</FONT> low of 165 basis points and the trailing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-year</FONT> average spread of 407 basis points.
If the U.S. economy continues to expand at the moderate pace envisioned by many economists, we would expect this to fuel the continued expansion of demand for commercial real estate. The spread between local
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-year</FONT> benchmark government bonds and U.S. cap rates was even wider with respect to major countries including Japan, Canada, Germany, the U.K. and France during 2016. This should continue to make U.S.
commercial real estate a relatively attractive investment for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> investors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to
CoStar&#146;s Value-Weighted U.S. Composite Index, average prices were up by 6.8% year-over-year for the twelve months ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. During the year, the dollar volume of significant property sales totaled approximately
$489&nbsp;billion in the U.S., down by 11% from the year ago period according to RCA. In comparison, our real estate capital markets revenue increased by 28% year-over-year, primarily due to organic growth. </P>

consecutive quarters of improving average vacancy rates. Rents for all property types in the U.S. continued to improve modestly. According to NGKF Research, leasing activity during the year was down slightly from the year ago period, likely a result
of lower corporate earnings in the past several quarters. In comparison, revenues from our leasing and other services business decreased by 4.8%. </P>

year ago to approximately $620&nbsp;thousand. Our average revenue per front-office employee has historically declined year-over-year for the period immediately following significant headcount increases, and the additional brokers and salespeople
generally achieve significantly higher productivity levels in their second or third year with the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The laws and regulations

these developments will favor the larger inter-dealer brokers over smaller, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-public</FONT> local competitors, as the smaller players generally do not have the financial resources to invest the necessary amounts in
technology. We believe this will lead to further consolidation across the wholesale financial brokerage industry, and thus allow us to profitably grow our front-office headcount. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We earn revenues from our voice brokerage services on both an agency and matched principal basis. In agency transactions, we charge a
commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other material terms of the transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and
leave them to settle the trade directly. Principal transaction revenues are primarily derived from matched principal transactions, whereby revenues are earned on the spread between the buy and the sell price of the brokered security, commodity or
derivative. Customers either see the buy or sell price on a screen or are given this information over the phone. The brokerage fee is then added to the buy or sell price, which represents the spread we earn as principal transactions revenues. On a
limited basis, we enter into unmatched principal transactions to facilitate a customer&#146;s execution needs for transactions initiated by such customers. We also provide market data products for selected financial institutions. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We generate interest income primarily from the investment of our daily cash balances, interest earned on securities owned and reverse
repurchase agreements. These investments and transactions are generally short-term in nature. We also earn interest income from employee loans, and we earn dividend income on certain marketable securities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Other Revenues </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We earn
other revenues from various sources including underwriting fees and litigation settlements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Expenses </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Compensation and Employee Benefits </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The majority of our operating costs consist of cash and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> compensation expenses, which include
base salaries, broker bonuses based on broker production, guaranteed bonuses, other discretionary bonuses, and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of brokers, executives and other administrative support. The majority of
our brokers receive a base salary and a formula bonus based primarily on a pool of brokers&#146; production for a particular product or sales desk, as well as on the individual broker&#146;s performance. Members of our sales force receive either a
base salary or a draw on commissions. Less experienced salespeople typically receive base salaries and bonuses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of our
compensation plans certain employees are granted limited partnership units in BGC Holdings which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, that are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being
provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in FASB guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grant of
exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited
partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination
liability awards under FASB guidance, which requires that we record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our consolidated statements of operations as part of &#147;Compensation
and employee benefits.&#148; The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout amount is included in &#147;Accrued compensation&#148; on our consolidated statements of financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into Class&nbsp;A common stock on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-for-one</FONT></FONT> basis (subject to adjustment). At the time exchangeability is granted, the Company recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in &#147;Allocations
of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
have also awarded Preferred Units. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings are allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the
&#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;), which is deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership
distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class&nbsp;A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not included in our
fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in our
consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these
individuals receive loans which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of time. The forgivable portion of these loans
is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the loan. From time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in
the timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. </P>

services to us. The costs associated with such plans are generally amortized over the period in which they vest. See Note 19&#151;&#147;Compensation&#148; to our consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Other Operating Expenses </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have various other operating expenses. We incur leasing, equipment and maintenance expenses for our affiliates worldwide. We also incur
selling and promotion expenses, which include entertainment, marketing and travel-related expenses. We incur communication expenses for voice and data connections with our clients, clearing agents and general usage; professional and consulting fees
for legal, audit and other special projects; and interest expense related to short-term operational funding needs, and notes payable and collateralized borrowings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Primarily in the U.S., we pay fees to Cantor for performing certain administrative and other support, including charges for occupancy of
office space, utilization of fixed assets and accounting, operations, human resources, legal services and technology infrastructure support. Management believes that these charges are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services rendered.
However, the expenses for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if we had not obtained these services from Cantor. In addition, these charges may not reflect the costs of services we may receive
from Cantor in the future. We incur commissions and floor brokerage fees for clearing, brokerage and other transactional expenses for clearing and settlement services. We also incur various other normal operating expenses. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;11, 2015, we completed the sale of the Trayport Business to ICE. The gain from this transaction is included in &#147;Gain on
divestiture and sale of investments,&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Gains (losses) on equity method investments represent our pro rata share of the net gains (losses) on investments over which we have
significant influence but which we do not control. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Other Income </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other income is comprised of the gains associated with the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">earn-out</FONT> shares related to the Nasdaq
transaction and the movements related to the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mark-to-market</FONT></FONT> and/or hedges on marketable securities that are classified as trading securities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Provision for Income Taxes </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We incur income tax expenses based on the location, legal structure and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of our subsidiaries. Certain
of the Company&#146;s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (&#147;UBT&#148;) in New York City.&nbsp;U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or
loss, with the exception of UBT, rests with the partners (see Note 2&#151;&#147;Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings&#148; for discussion of partnership interests) rather than the partnership entity. The Company&#146;s consolidated
financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on the Company&#146;s allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S. we operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income
taxes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, we had income (loss) from operations before income taxes of $188.3&nbsp;million compared to income (loss) from operations before income taxes of $380.6&nbsp;million in the year earlier period. Excluding the
$391&nbsp;million gain we recorded with respect to our Trayport sale in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, our net income for fully diluted shares improved for the full year 2016. Our strong results were led by business integration synergies,
the improving profitability of our high-margin fully electronic FENICS business, and the highest-ever revenues generated by Newmark Grubb Knight Frank&#146;s real estate capital markets business. Our results include those of GFI beginning on
February&nbsp;27, 2015. Total revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 increased approximately $32.2&nbsp;million to $2,612.6&nbsp;million. This is despite the December 2015 sale of Trayport, which generated $58.6&nbsp;million of net
revenues in 2015. The Company also reduced the number of less productive brokers and salespeople in Financial Services by approximately 120 year-over-year, reducing revenues but increasing profitability.&nbsp;Total expenses decreased approximately
$187.4&nbsp;million to $2,532.5&nbsp;million, due to a $77.7&nbsp;million decrease in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compensation</FONT> expenses, as well as a $109.7&nbsp;million decrease in compensation expenses.&nbsp;We expect our revenues
and earnings to grow over time as we continue to invest our $756.9&nbsp;million of liquidity and to reap the benefits from our recent acquisitions and front-office hires. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to increase productivity per broker and to continue converting voice and hybrid broking
to higher margin fully electronic trading, all of which should lead to increased revenues and profitability. By freeing up capital set aside for regulatory and clearing purposes in connection with the GFI integration, we will also be able to use our
balance sheet more efficiently. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Real Estate Services business&#146; overall revenues grew by approximately 6.0%. This improvement was
led by an almost entirely organic 27.9% increase in revenues from real estate capital markets brokerage. According to Real Capital Analytics, industry-wide U.S. investment sales declined by 11%.&nbsp;We therefore continued to grow faster than the
overall market.&nbsp;As we make accretive acquisitions and profitable hires, we expect to sustain our outperformance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that
BGC&#146;s assets and businesses are worth considerably more than what is reflected in our current share price. Based on recent equity multiples, we think that the market is undervaluing both NGKF and FENICS. We also believe that our stock price
does not accurately reflect the more than $750&nbsp;million of additional Nasdaq shares (based on the February&nbsp;8, 2017 closing price) we anticipate receiving over time, which are not reflected on our balance sheet. We also expect our earnings
to continue to grow as we increase the profitability of GFI, add revenues from our highly profitable fully electronic products, and benefit from the strength of our Real Estate Services business. We anticipate having substantial resources with which
to pay dividends, repurchase shares and/or units, profitably hire, and make accretive acquisitions, all while maintaining or improving our investment grade rating. </P>

balance sheet and business model are not capital intensive. Our assets consist largely of cash, securities owned, marketable securities, collateralized and uncollateralized short-dated receivables and less liquid assets needed to support our
business. Longer-term capital (equity and notes payable) is held to support the less liquid assets and potential capital intensive opportunities. Total assets at December&nbsp;31, 2016 were $3.5&nbsp;billion, a decrease of 11.8% as compared to
December&nbsp;31, 2015. The decrease in total assets was driven primarily by decreases in receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers, as well as decreases in marketable securities. We maintain a
significant portion of our assets in cash and marketable securities, with our liquidity (which we define as cash and cash equivalents, reverse repurchase agreements, marketable securities and securities owned) at December&nbsp;31, 2016 of
$756.9&nbsp;million. See &#147;Liquidity Analysis&#148; below for a further discussion of our liquidity. Our securities owned increased to $35.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2016, compared to $32.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31,
2015.&nbsp;Our marketable securities decreased to $164.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2016, compared to $650.4&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2015, primarily as the result of the sale of ICE shares; the sale of ICE shares did not impact our
overall liquidity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;23, 2015, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized management to enter into a revolving credit
facility with Cantor of up to $150&nbsp;million in aggregate principal amount pursuant to which Cantor or BGC would be entitled to borrow funds from each other from time to time. The outstanding balances would bear interest at the higher of the
borrower&#146;s or the lender&#146;s short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 1%. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of our cash management process, we may enter into <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tri-party</FONT> reverse repurchase agreements and
other short-term investments, some of which may be with Cantor. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, Cantor facilitated reverse repurchase agreements on our behalf, and consequently we had $54.7&nbsp;million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding
with Cantor. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, in August 2013, the Audit Committee authorized us to invest up to $350&nbsp;million in an asset-backed
commercial paper program for which certain Cantor entities serve as placement agent and referral agent. The program issues short-term notes to money market investors and is expected to be used from time to time as a liquidity management vehicle. The
notes are backed by assets of highly rated banks. We are entitled to invest in the program so long as the program meets investment policy guidelines, including policies relating to ratings. Cantor will earn a spread between the rate it receives from
the short-term note issuer and the rate it pays to us on any investments in this program. This spread will be no greater than the spread earned by Cantor for placement of any other commercial paper note in the program. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016,
we had no investments in the program. </P>

of specific assets and/or our business model, such as matched fails and accrued compensation. We have limited need for short-term unsecured funding in our regulated entities for their brokerage business. Contingent liquidity needs are largely
limited to potential cash collateral that may be needed to meet clearing bank, clearinghouse, and exchange margins and/or to fund fails. Capital expenditures tend to be cash neutral and approximately in line with depreciation. Current cash balances
significantly exceed our unsecured letters of credit and our unsecured bank borrowings. We believe that cash in and available to our largest regulated entities, inclusive of financing provided by clearing banks, is adequate for potential cash
demands of normal operations, such as margin or fail financing. We expect our operating activities going forward to generate adequate cash flows to fund normal operations, including any dividends paid pursuant to our dividend policy. However, we
believe that there are a significant number of capital intensive opportunities for us to maximize our growth and strategic position, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures potentially involving all types

adjustment in certain circumstances. On July&nbsp;13, 2016, certain holders of the 4.50% Convertible Notes converted $68,000 in principal amount of notes, and, upon conversion, the Company delivered 6,909 shares of its Class&nbsp;A common stock to

effect of downgrades to the credit rating of GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes, the 8.375% Senior Notes were previously subjected to 200 basis points penalty interest. On April&nbsp;28, 2015, a subsidiary of the Company purchased from GFI approximately
43.0&nbsp;million newly issued shares of GFI&#146;s common stock. This increased BGC&#146;s ownership to approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock and gave us the ability to control the timing and process with respect to a full
merger, which as discussed in Note 1&#151;&#147;Organization and Basis of Presentation&#148; to our consolidated financial statements, was completed on January&nbsp;12, 2016. Also on July&nbsp;10, 2015, we guaranteed the obligations of GFI under
these 8.375% Senior Notes. These actions resulted in upgrades of the credit ratings of the 8.375% Senior Notes by Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings Inc. and Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor&#146;s, which reduced the penalty interest to 25 basis

to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. Cantor purchased $15&nbsp;million of such senior notes and still holds such notes as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. The initial carrying value of the 5.125%
Senior Notes was $295.8&nbsp;million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs of $4.2&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Collateralized Borrowings
</I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;13, 2015, the Company entered into a secured loan arrangement of $28.2&nbsp;million under which it pledged certain fixed
assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.70% and matures on March&nbsp;13, 2019. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company had $16.2&nbsp;million outstanding related to this secured loan arrangement, which
includes $0.2&nbsp;million of deferred financing costs. The value of the fixed assets pledged as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 was $3.6&nbsp;million. </P>

part of the GFI acquisition, we assumed a credit agreement as amended (the &#147;GFI Credit Agreement&#148;) with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders, which provided for maximum revolving loans of up to $75.0&nbsp;million. We repaid the
amount outstanding on October&nbsp;2, 2015, prior to the sale of our Trayport division. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&nbsp;1, 2015, we entered into a
previously authorized $150.0&nbsp;million revolving credit facility (the &#147;Facility&#148;) with Cantor and borrowed $100.0&nbsp;million under such facility (the &#147;Cantor Loan&#148;). The Cantor Loan bears interest at the rate of LIBOR plus
3.25% and may be adjusted based on Cantor&#146;s short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 1%. The Facility has a maturity date of August&nbsp;10, 2017. The Cantor Loan was repaid on December&nbsp;31, 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;24, 2015, we entered into a committed unsecured credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. The credit agreement provided for
maximum revolving loans of $25.0&nbsp;million through March&nbsp;24, 2016. The interest rate on this facility was LIBOR plus 200 basis points. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;25, 2016, we entered into a committed unsecured credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a
syndicate of lenders. Several of our domestic <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-regulated</FONT> subsidiaries are parties to the credit agreement as guarantors. The credit agreement provides for revolving loans of $150.0&nbsp;million, with the
option to increase the aggregate loans to $200.0&nbsp;million. The maturity date of the facility is February&nbsp;25, 2018. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at either LIBOR or a defined base rate plus an additional margin which ranges
from 50 basis points to 250 basis points depending on our debt rating as determined by S&amp;P and Fitch and whether such loan is a LIBOR loan or a base rate loan. Contemporaneously with the closing of this credit agreement, the $25.0&nbsp;million
unsecured credit agreement entered into on December&nbsp;24, 2015 with Bank of America, N.A. was terminated. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under either this $150.0&nbsp;million facility or the terminated
$25.0&nbsp;million facility. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financing, including public and
private sales of debt securities, to finance our business, operations and possible acquisitions. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to:
operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base,
available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm&#146;s competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides
that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are
able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain
agreements, we may be required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit ratings downgrade. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We consider our liquidity to be comprised of the sum of Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse repurchase agreements, and Marketable securities,
which have not been financed, and Securities owned. The discussion below describes the key components of our liquidity analysis, including earnings, dividends and distributions, net investing and funding activities, including repurchases and
redemptions of Class&nbsp;A common stock and partnership units, security settlements, changes in securities held and marketable securities, and changes in our working capital. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We consider the following in analyzing changes in our liquidity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our liquidity analysis includes a comparison of our consolidated net income (loss) adjusted for certain
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> items (e.g., grants of exchangeability) as presented on the cash flow statement. Dividends and distributions are payments made to our holders of common shares and limited partnership interests and are
related to earnings from prior periods. These timing differences will impact our cash flows in a given period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our investing and funding
activities represent a combination of our capital raising activities, including short-term borrowings and repayments, issuances of shares under our controlled equity offerings (net), Class&nbsp;A common stock repurchases and partnership unit
redemptions, purchases and sales of securities, dispositions, and other investments (e.g. acquisitions, forgivable loans to new brokers and capital expenditures&#151;all net of depreciation and amortization). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our securities settlement activities primarily represent deposits with clearing organizations. In addition, when advantageous, we may elect to
facilitate the settlement of matched principal transactions by funding failed trades, which results in a temporary secured use of cash and is economically beneficial to us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other changes in working capital represent changes primarily in receivables and payables and accrued liabilities that impact our liquidity.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Changes in Reverse repurchase agreements, Securities owned and Marketable securities may result from additional cash investments or
sales, which will be offset by a corresponding change in Cash and cash equivalents and accordingly will not result in a change in our liquidity. Conversely, changes in the market value of such securities and the receipt of the Nasdaq <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">earn-out</FONT> in the form of additional Nasdaq shares are reflected in our earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) and will result in changes in our liquidity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Company had $502.0&nbsp;million of Cash and cash equivalents, and included in this amount was
$281.2&nbsp;million of Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries.&nbsp;With the exception of the cash proceeds from the sale of Trayport, it is our intention to permanently reinvest undistributed foreign
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-tax</FONT> earnings in the Company&#146;s foreign operations.&nbsp;It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax that may be payable in the event these earnings are repatriated due to the
fluctuation of the relative ownership percentages of the foreign subsidiaries between the Company and BGC Holdings, L.P. For these proceeds which are not permanently reinvested, the accrued tax liability is $135.5&nbsp;million, net of foreign tax
credits.&nbsp;In addition, certain GFI net operating loss carryforwards are expected to be utilized to reduce cash taxes.&nbsp;Taking these items together, we therefore expect to pay effective cash taxes of no more than $64&nbsp;million related to
the Trayport sale price, or an expected rate of less than 10%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Discussion of the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 </I></B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our liquidity and available cash resources are restricted by regulatory requirements of our Financial Services operating subsidiaries. Many of
these regulators, including U.S. and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings
that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">cease-and-desist</FONT></FONT> orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer. In addition, self-regulatory organizations,
such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#147;FINRA&#148;) and the National Futures Association (&#147;NFA&#148;), along with statutory bodies such as the Financial Conduct Authority (&#147;FCA&#148;), the SEC, and the CFTC require
strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with broker-dealers and are not
designed to specifically protect stockholders. These regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FCA is the relevant statutory regulator in the United Kingdom. The FCA&#146;s objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability
of the financial services industry and promote competition between financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative
legislation and regulations. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by
the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do business. Additionally, certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> net capital requirements. In Hong Kong, BGC
Securities (Hong Kong), LLC and GFI (HK) Securities LLC are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission. BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited and GFI (HK) Brokers Ltd are regulated by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All are subject to
Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC and BGC France Holdings; in Australia, BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited, BGC (Securities) Pty Limited and GFI Australia Pty Ltd.; in Japan, BGC Shoken Kaisha Limited&#146;s Japanese
branch; in Singapore, BGC Partners (Singapore) Limited, BGC Securities (Singapore) Ltd and GFI Group PTE Ltd; in Korea, BGC Capital Markets&nbsp;&amp; Foreign Exchange Broker (Korea) Limited and GFI Korea Money Brokerage Limited; and in Turkey, BGC
Partners Menkul Degerler AS, all have net capital requirements imposed upon them by local regulators. In addition, the LCH (LIFFE/LME) clearing organization, of which BGC L.P. is a member, also imposes minimum capital requirements. In Latin America,
BGC Liquidez Distribuidora De Titulos E Valores Mobiliarios Ltda. (Brazil) has net capital requirements imposed upon it by local regulators. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, these subsidiaries may be prohibited from repaying the borrowings of their parents or affiliates, paying cash dividends, making
loans to their parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions, in each case, that result in a significant reduction in their regulatory capital position without prior notification or approval from their principal regulator. See Note
22&#151;&#147;Regulatory Requirements,&#148; to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our regulatory requirements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, $543.8&nbsp;million of net assets were held by regulated subsidiaries. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, these
subsidiaries had aggregate regulatory net capital, as defined, in excess of the aggregate regulatory requirements, as defined, of $283.7&nbsp;million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, our Board of Directors and Audit Committee authorized management to enter into indemnification agreements with Cantor and its
affiliates with respect to the provision of any guarantees provided by Cantor and its affiliates from time to time as required by regulators. These services may be provided from time to time at a reasonable and customary fee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, began operating as SEFs on October&nbsp;2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets
and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on January&nbsp;22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for &#147;made available to
trade&#148; products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. We also own ELX, a CFTC-approved DCM. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Much of our global derivatives volumes continue to be executed by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-U.S.</FONT> based clients outside the
U.S. and subject to local prudential regulations. As such, we also continue to operate five Multilateral Trading Facilities (&#147;MTFs&#148;) in accordance with EU directives as licensed by the FCA. The final draft of the Markets in Financial
Instruments Directive II (&#147;MiFID II&#148;) was published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (&#147;ESMA&#148;) in September 2015, and implementation is now expected to commence in January 2018. MiFID II will have a particularly
significant impact in a number of key areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-</FONT> and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection. MiFID
II will also introduce a new regulated execution venue category known as the Organized Trading Facility, and there is currently expected to be a joint equivalence assessment by EU and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-EU</FONT> jurisdictions for
granting mutual access to each other&#146;s domestic marketplaces. MiFID II may require us to carry out internal reorganizations and possibly apply for additional licenses. In addition, the June&nbsp;23, 2016 U.K. referendum vote to leave the
European Union and recent announcement that the UK Government will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty (thereby setting in motion the timetable for the U.K. to leave the E.U.) may impact future market structure and MiFID II rulemaking and
implementation due to potential changes in mutual passporting between the U.K. and EU Member States. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">See &#147;Regulation&#148; in Part

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Discretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense is comprised of discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in
cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary
bonuses, actual results may differ. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Restricted Stock Units: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition
provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) guidance. Restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and as per FASB guidance, we are required to record an
expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. FASB guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Because significant assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock.
Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected
dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards&#146; vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a
straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations. </P>

required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance
with our and our affiliates&#146; customary noncompete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in five to ten years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the
grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Limited Partnership Units: Limited partnership units in BGC Holdings are generally held by
employees. Generally, such units receive quarterly allocations of net income, which are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. Our Preferred Units are not entitled to
participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. As prescribed in FASB guidance, the
quarterly allocations of net income to such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in our
consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination
payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under FASB guidance. Accordingly, we recognize a
liability for these units on our consolidated statements of financial condition as part of &#147;Accrued compensation&#148; for the amortized portion of the post-termination payment amount, based on the current fair value of the expected future cash
payout. We amortize the post-termination payment amount, less an expected forfeiture rate, over the vesting period, and record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period in our consolidated statements of
operations as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into
Class&nbsp;A common stock on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-for-one</FONT></FONT> basis (subject to adjustment). At the time exchangeability is granted, we recognize an expense based on the fair value of the
award on that date, which is included in &#147;Allocations of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and
2014, we incurred compensation expense of $141.4&nbsp;million, $231.4&nbsp;million and $126.5&nbsp;million, respectively, related to the grant of exchangeability on partnership units. The 2015 amount includes a conversion of 90% of outstanding REUs

employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of
time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these advances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and future
awards granted. The distributions are treated as compensation expense when made and the proceeds are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations over
the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances. Actual
collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016 and December&nbsp;31, 2015, the aggregate
balance of employee loans, net of reserve, was $267.5&nbsp;million and $158.2&nbsp;million, respectively, and is included as &#147;Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net&#148; in our consolidated statements of
financial condition. Compensation expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $55.8&nbsp;million, $86.7&nbsp;million (including a $47.2&nbsp;million reserve) and $25.7&nbsp;million,
respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. </P>

is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in FASB guidance, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically
tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-step</FONT> process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first step involves comparing each reporting unit&#146;s estimated fair value
with its carrying value, including goodwill. To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of
significant estimates and assumptions. These assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because significant assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future
cash flows, choosing peer companies and selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is
deemed not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment. </P>

implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated a potential impairment may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as
calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identified </P>

intangibles. Events such as economic weakness, significant declines in operating results of reporting units, or significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g.,

the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of our entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (&#147;UBT&#148;) in
the City of New York. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners (see Note 2&#151;&#147;Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings&#148; for a discussion of partnership
interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners&#146; tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-related</FONT> assets, liabilities, provisions
or benefits included in our consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. Pursuant to FASB guidance on Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement on Accounting for Income Taxes, we provide for uncertain tax positions based upon management&#146;s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax
authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits
of the position. Because significant assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in &#147;Interest expense&#148; and &#147;Other expenses,&#148; respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax
planning strategies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws
and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because our interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">See Note 3&#151;&#147;Summary of Significant Accounting

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit risk arises from potential <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-performance</FONT> by counterparties and customers. BGC
Partners has established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to credit risk. BGC Partners maintains a thorough credit approval process to limit exposure to counterparty risk and employs stringent monitoring to control the counterparty
risk from its matched principal and agency businesses. BGC Partners&#146; account opening and counterparty approval process includes verification of key customer identification, anti-money laundering verification checks and a credit review of
financial and operating data. The credit review process includes establishing an internal credit rating and any other information deemed necessary to make an informed credit decision, which may include correspondence, due diligence calls and a visit
to the entity&#146;s premises, as necessary. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit approval is granted subject to certain trading limits and may be subject to
additional conditions, such as the receipt of collateral or other credit support. Ongoing credit monitoring procedures include reviewing periodic financial statements and publicly available information on the client and collecting data from credit
rating agencies, where available, to assess the ongoing financial condition of the client. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through its subsidiaries, BGC Partners
executes matched principal transactions in which it acts as a &#147;middleman&#148; by serving as counterparty to both a buyer and a seller in matching <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">back-to-back</FONT></FONT>
trades. These transactions are then settled through a recognized settlement system or third-party clearing organization. Settlement typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs
upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. BGC Partners generally avoids settlement of principal transactions on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">free-of-payment</FONT></FONT> basis or
by physical delivery of the underlying instrument. However, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">free-of-payment</FONT></FONT> transactions may occur on a very limited basis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The number of matched principal trades BGC Partners executes has continued to grow as compared to prior years. Receivables from
broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers and Payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition primarily
represent the simultaneous purchase and sale of the securities associated with those matched principal transactions that have not settled as of their stated settlement dates. BGC Partners&#146; experience has been that substantially all of these
transactions ultimately settle at the contracted amounts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, BGC Partners incurs limited credit risk related to certain
brokerage activities. The counterparty risk relates to the collectability of the outstanding brokerage fee receivables. The review process includes monitoring both the clients and the related brokerage receivables. The review includes an evaluation
of the ongoing collection process and an aging analysis of the brokerage receivables. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Market Risk </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses
for a specified position. BGC Partners may allow certain of its desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are primarily for the purpose of
facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, BGC Partners may have market risk exposure on these transactions. BGC Partners&#146; exposure varies based on the size of its
overall positions, the risk characteristics of the instruments held and the amount of time the positions are held before they are disposed of. BGC Partners has limited ability to track its exposure to market risk and unmatched positions on an <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">intra-day</FONT> basis; however, it attempts to mitigate its market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging its exposure. These positions are intended to be held short
term to facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, BGC Partners may not be able to unwind the position and it may be forced to hold the
position for a longer period than anticipated. All positions held longer than <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">intra-day</FONT> are marked to market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have investments in marketable equity securities,
which are publicly-traded, and which had a fair value of $164.8&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. These include shares of common stock of Nasdaq that we received in exchange for a portion of our electronic benchmark Treasury platform and
shares of common stock of ICE that we received in exchange for Trayport. Investments in marketable securities carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that the marketable securities will not lose value and, in general, securities markets
can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of marketable securities could be materially and adversely affected. We may seek to minimize the effect of price changes on a portion of our investments in
marketable securities through the use of derivative contracts. However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with our investments in marketable securities. See Note
10&#151;&#147;Marketable Securities&#148; and Note 12&#151;&#147;Derivatives&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> for further information

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our risk management procedures and strict limits are designed to monitor and limit the risk of
unintended loss and have been effective in the past. However, there is no assurance that these procedures and limits will be effective at limiting unanticipated losses in the future. Adverse movements in the securities positions or a downturn or
disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on BGC Partners&#146;
consolidated financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Operational Risk </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many
currencies on a daily basis. If any of our data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity,
financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our
control, including cybersecurity incidents, a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also
constrain our ability to expand our businesses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, despite our contingency plans, our ability to conduct business may be
adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or
third parties with whom we conduct business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Foreign Currency Risk </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Partners is exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates create volatility in the
U.S.&nbsp;Dollar equivalent of the Company&#146;s revenues and expenses. In addition, changes in the remeasurement of BGC Partners&#146; foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities are recorded as part of its results of operations
and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. BGC monitors the net exposure in foreign currencies on a daily basis and hedges its exposure as deemed appropriate with highly rated major financial institutions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The majority of the Company&#146;s foreign currency exposure is related to the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar versus the British Pound and the
Euro.&nbsp;While our international results of operations, as measured in U.S. Dollars, are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, we do not consider the related risk to be material to our results of operations.&nbsp;For the financial assets and
liabilities denominated in the British Pound and Euro, including foreign currency hedge positions related to these currencies, we evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar, holding all
other assumptions constant.&nbsp;The analysis identified the worst case scenario as the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar weakening against the Euro and the British Pound. If as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar had weakened against the Euro and the
British Pound by 10%, the currency movements would have had an aggregate negative impact on our net income of approximately $8.5&nbsp;million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Interest Rate Risk </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Partners had $965.8&nbsp;million in fixed-rate debt outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. These debt obligations are not currently
subject to fluctuations in interest rates, although in the event of refinancing or issuance of new debt, such debt could be subject to changes in interest rates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have audited BGC Partners, Inc.&#146;s (the &#147;Company&#148;) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria
established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). BGC Partners, Inc.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As indicated in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management&#146;s assessment of and conclusion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Sunrise Brokers Group, Perimeter Markets Inc., Continental Realty and Newmark Grubb Mexico City, which are included in the 2016 consolidated
financial statements of BGC Partners, Inc. and constituted $118.3&nbsp;million or 3.4% of total assets as of December 31, 2016 and $5.1&nbsp;million or 0.2% of total revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting of BGC Partners, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Sunrise Brokers Group, Perimeter Markets Inc., Continental Realty and Newmark Grubb Mexico City. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, BGC Partners, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on
the COSO criteria. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated statements of financial condition of BGC Partners, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2016 of BGC Partners, Inc. and our report dated February 28, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">/s/

Global&#148;), the two operating partnerships. Listed below are the limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings. The founding/working partner units, limited partnership units and limited partnership interests held by Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P.

(&#147;FPUs&#148;) outside of permanent capital, as &#147;Redeemable partnership interest,&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. This classification is applicable to founding/working partner units because these

termination of employment or otherwise ceasing to provide substantive services, the founding/working partner units are generally redeemed, and the unit holders are no longer entitled to participate in the quarterly allocations of net income. Since
these allocations of net income are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and are contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder, they are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grant

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain employees hold limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings (e.g., REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs and LPUs, collectively the &#147;limited
partnership units&#148;). Generally, such units receive quarterly allocations of net income, which are cash distributed and generally are contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in FASB guidance, the quarterly
allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grant of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s
consolidated statements of operations. From time to time, the Company issues limited partnership units as part of the consideration for acquisitions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount of the units
in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards, and in accordance with FASB guidance, the Company records compensation expense for the
awards based on the change in value at each reporting date in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has also awarded certain preferred partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;). Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings
are allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the &#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;). These allocations are deducted before the calculation
and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership
distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not
included in the Company&#146;s fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grant of exchangeability to limited partnership
units and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining partnership units generally receive quarterly allocations of net income based on their weighted-average
pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cantor Units </I></B></P>

the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>General </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of the limited partnership interests, described above, have been granted exchangeability into Class&nbsp;A common stock on a <FONT

<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-for-one</FONT></FONT> basis (subject to adjustment). Because they are included in the Company&#146;s fully diluted share count, if dilutive, any exchange of limited partnership
interests into Class&nbsp;A common shares would not impact the fully diluted number of shares and units outstanding. Because these limited partnership interests generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, such exchange would have no
significant impact on the cash flows or equity of the Company. Each quarter, net income (loss) is allocated between the limited partnership interests and the common stockholders. In quarterly periods in which the Company has a net loss, the loss
allocation for FPUs, limited partnership units and Cantor units is allocated to Cantor and reflected as a component of &#147;Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated
statements of operations. In subsequent quarters in which the Company has net income, the initial allocation of income to the limited partnership interests is to &#147;Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries,&#148;
to recover any losses taken in earlier quarters, with the remaining income allocated to the limited partnership interests. This income (loss) allocation process has no impact on the net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Fixed assets are carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Internal and external direct costs of developing applications and obtaining software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over three years on a straight-line basis. Computer equipment is depreciated
over three to five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated economic useful lives or the remaining lease term. Routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When fixed assets are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the related gain or loss is included in operating income. The Company has asset retirement obligations related to certain of its leasehold improvements, which it accounts for using the FASB guidance, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement cost
is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The liability is discounted and accretion expense is recognized using the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate in effect when the liability was initially recognized. </P>

investments in which it has a significant influence but not a controlling interest and of which it is not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method. The Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company&#146;s policy is to consolidate all entities of which it owns more than 50% unless it does not have control over the entity. In accordance with FASB guidance,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, the Company also consolidates any variable interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;) of which it is the primary beneficiary. </P>

periodically evaluates potential impairment of long-lived assets and amortizable intangibles, when a change in circumstances occurs, by applying the concepts of FASB guidance, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and
assessing whether the unamortized carrying amount can be recovered over the remaining life through undiscounted future expected cash flows generated by the underlying assets. If the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying value of
the asset, an impairment charge would be recorded. The impairment charge would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the
risks involved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed
in FASB guidance, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are periodically tested for impairment. The Company reviews goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. When reviewing goodwill for
impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company performed impairment evaluations for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and concluded that there was no impairment of its goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Definite-lived intangible
assets arising from business combinations include customer relationships, internally developed software, covenants not to compete and trademarks. Also included in the definite-lived intangible assets are purchased patents. The costs of acquired
patents are amortized over a period not to exceed the legal life or the remaining useful life of the patent, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method. </P>

income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in FASB guidance on Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of the Company&#146;s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (&#147;UBT&#148;) in New
York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners (see Note 2&#151; &#147;Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings&#148; for a discussion of partnership
interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners&#146; tax liability or benefit is not reflected in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-related</FONT> assets,
liabilities, provisions or benefits included in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. Pursuant to FASB guidance

Company accounts for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the FASB guidance. Equity-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of equity-based payment awards that
is ultimately expected to vest. The grant-date fair value of equity-based awards is amortized to expense ratably over the awards&#146; vesting periods. As equity-based compensation expense recognized in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of
operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reviewed for estimated forfeitures. Further, FASB guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Restricted Stock Units:</I></B> </P>

affiliate or subsidiary of the Company; however, transferability is subject to compliance with BGC Partners&#146; and its affiliates&#146; customary noncompete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in five
to ten years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal

change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; The liability for limited partnership units with a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;1, 2010, BGC Holdings issued an aggregate of $150.0&nbsp;million principal amount of the 8.75% Convertible Notes to Cantor in a
private placement transaction. The 8.75% Convertible Notes were senior unsecured obligations and ranked equally and ratably with all existing and future senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 8.75% Convertible Notes bore an annual interest
rate of 8.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on April&nbsp;15 and October&nbsp;15 of each year, beginning on October&nbsp;15, 2010. On April&nbsp;13, 2015, the Company&#146;s 8.75% Convertible Notes were fully converted into 24,042,599 shares of
the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued to Cantor. The Company did not record any interest expense related to the 8.75% Convertible Notes for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. The Company recorded
interest expense related to the 8.75% Convertible Notes of $3.8&nbsp;million and $13.1&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;29, 2011, the Company issued an aggregate of $160.0&nbsp;million principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Notes due July&nbsp;15,
2016. The 4.50% Convertible Notes were general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 4.50% Convertible Notes paid interest semiannually at a rate of 4.50% per annum and were priced at par. The Company recorded interest expense related to
the 4.50% Convertible Notes of $6.5&nbsp;million, $12.0&nbsp;million and $11.9&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;13, 2016, certain holders of the 4.50% Convertible Notes converted $68,000 in principal amount of notes, and, upon conversion,
the Company delivered 6,909 shares of its Class&nbsp;A common stock to such holders.&nbsp;On July&nbsp;15, 2016, the Company repaid the remaining approximately $159.9&nbsp;million principal amount of its 4.50% Convertible Notes that matured on
July&nbsp;15, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the offering of the 4.50% Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions,
which were expected to reduce the potential dilution of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock upon any conversion of the 4.50% Convertible Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, as
measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, was greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions. The capped call transactions expired unexercised on July&nbsp;13, 2016. The expiration of the capped call transactions had
no financial statement impact. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Below is a summary of the Company&#146;s Convertible Notes (in thousands, except share and per share

&#147;8.375% Senior Notes&#148;). The carrying value of these notes as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 was $247.0&nbsp;million. Interest on these notes is payable, semi-annually in arrears on the 19th of January and July. Due to the cumulative effect of
downgrades to the credit rating of GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes, the 8.375% Senior Notes were subjected to 200 basis points penalty interest. On April&nbsp;28, 2015, a subsidiary of the Company purchased from GFI approximately 43.0&nbsp;million
new shares of GFI common stock. This increased BGC&#146;s ownership to approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock and gave the Company the ability to control the timing and process with respect to a full merger. Also on July&nbsp;10,
2015, the Company guaranteed the obligations of GFI under the 8.375% Senior Notes. These actions resulted in upgrades of the credit ratings of GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes by Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings Inc. and
Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor&#146;s, which reduced the penalty interest to 25 basis points effective July&nbsp;19, 2015. In addition, on January&nbsp;13, 2016, Moody&#146;s further upgraded the credit rating on GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes,
eliminating the penalty interest. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 8.375% Senior Notes of $20.1&nbsp;million and $19.2&nbsp;million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company did not record any

matters. In light of the competitive nature of the brokerage industry, litigation, claims and arbitration between competitors regarding employee hiring are not uncommon. The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews,
investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies (both formal and informal) regarding the Company&#146;s business. Any such actions may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. </P>

estimate a possible loss or range of loss in connection with specific matters beyond its current accrual and any other amounts disclosed. Management believes that, based on currently available information, the final outcome of these current pending

services to institutional customers and by executing and, in some cases, clearing transactions for institutional counterparties. Revenues for these services are transaction-based. As a result, revenues could vary based on the transaction volume of
global financial and real estate markets. Additionally, financing is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which could have an impact on the Company&#146;s overall profitability. </P>

care claims as of December&nbsp;31, 2016.&nbsp;The Company does not expect the impact of the health care claims to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. </P>

Under these standard securities clearinghouse and exchange membership agreements, members are required to guarantee, collectively, the performance of other members and, accordingly, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the
clearinghouse or exchange, all other members would be required to meet the shortfall. In the opinion of management, the Company&#146;s liability under these agreements is not quantifiable and could exceed the cash and securities it has posted as
collateral. However, the potential of being required to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no contingent liability has been recorded in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition for these

as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. Except for the cash proceeds from the sale of Trayport, it is our intention to permanently reinvest these undistributed foreign <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-tax</FONT> earnings in the Company&#146;s foreign
operations.&nbsp;It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax that may be payable in the event these earnings are repatriated due to the fluctuation of the relative ownership percentages of the foreign subsidiaries between the
Company and BGC Holdings, L.P. For the cash proceeds that are not permanently reinvested, the accrued tax liability is $135.5&nbsp;million, net of foreign tax credits.&nbsp;In addition, certain GFI Group net operating loss carryforwards are expected
to be utilized to reduce cash taxes.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation
allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. </P>

is recorded, processed, accumulated, summarized and communicated to its management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of BGC Partners disclosure controls and
procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that BGC Partners&#146; disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December&nbsp;31,

Exchange Act Rules <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">13a-15(f)</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">15d-15(f).</FONT> Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and
Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2016 based upon criteria set forth in the Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on the results of our 2016 evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

Partners&#146; acquisitions of Sunrise Brokers Group, Perimeter Markets Inc., Continental Realty and Newmark Grubb Mexico City, as these acquisitions were completed during the course of 2016, and did not have a material effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows in 2016.&nbsp;However, we anticipate that these acquisitions will be included in management&#146;s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our audit of internal controls over
financial reporting for 2017.&nbsp;The aggregate 2016 revenues, recognized from the dates of acquisition, represented approximately 0.2% or $5.1&nbsp;million of the Company&#146;s total revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </P>
