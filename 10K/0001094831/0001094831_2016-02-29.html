<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The voice brokerage business within our Financial Services segment originates from one of the oldest and most established inter-dealer
franchises in the financial intermediary industry. Cantor started our wholesale intermediary brokerage operations in 1972. In 1996, Cantor launched its eSpeed system, which revolutionized the way government bonds are traded in the inter-dealer
market by providing a fully electronic trading marketplace. eSpeed, Inc. (&#147;eSpeed&#148;) completed an initial public offering in 1999 and began trading on NASDAQ, yet it remained one of Cantor&#146;s controlled subsidiaries. Following
eSpeed&#146;s initial public offering, Cantor continued to operate its inter-dealer voice brokerage business separately from eSpeed. In August 2004, Cantor announced the reorganization and separation of its inter-dealer voice brokerage business into
a subsidiary called &#147;BGC,&#148; in honor of B. Gerald Cantor, the pioneer in screen brokerage services and fixed income market data products. In April 2008, BGC and certain other Cantor assets merged with and into eSpeed, and the combined
company began operating under the name &#147;BGC Partners, Inc.&#148; In June 2013, BGC sold certain assets relating to its U.S. Treasury benchmark business and the name &#147;eSpeed&#148; to NASDAQ, Inc. (&#147;NASDAQ,&#148; formerly The NASDAQ OMX
Group, Inc.) (see &#147;NASDAQ Transaction&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the events of September11, 2001, our financial brokerage business was widely
recognized as one of the leading full-service wholesale inter-dealer brokers in the world, with a rich history of developing innovative technological and financial solutions. After September&nbsp;11, 2001 and the loss of the majority of our
U.S.-based employees, our voice financial brokerage business operated primarily in Europe. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since the formation of BGC in 2004, we have
substantially rebuilt our U.S. presence and have continued to expand our global footprint through the acquisition and integration of established brokerage companies and the hiring of experienced brokers. Through these actions, we have been able to
expand our presence in key markets and position our Financial Services business for sustained growth. Recent acquisitions include: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

Group Inc. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;26, 2015, we successfully completed our tender offer to acquire shares of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of GFI for $6.10 per share in cash and accepted for purchase 54.3&nbsp;million shares tendered to us pursuant to the offer. The Tendered Shares, together with the 17.1&nbsp;million Shares already owned by us, represented approximately 56%
of the then outstanding shares of GFI. We issued payment for the Tendered Shares on March&nbsp;4, 2015 in the aggregate amount of $331.1 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the tender offer, on February&nbsp;19, 2015, we and one of our subsidiaries entered into a Tender Offer Agreement with GFI
(the &#147;TO Agreement&#148;). Pursuant to the TO Agreement, the board of directors of GFI unanimously agreed to support our tender offer and to expand GFI&#146;s board and our designation of certain members. The TO Agreement also contained
provisions with respect to the terms and timing of the back-end mergers of Jersey Partners Inc. (&#147;JPI&#148;), a stockholder of GFI, and with us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the TO Agreement, GFI&#146;s then Executive Chairman, Michael Gooch, and its then Chief Executive Officer, Colin Heffron, remained
as directors of GFI. Mr.&nbsp;Heffron entered into an amended and restated GFI employment agreement that continues to provide him with certain annual cash and equity compensation and severance arrangements. Mr.&nbsp;Gooch entered into a fixed-term
employment agreement that provides him with certain cash and equity compensation. Pursuant to the TO Agreement, BGC has established a Distributable Earnings Bonus Pool (the &#147;Pool&#148;) program in an amount equal to one times the average annual
distributable earnings (as defined) of the GFI inter-dealer brokerage business for the three successive 12-month periods beginning on July&nbsp;1, 2015. The Pool is in the form of awards of restricted equity units and preferred restricted equity
units of BGC Holdings, L.P and will be allocated 35% to Mr.&nbsp;Gooch, 35% to Mr.&nbsp;Heffron and 30% to other GFI employees as mutually agreed by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron and BGC. As a condition to participation in the Pool, each participant
(including Messrs. Gooch and Heffron) has entered into a non-competition and award agreement containing the terms and conditions of his or her participation, which terms include the participant&#146;s continued employment through July&nbsp;1, 2018
and certain other conditions, obligations and covenants (including non-competition, non-solicitation, non-hire non-disclosure provisions). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;28, 2015, one of our subsidiaries purchased from GFI approximately 43.0&nbsp;million new shares at that date&#146;s closing
price of $5.81 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. The purchase price was paid to GFI in the form of a note due on June&nbsp;19, 2018 that bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points (the &#147;GFI Note&#148;).
Following the issuance of such new shares, we owned approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s then-outstanding common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August&nbsp;24,
2015, GFI, Messrs. Gooch and Heffron; JPI; CME Group, Inc. (&#147;CME&#148;), the former members of the GFI Special Committee, BGC; and certain other former officers and affiliates of GFI entered into a memorandum of understanding (the
&#147;MOU&#148;) with regard to a preliminary settlement (the &#147;Settlement&#148;) of the consolidated class action case pending against GFI in the State of Delaware (the &#147;Consolidated Delaware Action&#148;). Neither GFI nor BGC contributed
any funds to the Settlement, which will be paid from a combination of insurance proceeds and payments by JPI and Messrs. Gooch and Heffron. The Settlement provides for a settlement fund of $10.75 million for the class of GFI stockholders in the
Consolidated Delaware Action and payment of attorneys&#146; fees and costs to plaintiffs&#146; counsel in an amount to be established by negotiation, mediation or a fee application to the Court. The final Settlement will also require approval of the
Court. In connection with the Settlement, on October&nbsp;6, 2015, we advanced $10.75 million to JPI in return for a promissory note (the &#147;JPI Note&#148;). The JPI Note bore interest at the rate of 5.375%&nbsp;per annum and was secured by
two&nbsp;million shares of GFI common stock owned by JPI. The JPI Note was repaid on the date of the Back-End Mergers. In the MOU, the CME agreed to terminate the restriction prohibiting former executive officers of GFI, JPI and certain other
stockholders and affiliates of GFI from supporting the Back-End Mergers. In connection with the Settlement, Messrs. Gooch and Heffron, JPI, BGC and GFI entered into a separate agreement providing for certain matters relating to the merger of BGC and
GFI and allocating certain responsibilities and advancing certain payments (the &#147;Settlement Letter&#148;).The Settlement Letter also included the following agreements: (i)&nbsp;payment of the plaintiffs&#146; attorneys&#146; fees and costs in
the Consolidated Delaware Action first from insurance proceeds, with any excess to be paid by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron; (ii)&nbsp;indemnification by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron with respect to liabilities and expenses in the Consolidated Delaware
Action and other cases related to breach of fiduciary duty or other causes of action, the CME Merger Agreement, insurance claims and the tender offer to the extent not covered by insurance; and (iii)&nbsp;indemnification by Mr.&nbsp;Gooch with
respect to liabilities and expenses in connection with the remaining New York class action case that are not otherwise covered by insurance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;22, 2015, BGC, JPI, New JP Inc. (&#147;New JPI&#148;), Mr.&nbsp;Gooch, Mr.&nbsp;Heffron, and certain subsidiaries of JPI and
BGC entered into a merger agreement providing for the acquisition of JPI by BGC (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;12,
2016, the JPI merger (the &#147;JPI Merger&#148;) was closed. Shortly following the completion of the JPI Merger, a subsidiary of BGC merged with and into GFI pursuant to a short-form merger under Delaware law, with GFI continuing as the surviving
entity (the &#147;GFI Merger&#148; and, together with the JPI Merger, the &#147;Back-End Mergers&#148;). The Back-End Mergers allowed BGC to acquire the remaining approximately 33 percent of the outstanding shares of GFI common stock that BGC did
not already own. Following the closing of the Back-End Mergers, BGC and its affiliates now own 100 percent of the outstanding shares of GFI&#146;s common stock. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, certain subsidiaries of BGC merged with and into a
subsidiary of New JPI, resulting in BGC owning all of the shares of GFI common stock previously owned by JPI. In the JPI Merger, each holder of JPI common stock, other than Messrs. Gooch and Heffron, received per JPI share held an amount equal to
(a)&nbsp;$6.10 multiplied by the number of GFI shares held by JPI, less the principal plus accrued interest on the $10.75 million note issued by JPI to BGC on October&nbsp;6, 2015, divided by (b)&nbsp;the number of outstanding shares of New JPI
common stock. This amount was paid 30 percent in cash and 70 percent in shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock, valued at a price of $9.46 per share of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock, which was the closing price of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock on
the day prior to the date of the TO Agreement. Messrs. Gooch and Heffron received the same amount per JPI share held, subject to certain adjustments, but were paid 100 percent in shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the GFI Merger, each of the remaining outstanding shares of GFI common stock, other than those held by BGC and its subsidiaries, were
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $6.10 per GFI share. Following the closing of the Back-End Mergers, we now own 100% of the shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In total, approximately 23.5&nbsp;million shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock and $111.3 million in cash are expected to have been issued
or paid with respect to the closing of the Back-End Mergers, inclusive of adjustments. The total purchase consideration for all shares of GFI purchased by BGC is expected to be $750.5 million, net of the $250.0 million GFI Note, which is eliminated
in consolidation. This figure excludes the $29.0 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2015 with respect to the appreciation of the 17.1&nbsp;million shares of GFI held by BGC prior to the successful completion of the tender offer. Including
this gain, the calculation of purchase consideration and noncontrolling interest totaled $779.5 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a condition to closing,
Messrs. Gooch and Heffron resigned as directors of the board of directors of GFI. Mr.&nbsp;Gooch retains the titles of Vice Chairman of BGC Partners, L.P. and Chairman of the GFI Division, while Mr.&nbsp;Heffron continues to be the CEO of the GFI
Division. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Trayport Transaction </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On
December&nbsp;11, 2015, certain of our indirect subsidiaries (the &#147;Sellers&#148;) completed the sale (the &#147;Trayport Transaction&#148;) of all of the equity interests in the entities that made up the Trayport business (the &#147;Trayport
Business&#148;) to Intercontinental Stock Exchange, Inc. (&#147;ICE&#148;). The Trayport Business was GFI&#146;s European electronic energy software business. The Trayport Transaction occurred pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of
November&nbsp;15, 2015, by and among the Sellers, ICE, and for certain purposes, us and GFI (the &#147;Trayport Purchase Agreement&#148;). At the closing, the Sellers received 2,527,658 shares of ICE common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrent with the closing, the parties executed certain ancillary agreements, including a transition services agreement, a registration
rights agreement with respect to the ICE common stock issued to the Sellers, and an amendment and restatement of the existing Framework Agreement dated September&nbsp;10, 2015 by and among us, Trayport Limited, and certain affiliates. The amended
Framework Agreement has a 10 year term, provides us and our affiliates with a license to use Trayport&#146;s patents, the right to receive contractual terms that are no less favorable than the ones provided by the Trayport Business to another party,
provides a framework for the commercial arrangements between us and the Trayport Business and contains certain restrictions on the assignment of such agreement by GFI, us and each of our affiliates to certain enumerated exchanges and competitors of
ICE. The Sellers further agreed in the Trayport Purchase Agreement that they will not, subject to certain exceptions, compete with the Trayport Business for two years after closing. </P>

2013, we completed the sale (the &#147;NASDAQ Transaction&#148;) of certain assets to NASDAQ. At the closing, NASDAQ purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our affiliates, including the eSpeed brand name and various
assets comprising the fully electronic portion of our benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasury brokerage, market data and co-location service businesses (the &#147;Purchased Assets&#148;), for cash consideration of $750 million paid at closing, plus an
earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of NASDAQ common stock to be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing. The $750 million in cash paid at closing was subject to adjustment for certain pre-paid amounts and accrued costs and
expenses, and the 14,883,705 shares of NASDAQ common stock will be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing in which the consolidated gross revenue of NASDAQ, as a whole, is equal to or greater than $25 million. On each of
November&nbsp;12, 2013, November&nbsp;10, 2014 and November&nbsp;9, 2015, we received 992,247 shares of NASDAQ common stock in accordance with the agreement. The contingent future issuances of NASDAQ common stock are also subject to acceleration
upon the occurrence of certain events, including the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of NASDAQ&#146;s stock (including by merger), NASDAQ ceasing to hold Purchased Assets representing 50% or more of the aggregate revenue attributable to the
Purchased Assets as of the closing, and the sale of all or substantially all of NASDAQ&#146;s assets, as well as to certain anti-dilution provisions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of the NASDAQ Transaction, we only sold our on-the-run, benchmark 2-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 30-year fully electronic trading

Newmark&#146;s branding in their names and marketing materials. These agreements are normally multi-year contracts, and generally provide for mutual referrals in their respective markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees. Through
these independently-owned offices, our clients have access to additional brokers with local market research capabilities as well as other commercial real estate services in locations where our Real Estate Services business does not have a physical

informing our customers about our product and service offerings. We also employ product teams and business development professionals. We leverage our customer relationships through a variety of direct marketing and sales initiatives and build and
enhance our brand image through marketing and communications campaigns targeted at a diverse audience, including traders, potential partners and the investor and media communities. We may also market to our existing and prospective customers through
a variety of co-marketing/co-branding initiatives with our partners. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our brokerage product team is composed of product managers who are

leading commercial real estate services firm in the U.S. This is accomplished through media relations, industry sponsorships, and sales collateral and targeted advertising in trade and business publications. We believe that an emphasis on our Real
Estate Services businesses&#146; unique capabilities and specialty groups, such as Capital Markets, Office, Retail, Industrial, Healthcare, Hospitality and Global Corporate Services, enables us to demonstrate our strengths and differentiate
ourselves from our competitors. These multi-market business groups provide customized collateral, website and technology solutions that address specific client needs. On a local level, NGKF offices (including those owned by us and
independently-owned offices) have access to tools and templates that arm NGKF sales professionals with the market knowledge we believe is necessary to educate and advise clients, and also to bring properties to market quickly and effectively. This
includes proprietary research and analyses, web-based marketing systems, and ongoing communications and training about the firm&#146;s depth and breadth of services. Our Real Estate Services business provides marketing services and materials to
certain independently owned offices as part of their overall agreement allowing them to use NGKF&#146;s branding. We also benefit from shared referrals and materials from local offices. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Pre-Trade Technology.</I></B> Our financial brokers use a suite of pricing and analytical tools that have been developed both in-house
and in cooperation with specialist software suppliers. The pre-trade software suite combines proprietary market data, pricing and calculation libraries, together with those outsourced from what we believe to be the best-of-breed providers in the
sector. The tools in turn publish to a normalized, global market data distribution platform, allowing prices and rates to be distributed to our proprietary network, data vendor pages, secure websites and trading applications as indicative pricing.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Inter-Dealer and Wholesale Trading Technology.</I></B> We utilize a sophisticated proprietary electronic trading platform to
provide execution and market data services to our customers. The services are available through our proprietary API, FIX and a multi-asset proprietary trading platform, operating under names including BGC Trader, CreditMatch and FENICS. This
platform presently supports a wide and constantly expanding range of products and services, which includes FX Options, European corporate bonds, European CDS, interest rate swaps in multiple currencies, US REPO, TIPS, MBS, and other products. Every
product on the platform is supported in either view-only, hybrid/managed or fully electronic mode, and can be transitioned from one mode to the next in response to market demands. The flexible BGC technology stack is designed to support feature-rich
workflows required by the hybrid mode as well as delivering high throughput and low transaction latency required by the fully-electronic mode. Trades executed by our customers in any mode are eligible for immediate electronic confirmation through
direct straight-through processing (&#147;STP&#148;) links as well as STP hubs. The BGC trading platform services are operated out of several globally distributed data centers and delivered to customers over BGC&#146;s global private network,
third-party connectivity providers as well as the Internet. BGC&#146;s proprietary graphical user interfaces and the API/FIX connectivity are deployed at hundreds of major banks and institutions and service thousands of users. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Post-Trade Technology.</I></B> Our platform automates previously paper and telephone-based transaction processing, confirmation and
other functions, substantially improving and reducing the cost of many of our customers&#146; back offices and enabling STP. In addition to our own system, confirmation and trade processing is also available through third-party hubs, including
Swapswire, T-Zero, Reuters RTNS, Logicscope and STP in FIX for various banks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have electronic connections to most mainstream clearinghouses, including
The Depository Trust&nbsp;&amp; Clearing Corporation (&#147;DTCC&#148;), CLS Group, Euroclear, Clearstream, Monte Titoli, LCH.Clearnet, Eurex Clearing, CME Clearing and the Options Clearing Corporation (&#147;OCC&#148;). As more products become
centrally cleared, and as our customers request that we use a particular venue, we expect to expand the number of clearinghouses to which we connect in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Systems Architecture.</I></B> Our systems consist of layered components, which provide matching, credit management, market data
distribution, position reporting, customer display and customer integration. The private network currently operates from three concurrent core data centers (two of which are in London and one of which is in Trumbull, Connecticut) and six hub cities
throughout the world acting as distribution points for all private network customers. After June 2015, we transferred the Rochelle Park data center to a co-location center in Weehawken, New Jersey. Our network hubs beyond the core data centers are
in Chicago, Hong Kong, S&#259;o Paolo, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto. The redundant structure of our system provides multiple backup paths and re-routing of data transmission in the event of failure. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to our own network system, we also receive and distribute secure trading information from customers using the services of multiple, major Internet
service providers throughout the world. These connections enable us to offer our products and services via the Internet to our global customers. </P>

substantial efforts to the development and improvement of our hybrid and electronic marketplaces and licensed software products and services. We work with our customers to identify their specific requirements and make modifications to our software,
network distribution systems and technologies that are responsive to those needs. Our efforts focus on internal development, strategic partnering, acquisitions and licensing. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we employed over 400 technology
professionals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Intellectual Property </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have adopted a comprehensive intellectual property program to protect our proprietary technology. We currently have licenses covering
various Cantor patents in the United States, including patents relating to (i)&nbsp;a system and method for auction-based trading of specialized items such as fixed income instruments and (ii)&nbsp;a fixed income portfolio index processor. Foreign
counterpart applications for some of these U.S. patents have been filed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;page-break-before:always"></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Credit Risk </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit risk arises from potential non-performance by counterparties and customers. We have established policies and procedures to manage our
exposure to credit risk. We maintain a thorough credit approval process to limit exposure to counterparty risk and employ stringent monitoring to control the counterparty risk from our matched principal and agency businesses. Our account opening and
counterparty approval process includes verification of key customer identification, anti-money laundering verification checks and a credit review of financial and operating data. The credit review process includes establishing an internal credit
rating and any other information deemed necessary to make an informed credit decision, which may include correspondence, due diligence calls and a visit to the entity&#146;s premises, as necessary. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit approval is granted subject to certain trading limits and may be subject to additional conditions, such as the receipt of collateral or
other credit support. Ongoing credit monitoring procedures include reviewing periodic financial statements and publicly available information on the client and collecting data from credit rating agencies, where available, to assess the ongoing
financial condition of the client. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Principal Transaction Risk </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through our subsidiaries, we execute matched principal transactions in which we act as a &#147;middleman&#148; by serving as counterparty to
both a buyer and a seller in matching back-to-back trades. These transactions are then settled through a recognized settlement system or third-party clearing organization. Settlement typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade
date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. We generally avoid settlement of principal transactions on a free-of-payment basis or by physical delivery of the underlying
instrument. However, free-of-payment transactions may occur on a very limited basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The number of matched principal trades we execute
has continued to grow as compared to prior years. Receivables from broker-dealers and clearing organizations and payables to broker-dealers and clearing organizations on our consolidated statements of financial condition primarily represent the
simultaneous purchase and sale of the securities associated with those matched principal transactions that have not settled as of their stated settlement dates. Our experience has been that substantially all of these transactions ultimately settle
at the contracted amounts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Market Risk </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses
for a specified position. In our Financial Services business, we may allow certain of our desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are
primarily for the purpose of managing proprietary positions, facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, we may have market risk exposure on these transactions. Our
exposure varies based on the size of our overall positions, the risk characteristics of the instruments held and the amount of time the positions are held before they are disposed of. We have limited ability to track our exposure to market risk and
unmatched positions on an intra-day basis; however, we attempt to mitigate market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging our exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to
facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, we may not be able to unwind the position and we may be forced to hold the position for a longer
period than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have investments in marketable equity
securities, which are publicly traded, and which had a fair value of $650.4 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. These include the shares of common stock of NASDAQ that we received in exchange for a portion of our electronic benchmark Treasury
platform and the shares of the common stock of ICE that we received in exchange for Trayport. Investments in marketable securities carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that the marketable securities will not lose value and, in
general, securities markets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of marketable securities could be materially and adversely affected. We seek to minimize the effect of price changes on a
portion of our investments in marketable securities through the use of derivative contracts. However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with our investments in
marketable securities. See Note 10&#151;&#147;Marketable Securities&#148; and Note 12&#151;&#147;Derivatives&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding
these investments and related hedging activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our risk management procedures and strict limits are designed to monitor and limit the
risk of unintended loss and have been effective in the past. However, there is no assurance that these procedures and limits will be effective at limiting unanticipated losses in the future. Adverse movements in the securities positions or a
downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our
consolidated financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Financial Services businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse
markets in many currencies on a daily basis. If any of our data processing systems does not operate properly or is disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer impairment to
our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially
beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our
ability to expand our businesses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, despite our contingency plans, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted
by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with
whom we conduct business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other
information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures such as software programs, firewalls and similar technology to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients&#146; information,
the nature of the threats continue to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers,
unavailability or disruption of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. There have also been an increasing number of malicious cyber incidents
in recent years in various industries, including ours. Any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties important to our businesses, could present risks to our operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Foreign Currency Risk </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are exposed to
risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency rates create volatility in the U.S. dollar equivalent of our revenues and expenses in particular with regard to British Pounds and Euros. In addition, changes in
the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated net assets are recorded as part of our results of operations and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. We monitor the net exposure in foreign currencies on a daily basis and may hedge
our exposure as deemed appropriate with highly rated major financial institutions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Interest Rate Risk </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We had $840.9&nbsp;million in fixed-rate debt outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. These debt obligations are not currently subject to
fluctuations in interest rates, although in the event of refinancing or issuance of new debt, such debt could be subject to changes in interest rates. </P>

disaster recovery concerns. We operate most of our technology from dual-primary data centers at our two different London locations. Either site alone is capable of running all of our essential systems. In addition, we maintain technology operations
from data centers in New Jersey and Connecticut. Replicated instances of this technology are maintained in our London data centers. All data centers are built and equipped to best-practice standards of physical security with appropriate
environmental monitoring and safeguards. Failover for the majority of our systems is automated. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Competition </B></P>

such competitors include a number of smaller, private firms that tend to specialize in specific product areas or geographies. In November 2015, ICAP and Tullett announced an agreement whereby Tullett will purchase ICAP&#146;s global hybrid voice
brokering and information business. On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring 100% of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares. See &#147;Item 1-Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148; On January&nbsp;15, 2015 we entered into a
settlement agreement with Tullett that resolved all 10 outstanding lawsuits between the two companies. In exchange for our settlement payment, we agreed with Tullett for a period of one year not to hire senior employees, including desk heads, of the
other party and its subsidiaries. This agreement expired in January 2016. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Demand for services of brokers is directly affected by national and international economic and
political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in and uncertainty regarding tax laws and substantial fluctuations in the volume and price levels of securities transactions. Other
significant factors affecting competition in the brokerage industry are the quality and ability of professional personnel, the depth and pricing efficiency of the markets in which the brokers transact, the strength of the technology used to service
and execute on those markets and the relative prices of products and services offered by the brokers and by competing markets and trading processes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Market Data and Financial Software Vendors </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The majority of our large inter-dealer and wholesale financial broker competitors also sell proprietary market data and information, which
competes with our market data offerings. In addition to direct sales, we resell market data through large market data and information providers. These companies have established significant presences on the vast majority of trading desks in our
industry. Some of these market data and information providers, such as Bloomberg L.P. and Thomson Reuters Corporation, include in their product mix electronic trading and execution of both OTC and listed products in addition to their traditional
market data offerings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Exchanges and Other Trading Platforms </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although our businesses will often use exchanges to execute transactions brokered in both listed and OTC markets, we believe that exchanges
have sought and will seek to migrate products traditionally traded in OTC markets by inter-dealer and/or wholesale financial brokers to exchanges. However, we believe that when a product goes from OTC to exchange-traded, the underlying or related
OTC market often continues to experience growth in line with the growth of the exchange-traded contract. In addition, ICE operates both regulated exchanges and OTC execution services, and in the latter it competes directly with inter-dealer and/or
wholesale financial brokers in energy, commodities, and credit products. ICE entered these OTC markets primarily by acquiring independent OTC brokers, and we believe that it is likely ICE or other exchange operators may seek to compete with us in
the future by acquiring other such brokers, by creating futures products designed to mimic OTC products, or through other means. Further, ICE also operates a swap execution facility (&#147;SEF&#148;), as does Tradeweb Markets LLC
(&#147;Tradeweb&#148;) and we expect that other exchanges may also seek to do so. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to exchanges, other electronic trading
platforms which currently operate in the dealer-to-client markets, including those run by MarketAxess Holdings Inc., have stated an intention to compete with us in the inter-dealer markets. At the same time, we have begun to offer an increasing
number of our services to the customers of firms like MarketAxess. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the NASDAQ Transaction, we agreed that, for three
years after the closing, we and Cantor will not engage in the business of fully electronic brokerage of benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasuries and certain transactions in first off-the-run U.S. Treasuries, subject to certain exceptions. See
&#147;NASDAQ Transaction.&#148; Certain subsidiaries of GFI agreed that, for two years after the closing of the Trayport Transaction, they will not provide software to operate a trading network for certain energy commodities in Europe, substantially
as conducted by the Trayport Business at closing, subject to certain exceptions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Banks and Broker-Dealers </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Banks and broker-dealers have in the past created and/or funded consortia to compete with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers.&nbsp;For example,
ICAP plc&#146;s inter-dealer businesses for fully electronic trading of U.S. Treasuries and spot foreign exchange both began as dealer-owned consortia before being acquired by ICAP plc.&nbsp;An example of a current and similar consortium is
Tradeweb.&nbsp;Currently, several large banks hold stakes in Tradeweb, an Internet-based market intermediary.&nbsp;Thomson Reuters Corporation is Tradeweb&#146;s single largest shareholder. Although Tradeweb operates primarily as a dealer to
customer platform, some of its offerings include a voice and electronic inter-dealer platform and a SEF. In addition, Tradeweb&#146;s management has said that it would like to expand into other inter-dealer markets, and as such may compete with us
in other areas over time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, certain investment management firms that traditionally deal with banks and broker-dealers have
expressed a desire to have direct access to certain parts of the wholesale financial markets via firms such as ours. We believe that over time, interdealer-brokers will therefore gain a small percentage of the sales and trading market currently
dominated by banks and broker-dealers. Since their collective revenues are many times those of the global inter-dealer market, we believe that our gaining a small share of banks and broker-dealers&#146; revenues would lead to a meaningful increase
in our Financial Services revenues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Overall, we believe that we may also face future competition from market data and technology
companies and some securities brokerage firms, some of which are currently our customers, as well as from any future strategic alliances, joint ventures or other partnerships created by one or more of our potential or existing competitors. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our Real Estate Services segment, we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including
commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, capital markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research. Each business discipline is highly
competitive on a national, regional and local level. Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in
limited portions of our real estate management services business and have recently expanded their offerings. These include companies such as Aramark, ISS A/S, and ABM Industries. We also compete with in-house corporate real estate departments;
developers; institutional lenders; insurance companies; investment banking firms; investment managers; and accounting and consulting firms in various parts of our business. Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry
remains highly fragmented and competitive. Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are smaller than us, some of these competitors are more entrenched on a local or regional basis. We are also subject to competition from
other large multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours, including CBRE Group, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., Cushman&nbsp;&amp; Wakefield (majority-owned by TPG Capital), and Colliers International. In addition, more
specialized firms like HFF, Inc. and Eastdil Secured LLC (part of Wells Fargo&nbsp;&amp; Company) compete with us in certain areas. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Partnership
Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our partnership structure is one of the unique strengths of our business. Many of our key brokers,
salespeople and other front office professionals have their own capital invested in our business, aligning their interests with our stockholders. Limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings consist of: (i)&nbsp;&#147;founding/working partner
units&#148; held by limited partners who are employees; (ii)&nbsp;&#147;limited partnership units,&#148; which consist of a variety of units that are generally held by employees such as REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs,
ARPUs and NPSUs; (iii)&nbsp;&#147;Cantor units&#148; which are the exchangeable limited partnership interests held by Cantor entities; and (iv)&nbsp;preferred partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;), which are working partner units that may
be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with, the grant of REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs. For further details, see &#147;Our Organizational Structure.&#148; We also have NPSUs, which are
partnership units that are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions, not allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be exchangeable into shares of our common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its
designee, NPSUs are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type and will then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, including
that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. In addition, we have NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs (collectively, the &#147;N Units&#148;) which are
non-distributing partnership units that may not be allocated any item of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, the N Units
are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e., an NREU will be converted into an REU) and then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its
sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to us and comply with his or her partnership obligations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our partnership structure is an effective tool in recruiting, motivating and retaining key employees. Many brokers are
attracted by the opportunity to become partners because the partnership agreement generally entitles partners to quarterly distributions of income from the partnership. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests generally entitle our partners
to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our business, upon leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests as described below), any such partners are only entitled to
receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such partner&#146;s capital account or compensatory grant awards, excluding any
goodwill or going concern value of our business unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and we, as the general partner of BGC Holdings, otherwise determine. Our partners can receive the right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited
partnership interests for shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock (if, in the case of founding partners, Cantor so determines and, in the case of working partners and limited partnership unit holders, the BGC Holdings general partner, with
Cantor&#146;s consent, determines otherwise) and thereby realize any higher value associated with our Class&nbsp;A common stock. We believe that, having invested in us, partners feel a sense of responsibility for the health and performance of our
business and have a strong incentive to maximize our revenues and profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Relationship Between BGC Partners and Cantor </B></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal securities
laws, including adopting rules and regulations applicable to broker-dealers (other than government securities broker-dealers) and enforcing both its rules regarding broker-dealers and the Treasury&#146;s rules regarding government securities
broker-dealers. In addition, we operate a number of platforms that are governed pursuant to SEC Regulation ATS. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have
registered to do business. In addition, Treasury rules relating to trading government securities apply to such activities when engaged in by broker-dealers. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) is the federal agency
primarily responsible for the administration of federal commodities future laws and other acts, including the adoption of rules applicable to Futures Commissions Merchants, Designated Contract Markets (&#147;DCM&#148;) such as ELX, and Swap
Execution Facilities (&#147;SEF&#148;) such as BGC Derivative Markets, L.P. and GFI Swaps Exchange LLC. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Much of the regulation of
broker-dealers&#146; operations in the United States has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) that govern the operations of broker-dealers and
government securities broker-dealers and conduct periodic inspections and examinations of their operations. In the case of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, the principal self-regulatory organization is FINRA. FINRA was formed from the
consolidation of the NASD&#146;s member regulation operations and the regulatory arm of the NYSE Group to act as the self-regulatory organization for all broker-dealers doing business within the United States. Accordingly, our U.S. subsidiaries are
subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the SEC and FINRA. In our futures-related activities, our subsidiaries are also subject to the rules of the CFTC, futures exchanges of which they are members and the National Futures
Association (&#147;NFA&#148;), a futures self-regulatory organization. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The changing regulatory environment, new laws that may be passed

rules, if adopted, may directly affect our operations and profitability and those of our competitors and customers and of the securities markets in which we participate in a way that could adversely affect our businesses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC, self-regulatory organizations and state securities administrators conduct informal and formal investigations of possible
improprieties or illegal action by broker-dealers and their &#147;associated persons,&#148; which could be followed by the institution of administrative, civil and/or criminal proceedings against broker-dealers and/or &#147;associated persons.&#148;
Among the sanctions that may result if administrative, civil or criminal proceedings&nbsp;were ever instituted against us or our &#147;associated persons&#148; are injunctions, censure, fines, penalties, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or
suspension or expulsion from the industry and, in rare instances, even imprisonment. The principal purpose of regulating and disciplining broker-dealers is to protect customers and the securities markets, rather than to protect broker-dealers or
their creditors or equity holders. From time to time, our &#147;associated persons&#148; have been and are subject to routine investigations, none of which to date have had a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of
operations or prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In light of recent events in the U.S. and global financial markets, regulators and legislators in the U.S. and
European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) continue to craft new laws and regulations for the global OTC derivatives markets, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), which became law in July
2010. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates or encourages several reforms regarding derivatives, including new regulations for swaps markets creating impartiality considerations, additional pre- and post-trade transparency requirements, and heightened
collateral or capital standards, as well as recommendations for the obligatory use of central clearing for most standardized derivatives. The law also requires that standardized OTC derivatives be traded in an open and non-exclusionary manner on a
DCM or a SEF. The SEC is still in the process of finalizing rules for the implementation of these requirements and it is anticipated that the SEC will release their rule set surrounding SEFs in the first half of 2016. The actual implementation of
such rules may be phased in over a longer period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, while the recently adopted Volcker Rule will not apply directly to us, the
Volcker Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be continued uncertainty regarding the Volcker Rule, its impact on various affected businesses, how those
businesses will respond to it, and the effect that it will have on the markets in which we do business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Derivative Markets, L.P.
(&#147;BGC Derivative Markets&#148;), and GFI Swaps Exchange LLC, our subsidiaries, began operating as SEFs on October&nbsp;2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on
January&nbsp;22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for &#147;made available to trade&#148; products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing
of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. BGC also maintains its ownership stake in ELX, a CFTC-approved DCM. We believe that our relative competitive position is strong in this new environment, and
that we will gain market share in the U.S. This is because the new rules not only require OTC market execution venues to maintain robust front-end and back-office IT capabilities and to make large and ongoing technology investments, but also because
recent revisions to the execution methodology rules will allow elements of voice brokerage to flourish. We are a leader in both the breadth and scale of our hybrid and fully electronic trading capability, and we expect to outperform our competitors
in such an environment. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Financial Conduct Authority (&#147;FCA&#148;) is the relevant statutory regulator for the United Kingdom financial services industry. The
FCA was established in 2013, and superseded the former regulatory agency, the Financial Services Authority (&#147;FSA&#148;). The FCA&#146;s objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote
competition between financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FCA has continued to implement the far-reaching reform rules initiated by the FSA, that are designed to enhance firms&#146; liquidity risk
management practices, based on the lessons learned since the start of the credit crisis in 2007, as well as a regulatory model with a clear internal separation of conduct of business and prudential regulation. Implications of these rules include
better liquidity risk management capability (including the use of stress testing and contingency funding plans (&#147;CFP&#148;), less reliance on short-term wholesale funding, and a heightened reliance on higher amounts and quality of liquid asset
securities (such as government securities), leading to an increased likelihood of surviving a severe liquidity stress event with the overarching principles being self-sufficiency and adequacy of liquid resources. Currently, we have subsidiaries and
branches regulated by the FCA (BGC Brokers L.P., the U.K. branch of Aurel BGC, GFI Securities Ltd. and GFI Brokers Limited). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From time to
time, we have been and are subject to periodic examinations, inspections and investigations, including periodic risk assessment and related reviews of our U.K. group. As a result of such reviews, we may be required to include or enhance certain
regulatory structures and frameworks in our operating procedures, systems and controls. We are also required to obtain approval from the FCA to acquire control of U.K. regulated firms. See &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;19, 2014, we announced that we had resolved matters with the FCA regarding our acquisition of a stake in GFI Group exceeding
10% without first informing and seeking the approval of the FCA in breach of certain U.K. controller requirements. This was a breach of U.K. regulatory law. The FCA had taken the view that it was not appropriate in this specific case for it to take
any formal action. On November&nbsp;19, 2014, we also announced that we had received approval from the FCA to acquire control of GFI and thereby take control of the U.K. regulated firms within GFI. We have also received similar approvals in Hong
Kong and Singapore. Additional approvals were granted in connection with the Back-End Mergers in December 2015. See &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Increasingly, the FCA has developed a practice of requiring senior officers of regulated firms to provide individual attestations or
undertakings as to the status of the firm&#146;s control environment, compliance with specific rules and regulations, or the completion of required tasks. Officers of BGC Brokers L.P. and GFI Brokers Limited have given such attestations or
undertakings in the past and may do so again in the future. Similarly, the FCA can seek a voluntary requirement notice (&#147;VREQ&#148;), which is a voluntary undertaking on behalf of a firm that is made publicly available on the FCA&#146;s
website. In 2014, the FCA issued industry-wide interpretive guidance on the management of potential conflicts pursuant to the VREQ process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Recent

trade repositories (&#147;EMIR&#148;) was adopted in July 2012. EMIR fulfills several of the EU&#146;s G20 commitments to reform OTC derivatives markets. The reforms are designed to reduce systemic risk and bring more transparency to both OTC and
listed derivatives markets. EMIR derivatives rules will apply initially to financial and non-financial firms that are counterparties to derivatives contracts in the EU and later to those trading outside the EU under certain circumstances. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first compliance obligations for EMIR came into force in mid-March 2013 with the adoption of certain regulatory technical standards and
implementing technical standards which included timely confirmations. Risk mitigation techniques for uncleared OTC derivatives became effective September&nbsp;15, 2013 and comprised ISDA portfolio reconciliation, dispute resolution and disclosure
protocol. The trade reporting for OTC derivative contracts to be reported to a Trade Repository (&#147;TR&#148;) came into effect in phases during February to August 2014. By February 2017, all OTC derivative contracts entered into before or after
August&nbsp;16, 2012 and no longer outstanding as of February&nbsp;12, 2014 are to be reported to a TR. In October 2014, the European Commission adopted its first &#147;equivalence&#148; decisions for the regulatory regimes of central counterparties
in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. The central counterparties in these third country jurisdictions will be able to obtain recognition in the EU and can therefore be used by market participants to clear standardized OTC derivatives as
required by EU legislation, while remaining subject solely to the regulation and supervision of their home jurisdiction. In July 2013, the European Commission and the CFTC announced the &#147;Path Forward&#148; on the alignment of OTC derivatives
regulations between the two jurisdictions. For the EU, this involves the implementation of EMIR and proposed amendments to the European Commission&#146;s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#147;MiFID&#148;). </P>

supervisory reporting requirements, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (&#147;CEBS&#148;) issued guidelines on prudential reporting with the aim of developing a supervisory reporting framework based on common formats, known as COREP.
COREP has become part of European Banking Authorities&#146; implementing technical standards on reporting. In addition, guidelines on Financial Reporting covering consolidated and sub-consolidated financial reporting for supervisory purposes based
on International Financial Reporting Standards are being developed, known as FINREP. These initiatives will impact the nature, timing and extent of regulatory reporting for our European regulated group. </P>

scheduled to be introduced by bank regulators in most, if not all, of the world&#146;s major economies by 2019. Basel III is designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank
leverage. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate proprietary trading businesses and to maintain current capital market exposures under the present structure of their
balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Much of
our global derivatives volumes continue to be executed by non-U.S.-based clients outside the U.S. and subject to local prudential regulations. As such, we also continue to operate our Multilateral Trading Facility (&#147;MTF&#148;) in accordance
with EU directives as licensed by the FCA. The final draft of the European Commission&#146;s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive Level 2 Regulatory Technical Standards (&#147;MiFID II&#148;) was published by the European Securities and
Markets Authority (&#147;ESMA&#148;) in September 2015 where implementation is now expected to commence in January 2018. MiFID II will have a particularly significant impact in a number of key areas, including corporate governance, transaction
reporting, pre- and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection. MiFID II will also introduce a new regulated execution venue category known as the Organized Trading Facility (&#147;OTF&#148;) and
there is currently expected to be a joint equivalence assessment by EU and non-EU jurisdictions for granting mutual access to their respective domestic marketplaces. </P>

additional or similar changes to statutes or rules and regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, subject us to the risk of
fines, sanctions, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements and additional restrictions or limitations on our ability to conduct or grow our businesses, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new rules and regulations might take may negatively impact our customers and trading volumes in certain markets in which
we transact. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. While the broad framework of proposed rules and regulations is known, we believe that it remains premature to know conclusively the specific aspects of the U.S. and
E.U. proposals that may directly affect our businesses, as some proposals have not yet been finalized and others which have been proposed remain subject to supervisory debate. While we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations
may be positive for our businesses, unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may materially adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. </P>

adjustments, commonly referred to as &#147;haircuts,&#148; to the market value of securities positions to reflect the market risk of such positions prior to their liquidation or disposition. The Uniform Net Capital Requirements also impose a minimum

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a holding company, and our business is operated through two operating partnerships, BGC U.S., which holds our U.S. businesses, and BGC
Global, which holds our non-U.S. businesses. The limited partnership interests of the two operating partnerships are held by us and BGC Holdings, and the limited partnership interests of BGC Holdings are currently held by limited partnership unit
holders, founding partners, and Cantor. We hold the BGC Holdings general partnership interest and the BGC Holdings special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle us to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Holdings, and serve as
the general partner of BGC Holdings, which entitles us to control BGC Holdings. BGC Holdings, in turn, holds the BGC U.S. general partnership interest and the BGC U.S. special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to
remove and appoint the general partner of BGC U.S., and the BGC Global general partnership interest and the BGC Global special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC
Global, and serves as the general partner of BGC U.S. and BGC Global, all of which entitle BGC Holdings (and thereby us) to control each of BGC U.S. and BGC Global. BGC Holdings holds its BGC Global general partnership interest through a company
incorporated in the Cayman Islands, BGC Global Holdings GP Limited. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of January&nbsp;31, 2016, we held directly and indirectly, through
wholly owned subsidiaries, BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests consisting of 277,220,732 units and 277,220,732 units, representing approximately 67.1% and 67.1% of the outstanding BGC U.S. limited
partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, respectively. As of that date, BGC Holdings held BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests consisting of 135,884,464 units and 135,884,464
units, representing approximately 32.9% and 32.9% of the outstanding BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor directly hold BGC Holdings limited partnership interests. Since BGC Holdings
in turn holds BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor indirectly have interests in BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global
limited partnership interests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of January 31, 2016, excluding Preferred Units and NPSUs described below, outstanding BGC Holdings
partnership interests included 70,413,386 limited partnership units, 14,912,664 founding partner units and 50,558,414 Cantor units. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
may in the future effect additional redemptions of BGC Holdings limited partnership units and founding partner units for shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. We may also continue our earlier partnership restructuring programs, whereby we
redeemed or repurchased certain limited partnership units and founding partner units in exchange for new units, grants of exchangeability for Class&nbsp;A common stock or cash and, in many cases, obtained modifications or extensions of
partners&#146; employment arrangements. We also generally expect to continue to grant exchange rights with respect to outstanding non-exchangeable limited partnership units and founding partner units, and to repurchase BGC Holdings partnership
interests from time to time, including from Cantor, our executive officers, and other employees and partners, unrelated to our partnership restructuring programs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cantor units are generally exchangeable with us for our Class B common stock (or, at Cantor&#146;s option or if there are no additional
authorized but unissued shares of our Class B common stock, our Class&nbsp;A common stock) on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). Upon certain circumstances, Cantor may have the right to acquire additional Cantor
units in connection with the redemption of or grant of exchangeability to certain non-exchangeable founding partner units owned by persons who were previously Cantor partners prior to the separation, none of which was redeemed/exchanged in the
Global Partnership Restructuring Program. On November&nbsp;4, 2015, the Company issued exchange rights with respect to, and Cantor purchased, in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, an
aggregate of 1,775,481 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, as follows: In connection with the redemption by BGC Holdings of an aggregate of 588,356 non-exchangeable founding partner units from founding partners of BGC Holdings
for an aggregate consideration of $2,114,885, Cantor purchased 554,196 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate of $1,933,390 (after offset of a founding partner&#146;s $46,289 debt due to Cantor). In addition,
pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement, on November&nbsp;4, 2015, Cantor purchased 1,221,285 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $4,639,352 in
connection with the grant of exchangeability and exchange of 1,221,285 founding partner units. Exchangeable limited partnership units held by Cantor are exchangeable by Cantor at any time on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment) for shares of
Class&nbsp;A common stock of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of January&nbsp;31, 2016, there were 219,270 non-exchangeable founding partner units with
respect to which Cantor had the right to acquire an equivalent number of Cantor units. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;6, 2013, BGC GP, LLC, a
subsidiary of the Company and the General Partner of the Company&#146;s majority-owned subsidiary, BGC Holdings, and Cantor, the Majority in Interest Exchangeable Limited Partner of the Partnership, entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Agreement
of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the &#147;Ninth Amendment&#148;) effective as of July&nbsp;1, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to facilitate
partner compensation and for other corporate purposes, the Ninth Amendment creates new preferred partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;), which are working partner units that may be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with the grant
of, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, REUs, RPUs, AREUs, and ARPUs. These new Preferred Units carry the same name as the underlying unit, with the insertion of an additional &#147;P&#148; to designate them as Preferred Units. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Such Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class&nbsp;A common stock and
accordingly will not be included in the fully diluted share count. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings will be allocated to such Units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) of the allocation amount assigned to
them based on their award price, or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the &#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;), before calculation and distribution of the quarterly Partnership distribution for the remaining Partnership
units. The Preferred Units will not be entitled to participate in Partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. As of January&nbsp;31, 2016, there were 14,980,662 such units granted and outstanding. The Ninth
Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and by the full Board. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;9, 2014, partners of BGC
Holdings approved the Tenth Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of BGC Holdings effective as of May&nbsp;9, 2014. In order to facilitate partner compensation and for other corporate purposes the Tenth Amendment created a new class of
partnership units (NPSUs), which are working partner units. For more information, see Note 14&#151;&#147;Related Party Transactions&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June 5, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Cantor providing Cantor, CFGM and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold Class B common
stock the right to exchange from time to time, on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustment, up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of Class A common stock now owned or subsequently acquired by such Cantor entities for up to an aggregate of
34,649,693 shares of Class B common stock. These shares of Class B common stock represent the remaining 34,649,693 authorized but unissued shares of Class B common stock available under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The
exchange agreement will enable the Cantor entities to acquire the same number of shares of Class B common stock that they are already entitled to acquire without having to exchange their exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. Our
Audit Committee and full Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of us and our stockholders to approve the exchange agreement because it will help ensure that Cantor retains its exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC
Holdings, which is the same partnership in which our partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner employees. We and Cantor have agreed that any shares of Class B common stock issued in
connection with the exchange agreement would be deducted from the aggregate number of shares of Class B common stock that may be issued to the Cantor entities upon exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. Accordingly, the
Cantor entities will not be entitled to receive any more shares of Class B common stock under this agreement than they were previously eligible to receive upon exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;4, 2015, partners of BGC Holdings approved the Eleventh Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of BGC Holdings
(the &#147;Eleventh Amendment&#148;) effective as of October&nbsp;1, 2015. In order to facilitate partner compensation and for other corporate purposes the Eleventh Amendment created five new classes of non-distributing partnership units (&#147;N
Units&#148;), which are Working Partner Units. These new N Units carry the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional &#147;N&#148; to designate them as the N Unit type and are designated as NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and
NPPSUs. The N Units are not entitled to participate in Partnership distributions, will not be allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Subject to the approval
of the Compensation Committee or its designee, the N Units are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e. an NREU will be converted into an REU) and will then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and
conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. The Eleventh Amendment
was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and by the full Board of Directors. </P>

conditions or customer requirements. In our Financial Services businesses, the development of proprietary electronic trading technology entails significant technical, financial and business risks. Further, the adoption of new Internet, networking or
telecommunications technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify, adapt and defend our technology. There can be no assurance that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and
transaction-processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards, or that we will be able to successfully defend any challenges to any technology we develop. Any failure on our part to anticipate or respond adequately to
technological advancements, customer requirements or changing industry standards, or any significant delays in the development, introduction or availability of new products, services or technologies, could have a material adverse effect on our

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, our business operations have been substantially located in the U.S. and the U.K. While we are expanding our businesses
to new geographic areas, we are still highly concentrated in these areas. Because we derived approximately 58.3% and approximately 24.6%, respectively, of our total revenues on a consolidated basis for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 from our
operations in the U.S. and the U.K., respectively, our businesses are exposed to adverse regulatory and competitive changes, economic downturns and changes in political conditions in these countries. If we are unable to identify and successfully
manage or mitigate these risks, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>New

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As more participants enter the markets in which we operate, the resulting competition often leads to lower commissions and fees. This may
result in a decrease in revenues in a particular market even if the volumes, prices, or spreads of transactions we handle in that market increases. As a result, our strategy is to broker more transactions, manage more properties and increase market
share in existing markets and to seek out new customers and markets. We may face enhanced risks as these efforts to expand our businesses result in our transacting with a broader array of customers and counterparties and expose us to new products
and services and markets. Pursuing this strategy may also require significant management attention and hiring expense and potential costs and liability in any litigation or arbitration that may result. We may not be able to attract new customers or
brokers, salespeople, managers, or other professionals or successfully enter new markets. In addition, we may be prevented or limited from hiring new brokers, salespeople, managers or other professionals for some period by contract, such as our
one-year agreement with Tullett not to hire each other&#146;s employees, including desk heads, which expired in January 2016, or by regulatory restrictions or limitations. If we are unable to identify and successfully exploit new products and
services and market opportunities, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>In addition to hiring brokers, salespeople, managers and other professionals, we may pursue strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint
ventures or other opportunities, which could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs and could dilute our stockholders. We may also face competition in our acquisition strategy, as well as potential regulatory restrictions or limitations,
which may limit our number of strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures and other growth opportunities. Such transactions may materially adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have explored a wide range of strategic alliances, acquisitions and joint ventures with other financial and real estate services firms,
including maintaining or developing relationships with independently owned offices in our Real Estate Services businesses, and with other companies that have interests in businesses in which there are brokerage, management, or other strategic
opportunities. We also may make acquisitions outside of our existing industries, such as we did when we first entered the commercial real estate business beginning in 2011 with our acquisitions of Newmark and Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis. </P>

successfully hire, train, supervise and manage additional employees, expand our operational, financial reporting, compliance and other control systems effectively, allocate our human resources optimally, maintain clear lines of communication between
our transactional and management functions and our finance and accounting functions, and manage the pressure on our management, administrative, operational, financial reporting, internal control and compliance infrastructure. Additionally, managing
future growth may be difficult due to our new geographic locations, markets and business lines. As a result of these risks and challenges, we may not realize the full benefits that we anticipate from strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures
or new hires. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the changing demands we will face as we integrate and continue to expand our operations, and we may not be able to manage growth effectively or to
achieve growth at all. Any failure to manage the integration of acquisitions and future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>

often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity. Liquidity is of particular importance to our trading businesses, and perceived liquidity issues may affect the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions
with us in both of our operating segments. Our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties,
other third parties or us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a parent holding company with no direct operations. We conduct substantially all of our operations
through our operating subsidiaries. We do not have any material assets other than our direct and indirect ownership in the equity of our subsidiaries, BGC U.S. and BGC Global, and their respective operating subsidiaries. As a result, our operating
cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries. In addition, we are dependent on the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or
similar proceeding with respect to any of our subsidiaries, we, as an equity owner of such subsidiary, and therefore holders of our securities, including our notes, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary&#146;s creditors, including
trade creditors, and any preferred equity holders. Any dividends declared by us, any payment by us of our indebtedness or other expenses, and all applicable taxes payable in respect of our net taxable income, if any, are paid from cash on hand and
funds received from distributions, loans or other payments from BGC U.S. and BGC Global. Regulatory, tax restrictions or elections, and other legal or contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely from our subsidiaries. In
particular, many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws, regulations, and self-regulatory organization rules that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to a parent holding
company, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to meet our obligations. Certain debt and security agreements entered into by our
subsidiaries contain various restrictions, including restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us and the transfer by our subsidiaries of assets pledged as collateral. To the extent that we need funds to pay dividends, repay indebtedness and
meet other expenses, or to pay taxes on our share of BGC U.S.&#146;s and BGC Global&#146;s net taxable income, and either BGC U.S. or BGC Global or their respective subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law,
regulations, or agreements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including our ability to raise additional funding, including
through access to the debt and equity capital markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to raise funding in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets

adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. To the extent we are not able to access the debt capital markets on acceptable terms in the future, we may seek to raise funding and capital through equity issuances or other
means. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Future turbulence in the U.S. and international economy and markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and

necessitate greater short-term borrowing in the interim, which in turn may adversely affect the interest rates on our debt and our credit ratings and associated outlooks. </P>

may, however, need to access short-term capital sources to meet business needs from time to time, including, but not limited to, financing acquisitions, conducting operations, hiring or retaining brokers, providing liquidity and funding fails,
including in situations where we may not be able to access the capital markets in a timely manner when desired by us. Contingent liquidity needs are largely limited to potential cash collateral that may be needed to meet clearing bank, clearinghouse

indebtedness. On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring 100 percent of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares. In December 2014, we issued our 5.375% Senior Notes in anticipation of the tender offer which initiated such
acquisition. As part of the GFI acquisition, we assumed $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of GFI 8.375% Senior Notes due July 2018, and $60.0 million in short-term borrowings related to a GFI credit facility, which has since been repaid.
In addition, on March&nbsp;13, 2015, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $28.2 million under which we pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.70% and matures on
April&nbsp;1, 2019. Partially offsetting these increases to our indebtedness, on April&nbsp;13, 2015, our $150.0 million of 8.75% Convertible Senior Notes, due April&nbsp;15, 2015, were fully converted into approximately 24.0&nbsp;million shares of
our Class&nbsp;A common stock, which were issued to Cantor. Further, in December 2015 we completed the sale of our Trayport business in exchange for 2,527,658 shares of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (&#147;ICE&#148;) common stock, of which
2,030,203 shares have been sold as of February&nbsp;22, 2016. We may also enter into other short- or long-term financing arrangements in connection with similar acquisitions which may occur from time to time. In addition, in connection with the GFI
acquisition, we incurred substantial non-recurring transaction costs, including break-up fees, assumption of liabilities and expenses, and compensation expenses and we would likely incur similar expenses in connection with other
acquisitions.&nbsp;The increased level of our consolidated indebtedness in connection with the GFI acquisition or other potential acquisitions may restrict our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms, and such leverage, and any

proliferation of patents applicable to these industries and a substantial increase in the number of such patent applications filed. Under current law, U.S. patent applications typically remain secret for 18 months or, in some cases, until a patent
is issued. Because of technological changes in these industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of our products and services may unknowingly infringe existing
patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Although we have taken steps to protect ourselves, there can be no assurance that we will be aware of all patents, copyrights or trademarks that may pose a risk of infringement by our products

of which could materially negatively affect our businesses. Responding to these claims could also require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement, stop selling or redesign affected products or

third parties with whom we conduct business, such as was the case with Hurricane Sandy in 2012. This could include disruptions as the result of natural disasters, pandemics, or weather-related or similar events, such as fires, hurricanes,
earthquakes and floods, political instability, labor strikes or turmoil or terrorist attacks. These disruptions may occur, for example, as a result of events affecting only the buildings in which we operate (such as fires), or as a result of events
with a broader impact on the communities where those buildings are located. If a disruption occurs in one location and persons in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to or work from other locations, our ability to service and
interact with our customers and others may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communications or travel. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Such events can result in significant injuries and loss of life, which could result in material financial liabilities, loss of business and
reputational harm. They can also impact the availability and/or loss of commercial insurance policies, both for our own businesses and for those customers whose properties we manage and who may purchase their insurance through the insurance buying
programs we make available to them. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There can be no assurance that the disaster recovery and crisis management procedures we employ will
suffice in any particular situation to avoid a significant loss. Given that our employees are increasingly mobile and less reliant on physical presence in our offices, our disaster recovery plans increasingly rely on the availability of the Internet
(including &#147;cloud&#148; technology) and mobile phone technology, so the disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation. Although we maintain insurance for liability, property damage and
business interruption, subject to deductibles and various exceptions, no assurance can be given that our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will not be materially negatively affected by such events in the future.

we do not currently anticipate that regulations restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases, or taxes that may be imposed on their release, would result in material costs or capital expenditures. However, we cannot be certain about the extent to
which such regulations will develop as there are higher levels of understanding and commitments by different governments around the world regarding risks related to the climate and how they should be mitigated. Regulations relating to climate change

make with respect to the properties they evaluate or manage on behalf of clients since climate change considerations may impact the relative desirability of locations and the cost of operating and insuring the properties. Future legislation that

on our matters, although these percentages may vary depending on business developments at us or Cantor or any of our or Cantor&#146;s affiliates. As a result, these key employees (and others in key executive or management roles whom we may hire from
time to time) dedicate only a portion of their professional efforts to our businesses and operations, and there is no contractual obligation for them to spend a specific amount of their time with us and/or Cantor. These two key employees may not be
able to dedicate adequate time to our businesses and operations, and we could experience an adverse effect on our operations due to the demands placed on our management team by their other professional obligations. In addition, these key
employees&#146; other responsibilities could cause conflicts of interest with us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement, which
includes non-competition and other arrangements applicable to our key employees who are limited partners of BGC Holdings, may not prevent our key employees, including Messrs. Lutnick and Merkel, whose employment by Cantor is not subject to these
provisions in the BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement, from resigning or competing against us. In addition, our success in the Financial Services segment has largely been dependent on the efforts of Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick and our President, Shaun
Lynn, and other executive officers. In the Real Estate Services segment, our success has similarly been dependent on efforts by Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick in connection with acquisitions and on an ongoing basis by officers such as Barry Gosin, Jimmy Kuhn and
other key employees, including some who have been hired in connection with these acquisitions. Should Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick leave or otherwise become unavailable to render services to us, control of us would likely pass to Cantor, and indirectly pass to
the then-controlling stockholder of CFGM (which is Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick), Cantor&#146;s managing general partner, or to such other managing general partner as CFGM would appoint, and as a result control could remain with Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick. If any of our
key employees in our Financial Services or Real Estate Services segments were to join an existing competitor, form a competing company, offer services to Cantor that compete with our services or otherwise leave us, some of our customers could choose
to use the services of that competitor or another competitor instead of our services, which could adversely affect our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and

Therefore, internal controls over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements<I>.</I> Due to the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the
internal controls. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. As such, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and stock price. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to identify and remediate any material weaknesses in our internal controls could affect our ability to prepare financial reports
in a timely manner, control our policies, procedures, operations, and assets, assess and manage our operational, regulatory, and financial risks, and integrate our acquired businesses. Similarly, we need to effectively manage any growth that we
achieve in such a way as to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable internal control, financial reporting, and legal and regulatory requirements. Any failures to ensure full compliance with internal control and financial reporting
requirements could result in restatement, delay or prevent us from accessing the capital markets, and harm our reputation and the market price for our Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P>

imposed or expected to be imposed by the FCA, may require significant expenses and divert management resources from our operations and could require a restructuring of our internal controls over financial reporting. Any such expenses, time

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to the commercial real estate industry, revenue and profits are generally higher in the fourth quarter of each year and lower in
the first quarter. This is a result of a general focus in the real estate industry on completing or documenting transactions by calendar year-end and because certain expenses are constant through the year. While the seasonality in our two segments
may be offsetting, these factors could have a material effect on our results of operations in any given period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The seasonality of our
businesses makes it difficult to determine during the course of the year whether planned results will be achieved, and thus to adjust to changes in expectations. To the extent that we are not able to identify and adjust for changes in expectations
or we are confronted with negative conditions that inordinately impact seasonal norms, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and concentration of market share among companies in the banking, brokerage,

top investment banks across equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities asset classes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also face existing and potential
competition from large exchanges, which seek or may seek to migrate trading from the inter-dealer market to their own. Consolidation and concentration of market share are occurring in this area as well. For example, in recent years, BATS Global
Markets acquired the foreign-exchange trading venue, Hotspot from KCG Holdings and the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited acquired the London Metal Exchange, while ICE completed the acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Consolidation among exchanges
may increase their financial resources and ability to compete with us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Continued consolidation and concentration of market share in the
financial services industry and especially among our customers could lead to the exertion of additional pricing pressure by our customers, impacting the commissions and spreads we generate from our brokerage services. Further, the consolidation and
concentration among exchanges, and expansion by these exchanges into derivative and other non-equity trading markets, will increase competition for customer trades and place additional pricing pressure on commissions and spreads. These developments
have increased competition from firms with potentially greater access to capital resources than we have. Finally, consolidation among our competitors other than exchange firms could result in increased resources and product or service offerings for
our competitors. If we are not able to compete successfully in the future, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Actions taken by central banks in major global economies may have a material negative impact on our businesses. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, policies undertaken by certain central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of
England, have involved quantitative easing or the buying and selling of currencies in the foreign exchange market. Quantitative easing involves open market transactions by monetary authorities to stimulate economic activity through the purchase of
assets of longer maturity and has the effect of lowering interest rates further out on the yield curve. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, as of
January&nbsp;1, 2016, the U.S. Federal Reserve held approximately $3.7 trillion worth of long-dated U.S. Treasury and Federal Agency securities which are not being traded or hedged. This compares to $1.7 trillion at the beginning of 2011 and zero
prior to September 2008. This has reduced volatility and volumes for listed and OTC interest rate products in the U.S. Although the Federal Reserve has ceased purchases, it continues to hold substantially all of the securities purchased. In
addition, despite the recent increase in interest rates, the Federal Reserve may continue to use traditional methods to keep short-term interest rates low by historical standards. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Recently, central banks in other jurisdictions, including the EU, Japan and China, have undertaken quantitative easing and other steps aimed
at reducing interest rates and stimulating their economies through monetary policy. In these jurisdictions also, interest rates are expected to remain low by historical standards for some time to come. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, global FX volumes were muted over various periods during the past several years, largely because certain major central banks, such
as those in Japan and China and, until recently, Switzerland, intervened to keep global currencies from appreciating, and because low interest rates (themselves partially a result of quantitative easing) in most major economies make carry-trade
strategies less appealing for FX market participants. In addition, increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions are likely to result in increased holdings of government securities, which holdings will be less likely to
be traded or hedged, thus reducing further transaction volumes in those securities. Since the new capital requirements make it more expensive for the banks and other financial institutions to hold assets other than government securities, the new
requirements may also reduce their trading and hedging activities in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. Moreover, many of our large bank customers have faced increasing
regulatory scrutiny of their rates and FX businesses, and this may negatively impact industry volumes. These central banking policies may materially adversely affect our businesses, particularly our rates and FX operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The migration of OTC swaps to SEF markets may adversely impact volumes, liquidity and demand for our services in certain markets. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, began operating as SEFs on October&nbsp;2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets
and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on January&nbsp;22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for &#147;made available to
trade&#148; products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. We also maintain our ownership stake in ELX, a CFTC-approved DCM.
Although we believe that BGC Derivative Markets, GFI Swaps Exchange and ELX are in compliance with applicable rules, no assurance can be given that this will always be the case, that the market for these products will not be less robust, that there
may accordingly be less volume and liquidity in these markets, that there may be less demand for our services or the market in general or that the industry will not experience disruptions as customers or market participants transition to the rules
associated with the Dodd-Frank Act. If such events were to occur, our businesses in these products could be significantly reduced and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

our revenues may be lower than in the past and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by future events. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Dodd-Frank Act mandated that certain cleared swaps (subject to an exemption from the clearing requirement) trade on either a DCM or SEF.
The list of swaps that will be required to be cleared and therefore executed through a SEF encompasses a vast number of swaps that have been traditionally executed OTC by wholesale brokers such as us. Certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were
effective immediately, while other portions will be effective only following rulemaking by the CFTC and SEC over an extended transition period. Additionally, the rules relating to SEFs require, among other things, that the SEF will have to comply
with certain core principles to maintain registration as a SEF. These principles relate to trading and product requirements, compliance and audit-trail obligations, governance and disciplinary requirements, operational capabilities, surveillance
obligations and financial information and resource requirements. In addition, SEFs will be required to maintain certain trading systems that meet the minimum functionality requirements set by the CFTC and SEC for trading in certain OTC derivatives
that are required to be cleared. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While there continues to be uncertainty about the exact impact of these changes, we do know that we will
be subject to a more complex regulatory framework going forward, and that there will be significant costs to prepare for and to comply with these ongoing regulatory requirements. We will incur increased legal fees, personnel expenses and other
costs, as we work to analyze and implement the necessary legal structure for full compliance with all applicable regulations. There will also be significant costs related to the development, operation and enhancement of our technology relating to
trade execution, trade reporting, surveillance, compliance and back-up and disaster recovery plans designed to meet the requirements of the regulators. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, it is not clear at this point what the impact of these rules and regulations will be on the markets in which we currently provide
our SEF services. During the continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules, the markets for cleared and non-cleared swaps may continue to be less robust, there may be less volume and liquidity in these markets and there may be
less demand for our services. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain banks and other institutions may be limited in their conduct of proprietary trading and may be
further limited from trading in certain derivatives. The new rules, including the proprietary trading restrictions for certain banks and other institutions, could materially impact transaction volumes and liquidity in these markets and our
businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely impacted as a result. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we fail to
continue to qualify as a SEF under any of these rules, we may be unable to maintain our position as a provider of execution and brokerage services in the markets for many of the OTC products for which we have traditionally acted as an intermediary.
This would have a broad impact on us and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results operations and prospects. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We engage in the brokerage of commodities derivatives, including those involving electric power and natural gas, and related products and

significant costs and liabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We or our clients may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations
relating to our commodities-related activities, including trading of electricity, natural gas, and environmental interests. New regulation of OTC derivatives markets in the U.S. and similar legislation proposed or adopted abroad will impose
significant new costs and new requirements on the commodities derivatives activities of us and our customers. Therefore, the overall reputation of us or our clients may be adversely affected by the current or future regulatory environment. Failure
to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and fines for market participants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
commodities-related activities of us and our clients are also subject to the risk of unforeseen catastrophic events, many of which are outside of our control, which could result in significant liabilities for us or our customers. We may not be able
to obtain insurance to cover these risks, and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. The occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with customers, may impair our operations,

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many aspects of our businesses, like those of other financial intermediary firms, are subject to
significant capital requirements. In the U.S., the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the NFA and various other regulatory bodies have stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the
nature and extent of these entities&#146; activities. Four of our subsidiaries, BGCF, GFI Securities LLC, Kyte Securities LLC and Mint are registered with the SEC and subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements. As Futures Commissions Merchants
(&#147;FCMs&#148;), BGCF and Mint are also subject to CFTC capital requirements. BGCF is also a member of the FICC, which imposes capital requirements on its members. We also hold a 49% limited partnership interest in Aqua, a U.S. registered
broker-dealer and ATS. These entities are subject to SEC, FINRA, CFTC and NFA net capital requirements. In addition, our SEFs, BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, are required to maintain financial resources to cover operating costs for
at least one year, keeping at least enough cash or highly liquid securities to cover six months&#146; operating costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our international
operations are also subject to capital requirements in their local jurisdictions. BGC Brokers L.P., BGC European Holdings, L.P., GFI Brokers Limited and GFI Securities Limited, which are based in the U.K., are currently subject to capital
requirements established by the FCA. The FCA applies stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of these brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of their activities. The provisions relating to
capital and liquidity requirements enforced by the FCA have undergone significant change in recent years, and our U.K. businesses are now required to maintain significantly higher regulatory levels of capital than they have in the past. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in
which they do business, such as Australia, France and Hong Kong. These regulations often include minimum capital requirements, which are subject to change. Further, we may become subject to capital requirements in other foreign jurisdictions in
which we currently operate or in which we may enter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to continue to maintain levels of capital in excess of regulatory
minimums. Should we fail to maintain the required capital, we may be required to reduce or suspend our broker-dealer operations during the period that we are not in compliance with capital requirements, and may be subject to suspension or revocation
of registration or withdrawal of authorization or other disciplinary action from domestic and international regulators, which would have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, should we fail to maintain the capital required by clearing
organizations of which we are a member, our ability to clear through those clearing organizations may be impaired, which may materially adversely affect our ability to process trades. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against capital, our operations that require the
intensive use of capital would be limited. Our ability to withdraw capital from our regulated subsidiaries is subject to restrictions, which, in turn, could limit our ability to pay our indebtedness and other expenses, dividends on our Class&nbsp;A
common stock, and distributions on our BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, and to repurchase shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock or purchase BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries,
including from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others, and pursue strategic acquisitions or other growth opportunities. We cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing. No
assurance can be given that required capital levels will remain stable or that we will not incur substantial expenses in connection with maintaining current or increased capital levels or engaging in business restructurings or other activities in
response to these requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, financial intermediary firms such as ours are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or
perceived conflicts, including for example principal trading and trading to make markets. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, and we will regularly seek to review and update
our policies, controls and procedures. However, these policies, controls and procedures may result in increased costs and additional operational personnel. Failure to adhere to these policies, controls and procedures may result in regulatory
sanctions or customer claims. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely

financial services industry, in general, is heavily regulated. Proposals for additional legislation further regulating the financial services industry are periodically introduced in the U.S., the EU and other geographic areas. Moreover, the agencies
regulating the financial services industry also periodically adopt changes to their rules and regulations, particularly as these agencies have increased the focus and intensity of their regulation of the financial services industry. </P>

Markets in Financial Instruments Directive Level 2 Regulatory Technical Standards (&#147;MiFID II&#148;) was published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (&#147;ESMA&#148;) in
September 2015 where implementation is now expected to commence in January 2018. MiFID II will have a particularly significant impact in a number of key areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, pre- and post-trade transparency,
technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection. MiFID II will also introduce a new regulated execution venue category known as the Organized Trading Facility, and there is currently expected to be a joint equivalence assessment
by EU and non-EU jurisdictions for granting mutual access to their respective domestic marketplaces. Therefore, uncertainties resulting from the possibility of additional legislation and/or regulation could materially adversely impact our
businesses. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions or limitations on business activity, suspension or expulsion from the industry, any of which could have a material adverse
effect upon us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, the European Commission and the CFTC announced the &#147;Path Forward&#148; on the potential alignment of
OTC derivatives regulations between the two jurisdictions. For the EU, this involves the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and MiFID II. The CFTC and the European Commission are still in the process of finalizing rules
for the implementation of these requirements and, as an additional factor, the SEC is anticipated to begin formalizing their own set of policies impacting security-based swap products in 2016. The actual implementation of any such collective rules
may be phased in over a longer period. There can be no guarantee that the final rules will not negatively impact our volumes or revenues or fundamentally alter the historical relationship between OTC wholesale brokers and our clients, which may have
a material adverse effect on us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, while the recently adopted Volcker Rule will not apply directly to us, once effective, the
Volcker Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be a continued uncertainty regarding the application of the Volcker Rule, its impact on various affected
businesses, how those businesses will respond to it, and the effect that it will have on the markets in which we do business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other
regulatory initiatives include Basel III (or the Third Basel Accord), a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk scheduled to be introduced by bank regulators in most, if not all, of the
world&#146;s major economies by 2019. Basel III is designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of
our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate proprietary trading businesses and to maintain current market exposures under the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in
order to stay active in our marketplaces. As a result, their businesses, results of operations, financial condition or prospects could be materially adversely affected, which might cause them to do less business. Such potential impact could
materially adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our Financial Services segment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the U.K., the FCA has continued to
implement far-reaching reform rules initiated by the FSA that are designed to enhance firms&#146; liquidity risk management practices, based on the lessons learned since the start of the recent credit crisis in 2007, as well as a regulatory model
with a clear internal separation of conduct of business and prudential regulation. Implications of these rules include better liquidity and risk management capability (including the use of stress testing and contingency funding plans), less reliance
on short-term wholesale funding, and a heightened reliance on higher amounts and quality of liquid asset securities (such as government securities), leading to an increased likelihood of surviving a severe liquidity stress event, the overarching
principles being self-sufficiency and adequacy of liquid resources. Currently, we have subsidiaries and branches regulated by the FCA (BGC Brokers L.P., the U.K. branch of Aurel BGC, GFI Securities Ltd. and GFI Brokers Limited). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, the authorities of certain EU countries may from time to time institute changes to tax law that, if applicable to us, could have a
material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similarly, the U.S. has proposed a series of changes to U.S. tax law, some of which could apply to us. It is not possible to predict if any of these
new provisions will be enacted or, if they are, what form they may take. It is possible that one or more of such provisions could negatively impact our costs and our effective tax rate, which would affect our after-tax earnings. If any of such
changes to tax law were implemented and/or deemed to apply to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including on our ability to attract, compensate and retain
executives and brokers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new laws and regulations might
take may negatively impact trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. While the broad framework of currently proposed laws and rules and regulations is known, we
believe that it remains premature to know conclusively the specific aspects of the U.S. and EU proposals which may directly impact our businesses as some proposals have not yet been finalized and others which have been proposed remain subject to
supervisory debate. Additionally, unintended consequences of the laws, rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be
implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws, rules or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and

which is very costly. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with us and are not designed to protect the holders of our stock,
notes or other securities. These regulations will often serve to restrict or limit our operations and activities, including through capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the
world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative
proceedings and examinations, inspections, and investigations, which may result in costs, penalties, fines, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements, restrictions or limitations, and censure, suspension, or expulsion.
Self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA and the NFA, along with statutory bodies such as the SEC, the CFTC, and the FCA, and other international regulators, require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Firms in the financial services industry, including us, have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years, and penalties, fines and other
sanctions sought by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the NFA, state securities commissions and state attorneys general in the U.S., and the FCA in the U.K. and other international regulators, have increased accordingly.
This trend toward a heightened regulatory and enforcement environment can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and this environment may create uncertainty. From time to time, we have been and are subject to periodic examinations,
inspections and investigations, including periodic risk assessment and related reviews of our U.K. group. As a result of such reviews, we may be required to include or enhance certain regulatory structures and frameworks in our operating procedures,
systems and controls. We are also required to obtain approval from the FCA to acquire control of U.K. regulated firms. Increasingly, the FCA has developed a practice of requiring senior officers of regulated firms to provide individual attestations
or undertakings as to the status of the firm&#146;s control environment, compliance with specific rules and regulations, or the completion of required tasks. Officers of BGC Brokers L.P. and GFI Brokers Limited have given such attestations or
undertakings in the past and may do so again in the future. Similarly, the FCA can seek a voluntary requirement notice, which is a voluntary undertaking on behalf of a firm that is made publicly available on the FCA&#146;s website. In 2014, the FCA
issued industry-wide interpretive guidance on the management of potential conflicts pursuant to the VREQ process. These activities have resulted, and may in the future result, in significant costs and remediation expenses, and possible disciplinary
actions by the SEC, the CFTC, the FCA, self-regulatory organizations and state securities administrators and have impacted, and may impact in the future, our acquisitions of regulated businesses or entry into new business lines. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The brokerage and financial services industries in general face substantial regulatory and litigation risks that may result in damages as
well as costs, and we may face damage to our professional reputation and legal liability if our products and services are not regarded as satisfactory or for other reasons, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.</B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many aspects of our current businesses involve substantial risks of
liability. The expansion of our businesses, including into new areas, imposes additional risks of liability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the normal course of
business, we have been a party to investigations, administrative proceedings, lawsuits, arbitrations and other actions involving primarily claims for damages. Examinations, inspections, regulatory inquiries and subpoenas or other requests for
information or testimony may cause us to incur significant expenses, including fees for legal representation and other professional advisors and costs associated with document production and remediation efforts. Such regulatory or other actions may
also be directed at certain executives or employees who may be critical to our businesses or to particular brokerage desks. The risks associated with such matters often may be difficult to assess or quantify, and their existence and magnitude often
remain unknown for substantial periods of time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A settlement of, or judgment related to, any such matters could result in civil or
criminal liability, penalties, fines, restrictions or limitations on our operations and activities and other sanctions and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
Any such action could also cause us significant reputational harm, which, in turn, could seriously harm us. In addition, regardless of the outcome of such matters, we may incur significant legal and other costs, including substantial management
time, dealing with such matters, even if we are not a party to the litigation or a target of the inquiry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our Financial Services
segment, we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain customers. As a result, if our customers are not satisfied with our products
or services, such dissatisfaction may be more damaging to our Financial Services businesses than to other types of businesses. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our
businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or cause significant reputational damage to us, which could seriously harm us. </P>

the services of brokers is intense, it could affect our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled brokers or other professional services personnel, in turn adversely impacting our revenues, resulting in a material adverse
effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.</B> </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to provide high-quality brokerage and other professional services and maintain
long-term relationships with our customers depends, in large part, upon our brokers and other professionals. As a result, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, we have significantly grown the number of brokers in our businesses through new hires and acquisitions of existing
businesses, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Competition for the services of brokers is intense, especially for brokers with experience in the specialized businesses in which we participate or we may seek to enter. If we are unable
to hire or retain highly qualified brokers, including retaining those employed by businesses we acquire in the future, we may not be able to enter new brokerage markets or develop new products or services. If we lose one or more of our brokers in a
particular market in which we participate, our revenues may decrease and we may lose market share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, recruitment and retention
of qualified brokers could result in substantial additional costs. We have been and are currently a party to, or otherwise involved in, several lawsuits and arbitrations involving competitor claims in connection with employee hires and/or
departures, including the litigations we settled with Tullett in January 2015. We may also pursue our rights through litigation when competitors hire our employees who are under contract with us. We believe such proceedings are common in the
financial services industry due to its highly competitive nature. An adverse settlement or judgment related to these or similar types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects. Regardless of the outcome of these claims, we generally incur significant costs and substantial management time in dealing with them. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we fail to attract new personnel, or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, or if we incur increased costs or restrictions
associated with attracting and retaining personnel (such as lawsuits, arbitrations, sign-on or guaranteed bonuses or forgivable loans), our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We face strong competition from brokerages, broker-dealers, financial services firms, and exchanges, many of which have greater market
presence, marketing capabilities and financial, technological and personnel resources than we have, which could lead to pricing pressures that could adversely impact our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses,
financial condition, results of operations or prospects.</B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial services industry is intensely competitive, and is expected to
remain so. In our Financial Services segment, we primarily compete with three major, diversified inter-dealer brokers and financial intermediaries. These inter-dealer brokers are ICAP, Tullett and Tradition, all of which are currently publicly
traded companies. In November 2015, ICAP and Tullett announced an agreement whereby Tullett will purchase ICAP&#146;s global hybrid voice brokering and information business. On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring
100% of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares (see Item&nbsp;1 &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148;). Other inter-dealer broker and financial intermediary competitors include a number of smaller, privately-held firms that tend to specialize in specific
products and services or geographic areas. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also compete with companies that provide alternative products and services, such as
contracts traded on futures exchanges, and trading processes, such as the direct dealer-to-dealer market for government securities and stock exchange markets for corporate equities, debt and other securities. We increasingly compete with exchanges
for the execution of trades in certain products, mainly in derivatives such as futures, swaps, options and options on futures. Certain exchanges have made and will likely continue to make attempts to move certain OTC-traded products to
exchange-based execution. We also compete with consortia, such as those operated by Tradeweb, which are created or funded from time to time by banks, broker-dealers and other companies involved in financial services, such as Thomson Reuters
Corporation, to compete in various markets with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers. In addition, financial data and information firms such as Thomson Reuters Corporation and Bloomberg L.P. operate trading platforms for both OTC and listed products,
and may attempt to compete with us for trade execution in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of our competitors have greater market presence, marketing

products. A default by one of our customers could lead to liquidity concerns in our business and, to the extent that Cantor or another entity that clears for us has difficulty meeting capital requirements or otherwise meeting its obligations, we may
need to provide our own liquidity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to
significant market-wide liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as &#147;systemic risk&#148; and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks,
securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. Similarly, our vendors, including insurance companies and other providers, are subject to normal business risks as well as risks
related to U.S. and international economic and market conditions. Failure of any of these vendor institutions could also materially adversely affect us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The credit ratings and associated outlooks of firms in our financial services industries, including us, may be critical to their reputation
and operational and financial success. A firm&#146;s credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and
liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels, the firm&#146;s competitive position
in the industry and its relationship with other firms. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances of that firm or related firms
warrant such a change. Any reduction in credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on acceptable terms, as well as the cost and other terms upon which any such financing can be obtained. In
addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties in certain markets and in certain transactions. Additional collateral may be required in the event of a credit ratings or outlook downgrade. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our financial services activities are subject to credit and performance risks, which could result in us incurring significant losses that
could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.</B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our activities are
subject to credit and performance risks. For example, our customers may not deliver securities to one of our operating subsidiaries which has sold those securities to another customer. If the securities due to be delivered have increased in value,
there is a risk that we may have to expend our own funds in connection with the purchase of other securities to consummate the transaction. While we will take steps to ensure that our customers and counterparties have high credit standings and that
financing transactions are adequately collateralized, the large dollar amounts that may be involved in our broker-dealer and financing transactions could subject us to significant losses if, as a result of customer or counterparty failures to meet
commitments, we were to incur significant costs in liquidating or covering our positions in the open market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have adopted policies and
procedures to identify, monitor and manage credit risk, in both agency and principal transactions, through reporting and control procedures and by monitoring credit standards applicable to our customers and counterparties. These policies and
procedures, however, may not be fully effective, particularly against fraud, unauthorized trading and similar incidents. Some of these risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, counterparties or
other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always
successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are, or may be, exposed, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our insurance policies do not provide
coverage for these risks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Transactions executed on a matched principal basis where the instrument has the same or similar characteristics
to the counterparty may expose us to correlation risk. In this case, the counterparty&#146;s inability to meet its obligations will also result in the value of the instrument declining. For example, if we were to enter into a transaction to sell to
a customer a bond or structured note where the issuer or credit support provider was such customer&#146;s affiliate, the value of the instrument would decline in value in tandem with the default. This correlation has the effect of magnifying the
credit loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are subject to financing risk because, if a transaction does not settle on a timely basis, the resulting unmatched
position may need to be financed, either directly by us or through one of the clearing organizations, at our expense. These charges may be recoverable from the failing counterparty, but sometimes they are not. In addition, in instances where the
unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged or widespread due to rapid or widespread declines in liquidity for an instrument, there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us, which, depending on their size and
duration, could limit our business flexibility or even force the curtailment of those portions of our businesses requiring higher levels of capital. Credit or settlement losses of this nature could materially adversely affect our businesses,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Declines in the financial markets have also led to the exposure of several cases of financial
fraud. If we were to have trading activity on an agency or principal basis with an entity engaged in defrauding investors or counterparties, we could bear the risk that the counterparty would not have the financial resources to meet their
obligations, resulting in a credit loss. Similarly, we may engage in financial transactions with third parties that have been victims of financial fraud and, therefore, may not have the financial resources to meet their obligations to us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In agency transactions, we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other
material terms of the transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and leave them to settle the trade directly. We are exposed to credit risk for commissions, as we bill
customers for our agency brokerage services. Our customers may default on their obligations to us due to disputes, bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Any losses arising from such defaults could materially adversely
affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In certain financial products, we act as a &#147;name
passing&#148; broker, where the parties to the trade will settle directly against each other when their names are given up. In these markets, we may from time to time provide quotes. These quotes are intended to provide market values where we
believe a customer can execute a transaction in a particular financial product. These quotes reflect our good faith view as to a reasonable bid/offer for that particular product. Prices may be received directly from a customer, or we may provide
prices where we are confident the customers will be able to execute a trade, but do not have a customer currently supporting the price. In these cases the price will be based on our professional judgment. We may post or provide bids and offers in an
effort (i)&nbsp;to present suitable markets where none would otherwise exist, or (ii)&nbsp;to exhibit spreads that are more reflective of contemporaneous market opinion or activity. In such cases, our efforts are intended to facilitate liquidity for
our customers and to draw market participants to participate in a transaction. Although we will exercise strenuous efforts to execute at any given price, we cannot guarantee an execution at a certain price level. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>In emerging market countries, we primarily conduct our financial services businesses on an agency and matched principal basis, where the
risk of counterparty default, inconvertibility events and sovereign default is greater than in more developed countries.</B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We enter
into transactions in cash and derivative instruments primarily on an agency and matched principal basis with counterparties domiciled in countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Transactions with these counterparties are generally in
instruments or contracts of sovereign or corporate issuers located in the same country as the counterparty. This exposes us to a higher degree of sovereign or convertibility risk than in more developed countries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, these risks may entail correlated risks. A correlated risk arises when the counterparty&#146;s inability to meet its obligations
also corresponds to a decline in the value of the instrument traded. In the case of a sovereign convertibility event or outright default, the counterparty to the trade may be unable to pay or transfer payment of an instrument purchased out of the
country when the value of the instrument has declined due to the default or convertibility event. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The global financial crisis of recent
years has heightened the risk of sovereign or convertibility events in emerging markets similar to the events that occurred in previous financial downturns. Our risk management function monitors the creditworthiness of emerging countries and
counterparties on an ongoing basis and, when the risk of inconvertibility or sovereign default is deemed to be too great, correlated transactions or all transactions may be restricted or suspended. However, there can be no assurance that these
procedures will be effective in controlling these risks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Concentration and Market Risk </B></P>

exchange, energy and commodities and equity and other asset classes. Our financial services brokerage revenues are strongest in our rates products, which accounted for approximately 32.6% of our total financial services brokerage revenues on a
consolidated basis for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. While we focus on expanding and have successfully diversified our product offerings, we may currently be exposed to any adverse change or condition affecting the rates product market.
Accordingly, the concentration of our businesses on rates products subjects our results to a greater market risk than if we had more diversified product offerings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Due to our current customer concentration, a loss of one or more of our significant customers could materially harm our businesses,

ten Financial Services customers collectively, accounted for approximately 16.4% of our total revenues. We have limited long-term contracts with certain of these customers. If we were to lose one or more of these significant customers for any
reason, including as a result of further consolidation and concentration in the financial services industry, and not be compensated for such loss by doing additional business with other customers or by adding new customers, our revenues would
decline significantly and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would materially suffer. </P>

certain customers (including many of our largest customers) to enter into customized volume discount pricing plans. While the pricing plans are designed to encourage customers to be more active on our electronic trading platform, they reduce the
amount of commissions and fees payable to us by certain of our most active customers for certain products, which could reduce our revenues and constrain our profitability. From time to time, these pricing plans come up for renewal. Failure of a
number of our larger customers to enter into renewed agreements, or agreements on terms as favorable as existing agreements, could have a material adverse effect on volumes on our electronic trading platform, the commissions payable to us, our
revenues and our profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Reduced spreads in securities pricing, levels of trading activity and trading through market makers

securities spreads. In addition, new and enhanced alternative trading systems, such as electronic communications networks, have emerged as alternatives for individual and institutional investors, as well as broker-dealers. As such systems do not
direct trades through market makers, their use could result in reduced revenues for us or for our customers. In addition, reduced trading levels could lead to lower revenues which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We have market risk exposure from unmatched principal transactions entered into by

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On a limited basis, our desks enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business to facilitate transactions, add
liquidity, improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue opportunities and attract additional order flow or in certain instances as the result of an error and, in a limited number of instances and subject to risk management limits, for the purpose
of proprietary trading. As a result, we have market risk exposure on these unmatched principal transactions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market risk refers to the
risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses for a specified position. In our Financial Services business, we may allow certain of our desks to enter into unmatched principal
transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are primarily for the purpose of managing proprietary positions, facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market
or attracting additional order flow<B>. </B>As a result, we may have market risk exposure on these transactions. Our exposure varies based on the size of the overall position, the terms and liquidity of the instruments brokered and the amount of
time the position is held before we dispose of the position. Although we have limited ability to track our exposure to market risk and unmatched positions on an intra-day basis, we attempt to mitigate market risk on these positions by strict risk
limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging our exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the
market on which it trades, we may not be able to unwind the position and we may be forced to hold the position for a longer period than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market. </P>

We, CF&amp;Co and other affiliates participate in off-the-run U.S. Treasuries as well as other markets by posting quotations for our respective accounts and by acting as principal. Such activity is intended, among other things, to assist us,
CF&amp;Co and our affiliates in managing proprietary positions (including, but not limited to, those established as a result of combination trades and errors), facilitating transactions, framing markets, adding liquidity, increasing commissions and
attracting order flow. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From a risk management perspective, we monitor risk on an end-of-day basis, and desk managers generally monitor
such exposure on a continuous basis. Any unmatched positions are intended to be disposed of in the short term. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the markets on which we trade, we may not be able
to match the position or effectively hedge its exposure and often may be forced to hold a position overnight that has not been hedged. To the extent these unmatched positions are not disposed of intra-day, we mark these positions to market. Adverse
movements in the securities underlying these positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a loss. </P>

current fair values. In addition, our estimates or determinations of the values of our various positions, assets or businesses are subject to the accuracy of our assumptions and the valuation models or multiples used. Any principal losses and gains

ICE that we received in exchange for Trayport. We may seek to manage the market risk exposure inherent in such holdings by minimizing the effect of price changes on a portion of such holdings through the use of derivative contracts. There can,
however, be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with these holdings, or that the costs of such hedging activities will not be significant. Further, any such hedging activities and
other risk management techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including unpredicted price movements, counterparty defaults or other risks that are unidentified or

Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. The impact of these fluctuations on our results could be magnified because generally non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in

expenditures, including with respect to their office space, permit more of their staff to work from home offices and/or seek corresponding reductions in office space and related management or other services. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a licensed real estate broker and provider of commercial real estate services, we and our licensed sales professionals and independent
contractors that work for us are subject to statutory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our sales professionals or independent contractors to litigation from parties
who purchased, sold or leased properties that we brokered or managed. We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales and leasing transactions, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services,
claiming that we did not fulfill our statutory obligations. We could also become subject to claims made by clients for whom we provided appraisal and valuation services and/or third parties who perceive themselves as having been negatively affected
by our appraisals and/or valuations. We also could be subject to audits and/or fines from various local real estate authorities if they determine that we are violating licensing laws by failing to follow certain laws, rules and regulations. </P>

hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role as property or facilities manager or project manager, even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a contractual matter, in which case we may be pressured to participate
in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the client relationship. Adverse outcomes of property and facilities management disputes or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our commercial real estate services business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to the extent we may be liable on our contracts, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance coverage procured and maintained by us. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by any commercial insurance we maintain in
amounts we believe are appropriate. However, in the event of a substantial loss or certain types of claims, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages. Additionally, in the event of
grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, insurance policies that we may have may not cover us at all. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering
insurance company&#146;s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly rated companies. In addition, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, we may not be covered by
insurance. Any of these events could materially negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>If we fail to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to commercial real estate brokerage, valuation and appraisal and mortgage
transactions and other real estate business lines, then we may incur significant financial penalties. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Due to the broad geographic
scope of our operations and the commercial real estate services we perform, we are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations specific to our services. For example, the brokerage of real estate sales and
leasing transactions and other related activities require us to maintain brokerage licenses in each state in which we conduct activities for which a real estate license is required. If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct brokerage activities
without a license or violate any of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our licenses, then we may be subject to audits, required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or be prevented from collecting commissions owed, be
compelled to return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, because the size and scope of commercial
real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous state licensing and regulatory regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have
increased. Furthermore, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business lines also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance. The failure to comply with both foreign and domestic laws, rules and regulations could result in
significant financial penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Environmental regulations may adversely impact our commercial real estate businesses and/or cause us to incur costs for cleanup of
hazardous substances or wastes or other environmental liabilities. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various
environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, and disclosure obligations which impact the management, development, use and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities, as well as mortgage
lending availability, with respect to some properties. A decrease or delay in such transactions may materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, a failure by us to disclose
environmental concerns in connection with a real estate transaction may subject us to liability to a buyer/seller or lessee/lessor of property. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in our role as property or facilities manager, we could incur liability under environmental laws for the investigation or
remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes at properties we currently or formerly managed, or at off-site locations where wastes from such properties were disposed. Such liability can be imposed without regard for the lawfulness of the
original disposal activity, or our knowledge of, or fault for, the release or contamination. Further, liability under some of these laws may be joint and several, meaning that one liable party could be held responsible for all costs related to a
contaminated site. We could also be subject to property damage or personal injury claims alleged to result from environmental contamination, or from asbestos-containing materials or lead-based paint present at the properties or facilities we manage.
Insurance for such matters may not be available or sufficient. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain requirements governing the removal or encapsulation of
asbestos-containing materials, as well as recently enacted local ordinances obligating property or facilities managers to inspect for and remove lead-based paint in certain buildings, could increase our costs of legal compliance and potentially
subject us to violations or claims. More stringent enforcement of existing regulations could cause us to incur significant costs in the future, and/or materially adversely impact our commercial real estate brokerage and management services
businesses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients
across our overall commercial real estate services businesses. As a result, allegations by private litigants or regulators of conflicts of interest or improper conduct by us, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as
negative publicity and press speculation about us or our activities, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects. In addition, if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal
liability, it could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results and operations or prospects, and cause significant reputational harm to us. </P>

materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We face challenges in our
ability to efficiently and/or effectively collect accounts receivable in certain geographic areas. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any of our clients or other parties
obligated to make payments to us may experience a downturn in their businesses that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition. As a result, a client or other party obligated to make payments to us may fail to make payments when
due, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any such failure to make payments when due or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any such party could result in material losses to us. A bankruptcy of a client or other party obligated to make payments to us
would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us. In addition, certain corporate services and property and facilities management agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients. If such a client or
other party obligated to make payments to us were to file for bankruptcy, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty (which
may include co-brokers, owners, landlords, lenders, insurance companies, hedging counterparties, service providers or other organizations with which we do business), or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual
commitments, may result in disruption to our businesses and material losses to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, any weakness in the global economy puts
additional financial stress on clients and landlords, which sometimes are the parties that pay our commissions and fees where we have placed a tenant client into their buildings. This in turn has negatively impacted our ability to collect our
receivables fully or in a timely manner. We cannot be sure that the procedures we use to identify and rectify slowly paid receivables, and to protect ourselves against the insolvencies or bankruptcies of clients, landlords and other third parties
with which we do business, which procedures may involve placing liens on properties or litigating, will be effective in all cases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of January&nbsp;31, 2016, we had agreements in place to operate on a collaborative and cross-referral basis with certain
independently-owned offices in the U.S. and elsewhere in the Americas in return for contractual and referral fees paid to us and/or certain mutually beneficial co-branding and other business arrangements. These independently owned offices generally
use some variation of Newmark in their names and marketing materials. These agreements are normally multi-year contracts, and generally provide for mutual referrals in their respective markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees.
Through these independently owned offices, our clients have access to additional brokers with local market research capabilities as well as other commercial real estate services in locations where we do not have a physical presence. From time to
time our arrangement with these independent firms may be terminated pursuant to the terms of the individual affiliation agreements. The opening of an owned office to replace an independently-owned office requires us to invest capital, which in some
cases could be material. In the event our affiliation arrangements are terminated, we may lose our market coverage in such market if we do not enter into a replacement affiliation arrangement or open or acquire an owned office. There can be no
assurance that, if we lose additional independently owned offices, we will be able to identify suitable replacement affiliates or fund the establishment or acquisition of an owned office. In addition, although we do not control the activities of
these independently owned offices, we may face reputational risk if any of these independently owned offices are involved in or accused of illegal, unethical or similar behavior. Failure to maintain coverage in important geographic markets may
negatively impact our operations, reputation, and ability to attract and retain key employees and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>

on hand and funds received from distributions or loans from BGC U.S. and BGC Global. As discussed above, regulatory, tax restrictions or elections, and other legal or contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely from our
subsidiaries. In addition, any unanticipated accounting, tax or other charges against net income could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and to make repurchases. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC U.S. and BGC Global intend to distribute to their limited partners, including us, on a pro rata and quarterly basis, cash that is not

profitability and strategic and operating needs of our businesses,&nbsp;including various capital adequacy and clearing capital requirements promulgated by federal, self-regulatory, and other authorities to which our subsidiaries are subject. We
expect to pay not less than 75% of our post-tax distributable earnings per fully diluted share as cash dividends to our common stockholders, with the balance of such distributable earnings to be available to repurchase shares of our Class&nbsp;A
common stock or purchase BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others. </P>

Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries as part of this policy, including those held by Cantor and/or its partners, our executive officers, other employees and partners. In October 2015, this
authorization was increased to $300 million. As of January&nbsp;31, 2016, we had approximately $291.6 million remaining under this authorization and may continue to actively make such repurchases or purchases, or cease to make such repurchases or
purchases, from time to time. In addition, from time to time, we may reinvest all or a portion of the distributions we receive in BGC U.S.&#146;s and BGC Global&#146;s respective businesses, although we neither have current plans to do so nor do we
expect to do so as long as we maintain our current dividend policy. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that future dividends will be paid or that dividend amounts will be maintained at current or future levels. </P>

distribute to our stockholders, then as founding/working partners, limited partnership unit holders and/or Cantor exercise any exchange right to acquire our Class&nbsp;A common stock or Class B common stock, as applicable, exchanging partners may
receive a disproportionate interest in the aggregate distributions by BGC U.S. and BGC Global that have not been distributed by us. The reason is that the exchanging partner could receive both (1)&nbsp;the benefit of the distribution that has not
been distributed by us from BGC U.S. and BGC Global to BGC Holdings (in the form of a distribution by BGC Holdings to its limited partners) and (2)&nbsp;the benefit of the distribution from BGC U.S. and BGC Global to us (in the form of a subsequent
cash dividend paid by us, a greater percentage indirect interest in BGC U.S. and BGC Global following a repurchase of Class&nbsp;A common stock by us or a greater value of assets following a purchase of assets by us with the cash that otherwise
would be distributed to our stockholders). Consequently, if our dividend policy does not match the distribution policy of BGC Holdings, other holders of Class&nbsp;A common stock and Class B common stock as of the date of an exchange could
experience a reduction in their interest in the profits previously distributed by BGC U.S. and BGC Global that have not been distributed by us. Our current dividend policy could result in distributions to our common stockholders that are different
from the distributions made by BGC Holdings to its unit holders. </P>

business with affiliates (including Cantor, BGC Holdings, or BGC U.S. and BGC Global, as the case may be) and ability to compensate key employees. Therefore, if Cantor, we, or BGC Holdings became subject to the Investment Company Act, it could make
it impractical to continue our businesses, impair agreements and arrangements, and impair the transactions contemplated by those agreements and arrangements, between and among Cantor, us, BGC Holdings, and BGC U.S., and BGC Global, or any

employee partners, some employee partners may be more attracted to the benefits of working at a privately controlled partnership, or at a public company with a different compensation structure than our own, which may adversely affect our ability to
recruit, retain, compensate and motivate these persons. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests entitle founding/working and other limited partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our businesses, upon
leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests, as described below), any such founding/working or other limited partners are, unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and us, as the
general partner of BGC Holdings, otherwise determine, only entitled to receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such
partner&#146;s capital account or post-termination amount, if any, and not any goodwill or going concern value of our businesses. Further, certain partner units have no right to a post-termination payment, receive a preferred but fixed distribution
amount, and/or cannot be made exchangeable into shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. Moreover, unless and until units are made exchangeable, limited partners have no unilateral right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests

founding/working and other limited partners to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, as well as other obligations. In addition, the exercise of Cantor&#146;s right to purchase from BGC Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests
generally when founding partner units are redeemed or granted exchangeability will result in the share of distributions of income from the operations of our businesses on other outstanding BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, including those
held by founding/working and other limited partners, to remain the same rather than increasing as would be the case if such interests were redeemed or granted exchangeability without such Cantor right to purchase. In addition, any purchase of
exchangeable limited partnership units by Cantor from BGC Holdings following Cantor&#146;s decision to grant exchangeability on founding partner units will result in additional dilution to the other partners of BGC Holdings. </P>

acquisitions or offerings by us involving issuances of shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock, that would dilute Cantor&#146;s voting power in us. </P>

Committee, but generally does not otherwise require the separate approval of our stockholders, and if such stockholder approval is required, Cantor may retain sufficient voting power to provide any such requisite approval without the affirmative

has authorized a dividend policy which provides that we expect to pay not less than 75% of our &#147;post-tax distributable earnings per fully diluted share&#148; as cash dividends to our common stockholders, with the balance of such distributable
earnings to be available to repurchase shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock or redeem or purchase BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries, including from Cantor, our executive officers, other

sole discretion of our board of directors. We are a holding company, with no direct operations, and therefore we are able to pay dividends only from our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions from BGC U.S. and BGC Global. Our
ability to pay dividends may also be limited by regulatory considerations as well as by covenants contained in financing or other agreements. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is our net assets
minus our capital (as defined under Delaware law), or, if we have no surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Accordingly, any unanticipated accounting, tax, regulatory
or other charges against net income may adversely affect our ability to declare dividends. While we intend to declare and pay dividends quarterly, there can be no assurance that our board of directors will declare dividends at all or on a regular
basis or that the amount of our dividends will not change. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Share Repurchases and Unit Purchases </B></P>

authorized such repurchases of stock or units from Cantor employees and partners. On October&nbsp;27, 2015, our Board of Directors and Audit Committee increased the share repurchase and unit redemption authorization to $300 million. As of
January&nbsp;31, 2016, we had approximately $291.6&nbsp;million remaining from its share repurchase and unit redemption authorization. From time to time, we may actively continue to repurchase shares and/or redeem units. </P>

residential property management and property services business into a separately traded public company. The stock performance of Colliers International Group Inc. before June&nbsp;2, 2015 reflects the performance of the combined FirstService
Corporation. The returns of the peer group companies have been weighted according to their stock market capitalization for purposes of arriving at a peer group average. Total returns are shown on a &#147;net dividend&#148; basis, which tax effects
dividend reinvestments from companies operating under certain U.K and European tax jurisdictions, according to local tax laws.</P>

Holdings founding/working partner and other limited partnership units, and to Cantor for its non-controlling interest. The amount of all of these payments is expected to be determined using the above definition of pre-tax distributable earnings per

stockholders. Under GAAP, a portion of the dividend equivalents on RSUs is required to be taken as a compensation charge in the period paid. However, to the extent that they represent cash payments made from the prior period&#146;s distributable
earnings, they do not dilute existing stockholders and are therefore excluded from the calculation of distributable earnings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term
&#147;distributable earnings&#148; is not meant to be an exact measure of cash generated by operations and available for distribution, nor should it be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flow from operations or GAAP net income
(loss.) We view distributable earnings as a metric that is not necessarily indicative of liquidity or the cash available to fund its operations. </P>

of operations. Management believes that distributable earnings and the GAAP measures of financial performance should be considered together. </P>

taxes,&#148; &#147;net income (loss) for fully diluted shares,&#148; and &#147;fully diluted earnings (loss) per share,&#148; because the items previously identified as excluded from &#147;pre-tax distributable earnings&#148; and &#147;post-tax

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We entered into the commercial real estate business in October 2011 with the acquisition of Newmark&nbsp;&amp; Company Real Estate, Inc.
(&#147;Newmark&#148;), a leading U.S. commercial real estate brokerage and advisory firm primarily serving corporate and institutional clients. Newmark was founded in 1929 in New York City. In 2000, Newmark embarked upon a national expansion and in
2006 entered into an agreement with London-based Knight Frank to operate jointly in the Americas as &#147;Newmark Knight Frank.&#148; In the second quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Grubb&nbsp;&amp;
Ellis Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, which we refer to as &#147;Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis.&#148; Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis was formed in 1958 and built a full-service national commercial real estate platform of property management,
facilities management and brokerage services. Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis was integrated with Newmark Knight Frank to form the resulting brand, Newmark Grubb Knight Frank (&#147;NGKF&#148;). NGKF is a full-service commercial real estate platform that
comprises our Real Estate Services segment, offering commercial real estate tenants, owners, investors and developers a wide range of services, including leasing and corporate advisory, investment sales, and real estate finance, consulting, project
and development management, and property and facilities management. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our customers include many of the world&#146;s largest banks,
broker-dealers, investment banks, trading firms, hedge funds, governments, corporations, property owners, real estate developers and investment firms. We have offices in dozens of major markets, including New York and London, as well as in Atlanta,
Beijing, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Copenhagen, Dallas, Denver, Dubai, Hong Kong, Houston, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Miami, Moscow, Nyon, Paris, Philadelphia, Rio de Janeiro, San Francisco, Santa Clara, S&atilde;o Paulo,

our future growth prospects as we continue to increase the scale and depth of our Financial Services and Real Estate Services platforms and continue to seek market-driven opportunities to expand our business in numerous financial asset classes. This
was exemplified by the successful completion of our tender offer for the majority of GFI&#146;s outstanding common shares. Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, BGC began consolidating the results of GFI, which continues to operate as a separately

shares, together with the 17.1&nbsp;million shares already owned by us, represented approximately 56% of the then-outstanding shares of GFI. We issued payment for the tendered shares on
March&nbsp;4, 2015 in the aggregate amount of $331.1 million. On April&nbsp;28, 2015, we purchased from GFI approximately 43.0&nbsp;million new shares at that date&#146;s closing price of $5.81 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250
million. The purchase price was paid to GFI in the form of a note due on June&nbsp;19, 2018 that bore an interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The new shares and the note eliminate in consolidation. Following the issuance of the new shares,
we owned approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock, which gave us control over the timing and process for the completion of a back-end merger (the &#147;Back-End Mergers&#148;) pursuant to the tender offer agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed our acquisition (the &#147;JPI Merger&#148;) of Jersey Partners, Inc. (&#147;JPI&#148;). The JPI Merger
occurred pursuant to a merger agreement (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), dated as of December&nbsp;22, 2015. Shortly following the completion of the JPI Merger, a subsidiary of BGC merged with and into GFI pursuant to a short-form merger under
Delaware law, with GFI continuing as the surviving entity (the &#147;GFI Merger&#148;). The Back-End Mergers allowed BGC to acquire the remaining approximately 33 percent of the outstanding shares of GFI common stock that BGC did not already
own.&nbsp;Following the closing of the Back-End Mergers, BGC and its affiliates now own 100 percent of the outstanding shares of GFI&#146;s common stock. See Note 4&#151;&#147;Acquisitions&#148; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,
Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about the GFI transaction. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In total, approximately
23.5&nbsp;million shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and $111.3 million in cash were issued or paid with respect to the closing of the Back-End Mergers, inclusive of adjustments.&nbsp;The total purchase consideration for all shares of GFI
purchased by BGC was approximately $750 million, net of the $250.0 million note previously issued to GFI by BGC, which is eliminated in consolidation.&nbsp;This figure excludes the $29.0 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2015 with
respect to the appreciation of the 17.1&nbsp;million shares of GFI held by BGC prior to the successful completion of the tender offer. The excess of total consideration over the fair value of the total net assets acquired, of approximately $453.8
million, has been recorded to goodwill and was allocated to our Financial Services. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe the combination of BGC and GFI creates a
strong and diversified Financial Services business, well positioned to capture future growth opportunities. Through this combination, we expect to deliver substantial benefits to customers of the combined company, and we expect to become the largest
and most profitable wholesale brokerage company. We also believe this is a highly complementary combination, which will result in meaningful economies of scale. While the front office operations will remain separately branded divisions, the back
office, technology, and infrastructure of these two companies are integrating in a smart and deliberate way. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we met our target of reducing Financial Services annualized expenses by at least $50 million by the first
quarter of 2016. We had previously expected a minimum of $40 million in further annualized cost savings by the first quarter of 2017, for a total of at least $90 million in annual savings. We now anticipate achieving a minimum of $100 million in
annual savings by the end of 2016. The improvement to our pre-tax profitability we expect to achieve with the $100 million in annualized cost savings will be at least 25 percent higher than the full year revenues of Trayport, which we have sold to
ICE for $650 million on December&nbsp;11, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;10, 2015, the Company guaranteed the obligations of GFI under the 8.375%
Senior Notes; as a consequence of guaranteeing GFI&#146;s debt, we have substantially improved the credit rating of GFI&#146;s bonds and lowered future interest payments. We have also been able to free up capital set aside for regulatory and
clearing purposes, allowing us to use our balance sheet more efficiently. As the integration of BGC and GFI continues, we expect to generate increased productivity per broker and to continue converting voice and hybrid broking to more profitable
fully electronic trading, all of which should lead to increased revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, we expect our results to further improve as we invest the net proceeds from the $650 million Trayport sale.</P>

pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November&nbsp;15, 2015. At the closing, we received 2,527,658 shares of ICE common stock issued with respect to the $650 million purchase price, which was adjusted at closing.&nbsp;Trayport, prior
to its sale, had generated revenues of approximately $80 million over the twelve months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015.&nbsp;BGC expects to pay effective cash taxes of no more than $64 million related to the Trayport purchase price, or an expected

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial intermediary sector has been a competitive area that grew over the first half of the past decade due to several factors. One
factor was the increasing use of derivatives to manage risk or to take advantage of the anticipated direction of a market by allowing users to protect gains and/or guard against losses in the price of underlying assets without having to buy or sell
the underlying assets. Derivatives are often used to mitigate the risks associated with interest rates, equity ownership, changes in the value of foreign currency, credit defaults by corporate and sovereign debtors and changes in the prices of
commodity products. For the period from 1998 through 2007, demand from financial institutions, financial services intermediaries and large corporations has increased volumes in the wholesale derivatives market, thereby increasing the business
opportunity for financial intermediaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another key factor in the growth of the financial intermediary sector during the same timeframe
was the increase in the number of new financial products. As market participants and their customers strive to mitigate risk, new types of equity and fixed income securities, futures, options and other financial instruments have been developed. Most
of these new securities and derivatives are not immediately ready for more liquid and standardized electronic markets, and generally increase the need for trading and require broker-assisted execution. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, our Financial Services businesses have faced more challenging market conditions. While our foreign exchange (&#147;FX&#148;),
energy and commodities, and equities and other businesses operated in a generally improved macro environment in recent periods, our credit and rates businesses have continued to face a challenging macro environment that has been part of a greater
industry trend which has been attributed to a number of cyclical factors, including accommodative monetary policies by several major central banks including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank. These
accommodative monetary policies have resulted in historically low levels of volatility and interest rates across most financial markets. The global credit markets have also faced structural issues such as increased bank capital requirements under
Basel III. Consequently, these factors have contributed to lower trading volumes in our rates and credit asset classes across most geographies in which we operate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulators in the U.S. have finalized most of the new rules across a range of financial marketplaces, including OTC derivatives, as mandated
by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;). Many of these rules became effective in prior years, while ongoing phase-ins are anticipated over coming years. Legislators and regulators in Europe and
the Asia-Pacific region have crafted similar rules, some of which have already been implemented, specifically those falling under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (&#147;MiFID II&#148;), while others are expected to be implemented
in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These OTC-related regulations and proposed rules call for, among other actions, additional pre- and post-trade market
transparency, heightened collateral and capital standards, the transacting of certain derivatives using authorized venues, central clearing of most standardized derivatives, specific business conduct standards and the delivery of transaction data to
newly designated trade repositories for public dissemination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, began
operating as Swap Execution Facilities (&#147;SEFs&#148;) on October&nbsp;2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on January&nbsp;22, 2016.&nbsp;Mandatory Dodd-Frank
Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for &#147;made available to trade&#148; products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized
with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. We also maintain our ownership stake in ELX, a CFTC-approved designated contract market (&#147;DCM&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our relative competitive position is strong in this changing environment, and that we will gain market share. This is because
the new rules not only require OTC market execution venues to maintain robust front-end and back-office IT capabilities and to make large and ongoing technology investments, but also because recent revisions to the execution methodology rules will
allow elements of voice brokerage to flourish. We are a leader in both the breadth and scale of our hybrid and fully electronic trading capability, and we expect to outperform our competitors in such an environment. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Over the past few years there has been significant consolidation among the interdealer-brokers
and wholesale brokers with whom we compete. In addition to our 2015 acquisition of GFI, Tullett Prebon plc (&#147;Tullett&#148;) and ICAP plc (&#147;ICAP&#148;) recently announced an agreement whereby Tullett will purchase ICAP&#146;s global hybrid
voice broking and information business. We expect to continue to compete with ICAP&#146;s remaining electronic markets, post-trade and information businesses through the various offerings on our FENICS platform. We will also continue to compete with
Tullett across the voice/hybrid brokerage marketplace. However, we view the recent consolidation in the industry favorably, as we expect it to provide additional operating leverage to our Financial Services businesses in the future. </P>

a wholesale intermediary, our business is driven primarily by overall industry volumes in the markets in which we broker, the size and productivity of our front-office headcount (including brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office
personnel), regulatory issues and the percentage of our revenues we are able to execute by fully electronic means. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Below is a brief
analysis of the market and industry volumes for some of our financial services products including our overall hybrid and fully electronic trading activities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Overall Market Volumes and Volatility </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Volume is driven by a number of items, including the level of issuance for financial instruments, the price volatility of financial
instruments, macro-economic conditions, the creation and adoption of new products, the regulatory environment, and the introduction and adoption of new trading technologies. In general, increased price volatility increases the demand for hedging
instruments, including many of the cash and derivative products that we broker. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Rates volumes in particular are influenced by market
volatility, which has recently begun its rise as compared with recent averages. Central bank quantitative easing globally has reduced volumes because it entails the central banks buying government securities or other securities in the open
market&#151;particularly longer-dated instruments&#151;in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity and bring down long-term interest rates. When central banks hold these instruments, they tend not to trade or hedge&#151;thus lowering
rates volumes across cash and derivatives markets industry-wide. Despite the conclusion of its Quantitative Easing program in the fourth quarter of 2014, the U.S. Federal Reserve still had over $3.7 trillion worth of long-dated U.S. Treasury and
Federal Agency securities as of January&nbsp;1, 2016, compared with $1.7 trillion at the beginning of 2011 and zero prior to September 2008. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve has continued to roll over its existing positions and it is expected
to keep its balance sheet at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. Other major central banks have also greatly increased the amount of longer-dated debt on their balance sheets over the past few years and have indicated that they may continue
to do so. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the G-20 central banks have agreed to implement the Basel III accord. Basel III was drafted with the intention of
making banks more stable in the wake of the financial crisis. The accord, which will be phased in over the next few years, will force most large banks in G-20 nations to hold approximately three times as much Tier 1 capital as is required under the
previous set of rules. These capital rules make it more expensive for banks to hold non-sovereign debt assets on their balance sheets, and as a result, analysts say banks have reduced or will reduce their trading activity in corporate and
asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. We believe that this has further reduced overall industry volumes in many of the products we broker, particularly in credit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, industry volumes were generally mixed year-on-year for the OTC and listed products we broker in
rates, credit, FX, equities, energy and commodities. For example, volumes were generally up within equities, energy and commodities, FX futures, and European interest rate futures, while volumes were generally down within U.S. interest rate futures,
spot FX, and credit. Below is an expanded discussion of the volume and growth drivers of our various financial services brokerage product categories. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Rates Volumes and Volatility </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our rates business is influenced by a number of factors, including global sovereign issuances, secondary trading and the hedging of these
sovereign debt instruments. While the amount of global sovereign debt outstanding remains high by historical standards, the level of secondary trading and related hedging activity remains muted. For example, according to the Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association (&#147;SIFMA&#148;), the average daily volume of U.S. Treasuries among primary dealers was flat during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared with a year earlier. Additionally, interest rate volumes were down by
approximately 18% at CME, and up by 3% at Eurex. In comparison, our fully electronic rates revenues were up by approximately 37.3% from a year earlier, driven largely by the acquisition of GFI. Overall revenues from rates products were up by
approximately 16.7% during the period to $468.5 million, primarily driven by the addition of GFI and R.P. Martin. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;page-break-before:always"></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our rates revenues are not totally dependent on market volumes and therefore do not always fluctuate consistently with industry metrics. This
is largely because our voice, hybrid, and fully electronic desks in rates often have volume discounts built into their price structure, which results in our rates revenues being less volatile than the overall industry volumes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Overall, analysts and economists expect the absolute level of sovereign debt outstanding to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable
future as governments finance their future deficits and roll over their sizable existing debt. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (&#147;OECD&#148;)&#151;which includes almost all of the advanced and developed
economies of the world&#151;reported </P>

that general government debt as a percentage of GDP will be 71.8% for the entire OECD in 2017. This would represent a slight increase from 71.7% in 2015, but up considerably from the 39.2% figure
in 2007. Meanwhile, economists expect that the effects of various forms of quantitative easing will continue to negatively impact financial markets, as economic growth remains weak in most OECD countries. As a result, we expect long-term tailwinds
in our rates business from continuing high levels of government debt, but continued near-term headwinds due to the continued accommodative monetary policy of many major central banks. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Global FX volumes were generally mixed during 2015, as the fourth quarter reflected the anticipated and eventual rise of U.S. interest rates
for the first time since 2006. Additionally, FX volumes were impacted by the intervention and support of certain emerging market currencies by their respective central governments. Thus, spot FX at Thomson Reuters was down 6%, while FX futures at
CME were up 9%. Our fully electronic FX revenues increased approximately 56.3%, while our overall FX revenues increased by 44.4% to $310.6 million, primarily related to the acquisitions of GFI and R.P. Martin, as well as organic growth. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Credit Volumes </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The cash portion of our credit business is impacted by the level of global corporate bond issuance, while both the cash and credit derivatives
side of this business are impacted by sovereign and corporate issuance. Global credit derivative market turnover has declined over the last few years due to the introduction of rules and regulation for the clearing of credit derivatives in the U.S.
and elsewhere, along with non-uniform regulation across different geographies.&nbsp;In addition, many of our large bank customers continue to reduce their inventory of bonds and other credit products in order to comply with Basel III and other
international financial regulations. During the year, primary dealer average daily volume for corporate bonds was down by 7% according to Bloomberg. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, total dealer gross notional credit derivatives outstanding as reported
by SIFMA&#151;a reflection of the inter-dealer derivatives market&#151;was down by over 25% from a year earlier. In comparison, our fully electronic credit revenues were up 101.4%, driven largely by the addition of GFI, while overall credit revenues
increased by over 21.0% to $273.3 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Energy and Commodities </I></B></P>

Suisse Equity Research, the average daily volumes of U.S. shares were flat, while European shares traded were up 6%. Additionally, equity derivatives were down 11% as compared to a year ago. In contrast, our overall revenues from equities and other

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, technology-based product growth has led to higher margins and greater profits over time for exchanges and wholesale
financial intermediaries alike, even if overall company revenues remain consistent. This is largely because fewer employees are needed to process the same volume of trades as trading becomes more automated. Over time, electronification of
exchange-traded and OTC markets has also generally led to volumes increasing faster than commissions decline, and thus often to an overall increase in revenues. We have been a pioneer in creating and encouraging hybrid and fully electronic trading,
and we continually work with our customers to expand such trading across more asset classes and geographies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside of U.S. Treasuries
and spot FX, the banks and broker-dealers that dominate the OTC markets had generally been hesitant in adopting electronically traded products. However, in recent years, hybrid and fully electronic wholesale OTC markets for products, including CDS
indices, FX options, and most recently interest rate swaps, have been created as banks and dealers have become more open to electronically traded products and as firms like us have invested in the kinds of technology favored by our customers.
Recently enacted and pending regulation in Asia, Europe and the U.S. regarding banking, capital markets, and OTC derivatives has accelerated the adoption of fully electronic trading and we expect to benefit from the rules and regulation surrounding
OTC derivatives.&nbsp;Our understanding is that the rules that have been adopted or are being finalized will continue to allow for trading through a variety of means, including voice, and we believe the net impact of these rules and additional bank
capital requirements will encourage the growth of fully electronic trading for a number of products we broker. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The combination of more
market acceptance of hybrid and fully electronic trading and our competitive advantage in terms of technology and experience has contributed to our strong gains in electronically traded products. We continued to invest in hybrid and fully electronic
technology broadly across our financial services product categories. FENICS has exhibited significant growth that we believe has outpaced the financial technology and wholesale brokerage industry as a whole. We expect this trend to continue as we
convert more of our voice and hybrid brokerage into fully electronic brokerage across our FENICS platform. </P>

services, increased by over 126.6% to $224.3 million for the year, as compared with $99.0 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The increase in overall FENICS revenues for the year was primarily due to the acquisition of GFI along with
the strong organic growth generated by our market data and software solutions products. We offer electronically traded products on a significant portion of our Financial Services segment&#146;s hundreds of brokerage desks. The revenues, profits, and
growth of these products are more than double those of eSpeed, which we sold in the second quarter of 2013 for over $1.2 billion. The financial results and strong momentum of FENICS also compare favorably to other highly valuable electronic trading
platforms that are either publicly-traded or that have recently been sold by other companies. We expect the proportion of desks offering electronically traded products to continue to increase as we invest in technology to drive electronic trading
over our platform. Over time, we expect the growth of FENICS to further improve this segment&#146;s profitability and market share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Real Estate

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Real Estate Services segment continued to show strong growth and generated approximately 39% of our revenues for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2015. Real Estate brokerage revenues grew by 48.7% year-over-year, which included growth in real estate capital markets of 115.0% and in leasing and other services of 28.9%. This growth was primarily driven by the additions of ARA,
Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey, and Excess Space along with strong organic growth. While we benefited from positive industry trends, we believe that NGKF continued to gain market share. Our Real Estate management services and other revenues were up by
15.0%; and overall revenues improved by 40.9%. Our acquisitions of Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey and ARA are expected to continue to drive future growth of our Real Estate Services business, particularly in the higher margin capital markets brokerage
space. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect the overall profitability of our Real Estate Services business to increase as we increase its size and scale. However,
the pre-tax margins in the segment are also impacted by the mix of revenues generated by NGKF. For example, real estate capital markets, which includes sales, commercial mortgage broking, and other real estate-related financial services, generally
has larger transactions that occur with less frequency and more seasonality when compared with leasing advisory. However, real estate capital markets tend to have significantly higher pre-tax margins than NGKF as a whole. Leasing advisory revenues
are generally more predictable than revenues from real estate capital markets, while pre-tax earnings margins tend to be more similar to those of the segment as a whole. Property and facilities management, which together are called &#147;real estate
management services,&#148; generally have the most predictable and steady revenues, but with pre-tax earnings margins below those for NGKF as a whole. When management services clients agree to give us exclusive rights to provide real estate services
for their facilities or properties, it is for an extended period of time, which provides us with stable and foreseeable sources of brokerage revenues. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The key drivers of revenue growth for U.S. commercial real estate brokerage services companies include the overall health of the U.S. economy,
including gross domestic product and employment trends in the U.S., which drives demand for various types of commercial leases and purchases, the institutional ownership of commercial real estate as an investible asset class, and the ability to
attract and retain talent to our real estate services platform. In addition, in real estate sales, also known as real estate capital markets, growth is driven by the availability of credit to purchasers of and investors in commercial real estate.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Economic Growth in the U.S. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. economy is believed to have expanded by an annualized rate of 2.4% during 2015 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis&#146;s advance estimate, consistent with the average annual increase of 2.4% for the twelve months ended 2014. Many economists believe that U.S. economic growth faces near-term headwinds with a strong U.S. dollar and depressed energy prices
that adversely impact certain industries and geographies of the country. However, according to the most recent Bloomberg survey of economists, the consensus is for U.S. GDP to expand by 2.4% in 2016 and 2.3% in 2017. This moderate pace of growth
should keep interest rates and inflation low by historical standards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminarily reported that
employers added a monthly average of 279,000 net new payroll jobs during the fourth quarter, as compared to 274,000 in the prior year period. U.S. employers added 292,000 jobs in December of 2015, versus the trailing twelve month average of 226,000.
Despite the return to pre-recession unemployment rates (5.0% as of December 2015), the number of long-term unemployed and the labor force participation rate (the latter of which is near a 38-year low) remain disappointing for many economists, but
these indicators are less important to commercial real estate than job creation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;page-break-before:always"></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 10-year Treasury yield ended the fourth quarter at 2.27%, down from the prior quarter-end, but up from its recent low of 1.64% on
January&nbsp;30, 2015. 10-year Treasury yields have remained well below their 40-year average of approximately 6.6%, in large part due to market expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee (&#147;FOMC&#148;) will only moderately raise the
federal funds rate over the next few years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The combination of moderate economic growth and low interest rates that has been in place
since the recession ended has been a powerful stimulus for commercial real estate, delivering steady absorption of excess space and strong investor demand for the yields available through both direct ownership of assets and publicly traded funds.

property prices, as measured by the Commercial Property Price Index, reported by Moody&#146;s Real Capital Analytics (&#147;RCA&#148;). Additionally, U.S. commercial real estate sales volumes have increased year-on-year in twenty-four of the last
twenty-five quarters, as reported by RCA. If the U.S. economy continues to expand at the moderate pace envisioned by many economists, we would expect this to fuel the continued expansion of demand for commercial real estate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to CoStar&#146;s Value-Weighted U.S. Composite Index, average prices were up by over 12% year-over-year for the twelve-months ended
November 2015. During 2015, the dollar volume of significant property sales totaled $533 billion in the U.S., up by 23% from the year ago period according to RCA. In comparison, our real estate capital markets revenue increased approximately 115.0%

earlier, marking twenty-three consecutive quarters of improving average vacancy rates. Rents for all property types in the U.S. continued to improve modestly. According to NGKF Research, leasing activity during 2015 was roughly flat with the year

these developments will favor the larger inter-dealer brokers over smaller, non-public inter-dealer brokers, as the smaller ones generally do not have the financial resources to invest the necessary amounts in technology. We believe this will lead
to further consolidation across the wholesale financial brokerage industry, and thus further allow us to profitably grow our front-office headcount. </P>

revenues from our voice brokerage services on both an agency and matched principal basis. In agency transactions, we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other material terms of the
transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and leave them to settle the trade directly. Principal transaction revenues are primarily derived from matched principal
transactions, whereby revenues are earned on the spread between the buy and the sell price of the brokered security, commodity or derivative. Customers either see the buy or sell price on a screen or are given this information over the phone. The
brokerage fee is then added to the buy or sell price, which represents the spread we earn as principal transactions revenues. On a limited basis, we enter into unmatched principal transactions to facilitate a customer&#146;s execution needs for
transactions initiated by such customers. We also provide market data products for selected financial institutions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We offer our
brokerage services in seven broad product categories: rates, credit, FX, energy&nbsp;&amp; commodities, equities and other asset classes, leasing and other services, and real estate capital markets. The chart below details brokerage revenues by
product category and by voice/hybrid versus fully electronic (in thousands): </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As the above table indicates, our brokerage operations in the rates product category produce a
significant percentage of our total brokerage revenues. We expect that revenues from our rates product brokerage operations will increase in absolute terms, but decline as a percentage of revenues as we continue to invest in expanding in other asset
classes. These factors have enabled us to provide our client base with robust services across global markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our position as a leading
wholesale financial broker is enhanced by our hybrid brokerage platform. We believe that the more complex, less liquid markets on which we focus often require significant amounts of personal and attentive service from our brokers. In more mature
markets, we offer fully electronic trading capabilities to our customers through our platforms including FENICS and BGC Trader. Our hybrid platform allows our customers to trade on a voice, hybrid or, where available, fully electronic basis,
regardless of whether the trade is OTC or exchange-based, and to benefit from the experience and market intelligence of our worldwide brokerage network. Our electronic capabilities include clearing, settlement, post-trade, and other back-office
services as well as straight-through processing for our customers across several products. Furthermore, we benefit from the operational leverage in our fully electronic platform. We believe our hybrid brokerage approach provides a competitive
advantage over competitors who do not offer this full range of technology. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Rates </I></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The majority of our operating costs consist of cash and non-cash compensation expenses, which include base salaries, broker bonuses based on
broker production, guaranteed bonuses, other discretionary bonuses, and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of brokers, executives and other administrative support. The majority of our brokers receive a base salary and a
formula bonus based primarily on a pool of brokers&#146; production for a particular product or sales desk, as well as on the individual broker&#146;s performance. Members of our sales force receive either a base salary or a draw on commissions.
Less experienced salespeople typically receive base salaries and bonuses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of our compensation plans certain employees are granted
limited partnership units in BGC Holdings which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, that are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in FASB
guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocation of net income and grant of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in
our consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination
payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under FASB guidance, which requires that we record an
expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our consolidated statements of operations as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; The liability for limited partnership units
with a post-termination payout amount is included in &#147;Accrued compensation&#148; on our consolidated statements of financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into Class&nbsp;A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment).
At the time exchangeability is granted, the Company recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in &#147;Allocation of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and
FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have also awarded Preferred Units. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC
Holdings are allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the &#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;), which is deducted before the calculation
and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units

various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their limited partnership interests or
may be forgiven over a period of time. The forgivable portion of these loans is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the loan. From time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary
advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition, we also enter into deferred compensation agreements with employees providing services to us. The costs associated with such plans are generally amortized over the period in which they vest. See Note 19&#151;&#147;Compensation&#148; to our

selling and promotion expenses, which include entertainment, marketing and travel-related expenses. We incur communication expenses for voice and data connections with our clients, clearing agents and general usage; professional and consulting fees
for legal, audit and other special projects; and interest expense related to short-term operational funding needs, and notes payable and collateralized borrowings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Primarily in the U.S., we pay fees to Cantor for performing certain administrative and other support, including charges for occupancy of
office space, utilization of fixed assets and accounting, operations, human resources, legal services and technology infrastructure support. Management believes that these charges are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services rendered.
However, the expenses for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if we had not obtained these services from Cantor. In addition, these charges may not reflect the costs of services we may receive
from Cantor in the future. We incur commissions and floor brokerage fees for clearing, brokerage and other transactional expenses for clearing and settlement services. We also incur various other normal operating expenses. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had income from operations before income taxes of $388.8 million compared to a loss from operations
before income taxes of $3.2 million in the year earlier period. Our results include the results of GFI beginning in the first quarter of 2015. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased approximately $787.9 million to $2,575.4
million primarily due to a $685.4 million increase in brokerage revenues. This significant improvement was driven by the addition of GFI, the ongoing success of NGKF, our Real Estate Services segment and the continued strong double digit growth of
our high margin FENICS fully electronic businesses. Total expenses increased approximately $874.5 million to $2,706.0 million primarily due to a $696.9 million increase in total compensation and employee benefits. Also contributing to the increase
was a $177.6 million increase in total non-compensation </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
expenses. The absolute increase in expenses was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. While the front-office operations of GFI and BGC will remain separately branded, we have already begun
integrating the support functions, technology, and infrastructure of these two companies. We met our target of reducing Financial Services annualized expenses by at least $50 million by the first quarter of 2016. We had previously expected a minimum
of $40 million in further annualized cost savings by the first quarter of 2017, for a total of at least $90 million in annual savings. We now anticipate achieving a minimum of $100 million in annual savings by the end of 2016. The improvement to our
pre-tax profitability we expect to achieve with the $100 million in annualized cost savings will be at least 25 percent higher than the full year revenues of Trayport. This excludes the impact of any potential future acquisitions or net increase in
headcount due to hires made going forward. We also expect to increase productivity per broker and to continue converting voice and hybrid broking to higher margin fully electronic trading, all of which should lead to increased revenues and
profitability. By freeing up duplicative capital set aside for regulatory and clearing purposes in connection with the GFI integration, we will also be able to use our balance sheet more efficiently. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;11, 2015, we completed the sale of all of the equity interests in the entities that make up the Trayport business to
ICE.&nbsp;At the closing, we received 2,527,658 shares of ICE common stock issued with respect to the $650 million purchase price, which was adjusted at closing.&nbsp;Trayport, prior to its sale, had generated revenues of approximately $80 million
over the twelve months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015. During December 2015, we recorded an approximately $407 million gain, net of fees, related to the sale of Trayport and the net realized and unrealized gains on the ICE shares. Offsetting this
gain were approximately $187 million of expenses related to non-cash and/or non-dilutive charges, aside from those that might have been expected as part of the Company&#146;s ordinary operating business. Taking these items together resulted in an
approximately $220 million net gain. We expect our results to further improve as we invest the net proceeds from the $650 million Trayport sale. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Real Estate Services business (&#147;NGKF&#148;) once again had a very strong year, as the NGKF brokerage revenues increased by
approximately 48.7%. This significant improvement included an approximately 115.0% increase in revenues from our higher margin real estate capital markets business, 28.9% growth from leasing and other services and 14.6% growth from largely recurring
management services fees. This impressive outperformance was driven in part by the additions of Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey, ARA, Computerized Facility Integration, and Excess Space. In addition, our Real Estate Services business generated strong
organic growth as we continued to add dozens of high profile and talented brokers and other professionals, won new business, and were aided by solid commercial real estate market fundamentals. NGKF&#146;s revenues have grown at a compounded annual
rate of approximately 32% over the last two years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Given our strong momentum, we expect NGKF to generate top-line growth of approximately 20 percent for year 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that BGC&#146;s assets and businesses are independently worth significantly more than what is reflected in our current stock price.
Based on recent equity market and M&amp;A multiples, we think that the market is undervaluing both NGKF and FENICS. We also believe that the market has yet to properly value the more than $760 million in additional NASDAQ stock (based on the
February&nbsp;25, 2016 closing price) we anticipate receiving over time, which is not reflected on our balance sheet. Although no decisions have been made, we are considering a number of options designed to unlock substantial amounts of shareholder
value. We also expect our earnings to continue to grow as we increase the profitability of GFI, add revenues from our highly profitable fully electronic products, and benefit from the strength of our Real Estate Services business. We anticipate
having substantial resources with which to pay dividends, repurchase shares and/or units of BGC, profitably hire, and make accretive acquisitions, all while maintaining or improving our investment grade rating. </P>

income increased $10.0 million, or 25.2%, for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 as compared to the year earlier period. This increase was due to the $52.8 million recognized on the earn-out related to the NASDAQ Transaction and the associated
mark-to-market movements and/or hedging in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we recognized $39.5 million on the earn-out related to the NASDAQ Transaction. In both periods we received 992,247 shares

balance sheet and business model are not capital intensive. Our assets consist largely of cash, marketable securities, collateralized and uncollateralized short-dated receivables and less liquid assets needed to support our business. Longer-term
capital (equity and notes payable) is held to support the less liquid assets and potential capital intensive opportunities. Total assets at December&nbsp;31, 2015 were $4.0 billion, an increase of 45.1&nbsp;% as compared to December&nbsp;31, 2014.
The increase in total assets was driven primarily by increases in marketable securities, goodwill and other intangible assets. These increases were primarily related to the acquisitions of GFI, ARA, CFI and Excess Space. We maintain a significant
portion of our assets in cash and marketable securities, with our liquidity (which we define as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and securities owned) at December&nbsp;31, 2015 of $1,026.1 million. See &#147;Liquidity Analysis&#148;
below for a further discussion of our liquidity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;23, 2015, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized management to enter
into a revolving credit facility with Cantor of up to $150 million in aggregate principal amount pursuant to which Cantor or BGC would be entitled to borrow funds from each other from time to time. The outstanding balances would bear interest at the
higher of the borrower&#146;s or the lender&#146;s short term borrowing rate then in effect plus 1%. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. </P>

which certain Cantor entities serve as placement agent and referral agent. The program issues short-term notes to money market investors and is expected to be used from time to time as a liquidity management vehicle. The notes are backed by assets
of highly rated banks. We are entitled to invest in the program so long as the program meets investment policy guidelines, including relating to ratings. Cantor will earn a spread between the rate it receives from the short-term note issuer and the
rate it pays to us on any investments in this program. This spread will be no greater than the spread earned by Cantor for placement of any other commercial paper note in the program. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had no investments in the

of specific assets and/or our business model, such as matched fails and accrued compensation. We have limited need for short-term unsecured funding in our regulated entities for their brokerage business. Contingent liquidity needs are largely
limited to potential cash collateral that may be needed to meet clearing bank, clearinghouse, and exchange margins and/or to fund fails. Capital expenditures tend to be cash neutral and approximately in line with depreciation. Current cash balances
significantly exceed our unsecured letters of credit and our unsecured bank borrowings. We believe that cash in and available to our largest regulated entities, inclusive of financing provided by clearing banks, is adequate for potential cash
demands of normal operations such as margin or fail financing. We expect our operating activities going forward to generate adequate cash flows to fund normal operations, including any dividends issued pursuant to our dividend policy. However, we
believe that there are a significant number of capital intensive opportunities for us to maximize our growth and strategic position, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures potentially involving all types

note eliminate in consolidation. Following the issuance of the new shares, we owned approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock, which gave us control over the timing and process for the completion of a back-end merger (the

downgrades to the credit rating of GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes, the 8.375% Senior Notes were previously subjected to 200 basis points penalty interest. On April&nbsp;28, 2015, a subsidiary of the Company purchased from GFI approximately
43.0&nbsp;million newly issued shares of GFI&#146;s common stock. This increased BGC&#146;s ownership to approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock and gave us the ability to control the timing and process with respect to a full

the option to increase the aggregate loans to $200 million. The maturity date of the facility is February&nbsp;25, 2018. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at either LIBOR or a defined base rate plus an additional margin which ranges from
50 basis points to 250 basis points depending on our debt rating as determined by S&amp;P and Fitch and whether such loan is a LIBOR loan or a base rate loan. Contemporaneously with the closing of this credit agreement, the $25 million unsecured
credit agreement entered into on December&nbsp;24, 2015 with Bank of America, N.A. as lender was terminated. As of February&nbsp;29, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under either this $150 million facility or the terminated $25 million

leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm&#146;s competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be
revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt
financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in
certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain agreements, we may be required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit ratings downgrade. </P>

impact our cash flows in a given period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our investing and funding activities represent a combination of our capital raising activities,
including short-term borrowings and repayments, issuances of shares under our controlled equity offerings (net), Class&nbsp;A common stock repurchases and partnership unit redemptions, purchases and sales of securities, dispositions, and other
investments (e.g. acquisitions, forgivable loans to new brokers and capital expenditures-all net of depreciation and amortization). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our
securities settlement activities primarily represent deposits with clearing organizations. In addition, when advantageous, we may elect to facilitate the settlement of matched principal transactions by funding failed trades, which results in a
temporary secured use of cash and is economically beneficial to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other changes in working capital represent changes primarily in

result from additional cash investments or sales, which will be offset by a corresponding change in Cash and cash equivalents and accordingly will not result in a change in our liquidity. Conversely, changes in the market value of such securities

cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries.&nbsp;With the exception of the cash proceeds from the sale of Trayport, it is our intention to permanently reinvest undistributed foreign pre-tax earnings in the Company&#146;s foreign
operations.&nbsp;It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax that may be payable in the event these earnings are repatriated due to the fluctuation of the relative ownership percentages of the foreign subsidiaries between the
Company and BGC Holdings, L.P. With respect to the sale of Trayport, management concluded that the foreign proceeds attributable to the sale of Trayport in the amount of $603.9 million will ultimately be repatriated and will provide U.S. tax on
those amounts.&nbsp;For these proceeds which are not permanently reinvested, the deferred tax liability of $135.5 million is net of foreign tax credits, which will be generated at the time of repatriation.&nbsp;In addition, certain GFI Group net
operating loss carryforwards are expected to be utilized to reduce cash taxes.&nbsp;Taking these items together, we therefore expect to pay effective cash taxes of no more than $64 million related to the Trayport purchase price, or an expected rate
of less than 10 percent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Discussion of the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 </I></B></P>

and available cash resources are restricted by regulatory requirements of our operating subsidiaries. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities
commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer. In addition, self-regulatory organizations such
as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#147;FINRA&#148;) and the National Futures Association (&#147;NFA&#148;) along with statutory bodies such as the Financial Conduct Authority (&#147;FCA&#148;), the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;), and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the
financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with broker-dealers and are not designed to specifically protect stockholders. These regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer
protection and market conduct requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FCA is the relevant statutory regulator in the United Kingdom. The FCA was established in
2013, and superseded the former regulatory agency, the FSA. The FCA&#146;s objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote competition between financial services providers. It has broad
rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in
which they do business. Additionally, certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain non-U.S. net capital requirements. In Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC and GFI (HK) Securities LLC are regulated by the Securities and
Futures Commission. BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited and GFI (HK) Brokers Ltd, are regulated by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All are subject to Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC and BGC France Holdings; in
Australia, BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited, BGC (Securities) and GFI Australia Pty Ltd.; in Japan, BGC Shoken Kaisha Limited&#146;s Japanese branch; in Singapore, BGC Partners (Singapore) Limited, BGC Securities (Singapore) Ltd and GFI Group
PTE Ltd; in Korea, BGC Capital Markets&nbsp;&amp; Foreign Exchange Broker (Korea) Limited and GFI Korea Money Brokerage Limited; and in Turkey, BGC Partners Menkul Degerler AS, all have net capital requirements imposed upon them by local regulators.
In addition, the LCH (LIFFE/LME) clearing organization, of which BGC LP is a member, also imposes minimum capital requirements. In Latin America, BGC Liquidez Distribuidora De Titulos E Valores Mobiliarios Ltda. (Brazil) has net capital requirements
imposed upon it by local regulators. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, these subsidiaries may be prohibited from repaying the borrowings of their parents or
affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to their parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions, in each case, that result in a significant reduction in their regulatory capital position without prior notification or approval
from their principal regulator. See Note 22&#151;&#147;Regulatory Requirements,&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details on our regulatory requirements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, $510.1 million of net assets were held by regulated subsidiaries. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, these
subsidiaries had aggregate regulatory net capital, as defined, in excess of the aggregate regulatory requirements, as defined, of $245.1 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2013, our Board of Directors and Audit Committee authorized management to enter into indemnification agreements with Cantor and its
affiliates with respect to the provision of any guarantees provided by Cantor and its affiliates from time to time as required by regulators. These services may be provided from time to time at a reasonable and customary fee. </P>

the European Securities and Markets Authority (&#147;ESMA&#148;) in September 2015 where implementation is now expected to commence in January 2018. MiFID II will have a particularly significant impact in a number of key areas, including corporate
governance, transaction reporting, pre- and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection. MiFID II will also introduce a new regulated execution venue category known as the Organized Trading Facility,
and there is currently expected to be a joint equivalence assessment by EU and non-EU jurisdictions for granting mutual access to each&#146;s domestic marketplaces. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the end of the second quarter of 2013, we commenced a Global Partnership Restructuring Program, as a result of which we reduced our fully
diluted share count by approximately 32&nbsp;million shares. In November 2013, we entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (see &#147;Ninth Amendment to Partnership Agreement&#148; herein), which
created new preferred partnership units that may not be made exchangeable into our Class&nbsp;A common stock and are only entitled to a distribution each quarter at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other
amount as set forth in the award documentation, and accordingly they will not be included in the fully diluted share count. Going forward, we intend to continue to reduce our overall rate of share count growth by utilizing these new preferred
partnership units. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, in May 2014 we entered into the Tenth Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of BGC Holdings
(see &#147;Tenth Amendment to the Partnership Agreement&#148; herein). Pursuant to this amendment, NPSUs may not be made exchangeable into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and will not be allocated any items of profit or loss,
and accordingly they will not be included in the fully diluted share count. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;4, 2015, partners of BGC Holdings approved
the Eleventh Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of BGC Holdings (the &#147;Eleventh Amendment&#148;) effective as of October&nbsp;1, 2015. In order to facilitate partner compensation and for other corporate purposes the Eleventh
Amendment created five new classes of non-distributing partnership units (&#147;N Units&#148;), which are Working Partner Units. These new N Units carry the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional &#147;N&#148; to
designate them as the N Unit type and are designated as NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs. The N Units are not entitled to participate in Partnership distributions, will not be allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be made
exchangeable into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, N Units are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e. an NREU will be converted into
an REU) and will then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the
Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. The Eleventh Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and by the full Board of Directors. </P>

affiliates entitled to hold Class B common stock the right to exchange from time to time, on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustment, up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock now owned or subsequently acquired by such
Cantor entities for up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of Class B common stock. Such shares of Class B common stock, which currently can be acquired upon the exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units owned in BGC Holdings, are already
included in our fully diluted share count and will not increase Cantor&#146;s current maximum potential voting power in the common equity. These shares of Class B common stock represent the remaining 34,649,693 authorized but unissued shares of
Class B common stock available under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The exchange agreement will enable the Cantor entities to acquire the same number of shares of Class B common stock that they are already entitled to acquire
without having to exchange its exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. Our Audit Committee and full Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of us and our stockholders to approve the exchange agreement because
it will help ensure that Cantor retains its exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, which is the same partnership in which our partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner
employees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the exchange agreement, Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. (&#147;CFLP&#148;) and CFGM have the right to exchange the 22,996,166

April&nbsp;13, 2015) for the same number of shares of Class B common stock. Cantor would also have the right to exchange any shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock subsequently acquired by it for shares of Class B common stock, up to the limit of the
then-remaining authorized but unissued shares of Class B common stock (34,649,693 as of December&nbsp;31, 2015). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We and Cantor have
agreed that any shares of Class B common stock issued in connection with the exchange agreement would be deducted from the aggregate number of shares of Class B common stock that may be issued to the Cantor entities upon exchange of exchangeable
limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. Accordingly, the Cantor entities will not be entitled to receive any more shares of Class B Stock under this agreement than they were previously eligible to receive upon exchange of exchangeable limited
partnership units. </P>

reduced interest rate was the result of improved credit ratings following both the acquisition of GFI by the Company and the Guarantee. On January&nbsp;13, 2016, Moody&#146;s Investors Service further upgraded the credit rating on GFI&#146;s Notes,
eliminating the penalty interest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>COMMISSIONS PAID BY CANTOR ENTITIES </B></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The judgments involved in revenue recognition include determining the appropriate time to
recognize revenue. In particular within our Real Estate Services segment, we evaluate our transactions to determine whether contingencies exist that may impact the timing of revenue recognition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Equity-Based and Other Compensation </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Discretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense is comprised of discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in
cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary
bonuses, actual results may differ. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Restricted Stock Units: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition
provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) guidance. Restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and as per FASB guidance, we are required to record an
expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. FASB guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Because significant assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock.
Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected
dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards&#146; vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a
straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Restricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per FASB guidance, we are
required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance
with our and our affiliates&#146; customary noncompete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in five to ten years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the
grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Limited Partnership Units: Limited partnership units in BGC Holdings are generally held by employees. Generally such units receive quarterly
allocations of net income, which are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As discussed above, our new Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership
distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. As prescribed in FASB guidance, the quarterly allocations of
net income to such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocation of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of
operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional
amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under FASB guidance. Accordingly, we recognize a liability for these units on our
consolidated statements of financial condition as part of &#147;Accrued compensation&#148; for the amortized portion of the post-termination payment amount, based on the current fair value of the expected future cash payout. We amortize the
post-termination payment amount, less an expected forfeiture rate, over the vesting period, and record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period in our consolidated statements of operations as part of
&#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into Class&nbsp;A common
stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment). At the time exchangeability is granted, we recognize an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in &#147;Allocation of net income and grants of
exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred compensation expense, before associated income taxes of $231.4
million, $126.5 million and $57.0 million, respectively, related to the grant of exchangeability on partnership units. The 2015 amount includes a conversion of 90% of outstanding REUs and RPUs in December 2015 totaling $114.0&nbsp;million. </P>

of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period
of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these advances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and
future awards granted. The distributions are treated as compensation expense when made and the proceeds are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of
operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances.
Actual collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates. </P>

net of reserve, was $158.2 million and $130.8 million, respectively, and is included as &#147;Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net&#148; in our consolidated statements of financial condition. Compensation
expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $86.7 million (including a $47.2 million reserve), $25.7 million and $195.0 million (including a reserve of $160.5 million recognized in
connection with the Global Partnership Restructuring Program), respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Goodwill </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Goodwill
is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in FASB guidance, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically
tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using a two-step
process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first step involves comparing each reporting unit&#146;s estimated fair value with its carrying value, including goodwill.
To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These
assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because significant assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows, choosing peer companies and
selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the carrying
value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one
indicated a potential impairment may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual
assets, liabilities and identified intangibles. Events such as economic weakness, significant declines in operating results of reporting units, or significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g., estimates of cash flows
or cost of capital) could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Income Taxes </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
account for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in FASB guidance on Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between
the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of our entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (&#147;UBT&#148;) in
the City of New York. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners (see Note 2&#151;&#147;Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings&#148; for a discussion of partnership
interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners&#146; tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our consolidated
financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. Pursuant to FASB guidance on Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB
Statement on Accounting for Income Taxes, we provide for uncertain tax positions based upon management&#146;s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to
determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant
assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We recognize interest and
penalties related to income tax matters in &#147;Interest expense&#148; and &#147;Other expenses,&#148; respectively, in our consolidated statement of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax
planning strategies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws
and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because our interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law. </P>

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit risk arises from potential non-performance by counterparties and customers. BGC Partners has established policies and
procedures to manage its exposure to credit risk. BGC Partners maintains a thorough credit approval process to limit exposure to counterparty risk and employs stringent monitoring to control the counterparty risk from its matched principal and
agency businesses. BGC Partners&#146; account opening and counterparty approval process includes verification of key customer identification, anti-money laundering verification checks and a credit review of financial and operating data. The credit
review process includes establishing an internal credit rating and any other information deemed necessary to make an informed credit decision, which may include correspondence, due diligence calls and a visit to the entity&#146;s premises, as
necessary. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit approval is granted subject to certain trading limits and may be subject to additional conditions, such as the receipt
of collateral or other credit support. Ongoing credit monitoring procedures include reviewing periodic financial statements and publicly available information on the client and collecting data from credit rating agencies, where available, to assess
the ongoing financial condition of the client. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through its subsidiaries, BGC Partners executes matched principal transactions in which it
acts as a &#147;middleman&#148; by serving as counterparty to both a buyer and a seller in matching back-to-back trades. These transactions are then settled through a recognized settlement system or third-party clearing organization. Settlement
typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. BGC Partners generally avoids settlement of principal
transactions on a free-of-payment basis or by physical delivery of the underlying instrument. However, free-of-payment transactions may occur on a very limited basis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The number of matched principal trades BGC Partners executes has continued to grow as compared to prior years. Receivables from
broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers and Payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition primarily
represent the simultaneous purchase and sale of the securities associated with those matched principal transactions that have not settled as of their stated settlement dates. BGC Partners&#146; experience has been that substantially all of these
transactions ultimately settle at the contracted amounts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, BGC Partners incurs limited credit risk related to certain
brokerage activities. The counterparty risk relates to the collectability of the outstanding brokerage fee receivables. The review process includes monitoring both the clients and the related brokerage receivables. The review includes an evaluation
of the ongoing collection process and an aging analysis of the brokerage receivables. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Market Risk </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses
for a specified position. BGC Partners may allow certain of its desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are primarily for the purpose of
facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, BGC Partners may have market risk exposure on these transactions. BGC Partners&#146; exposure varies based on the size of its
overall positions, the risk characteristics of the instruments held and the amount of time the positions are held before they are disposed of. BGC Partners has limited ability to track its exposure to market risk and unmatched positions on an
intra-day basis; however, it attempts to mitigate its market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging its exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to facilitate customer
transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, BGC Partners may not be able to unwind the position and it may be forced to hold the position for a longer period
than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have investments in marketable equity
securities, which are publicly-traded, and which had a fair value of $650.4&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. These include the shares of common stock of NASDAQ that we received in exchange for a portion of our electronic benchmark Treasury
platform and the shares of the common stock of ICE that we received in exchange for Trayport. Investments in marketable securities carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that the marketable securities will not lose value and, in
general, securities markets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of marketable securities could be materially and adversely affected. We may seek to minimize the effect of price changes on a
portion of our investments in marketable securities through the use of derivative contracts. However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with our investments in

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our risk management procedures and strict limits are designed to monitor and limit the risk of
unintended loss and have been effective in the past. However, there is no assurance that these procedures and limits will be effective at limiting unanticipated losses in the future. Adverse movements in the securities positions or a downturn or
disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on BGC Partners&#146;
consolidated financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Operational Risk </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many
currencies on a daily basis. If any of our data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity,
financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our
control, including cybersecurity incidents, a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also
constrain our ability to expand our businesses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, despite our contingency plans, our ability to conduct business may be
adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or
third parties with whom we conduct business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Foreign Currency Risk </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Partners is exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates create volatility in the
U.S.&nbsp;Dollar equivalent of the Company&#146;s revenues and expenses. In addition, changes in the remeasurement of BGC Partners&#146; foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities are recorded as part of its results of operations
and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. BGC monitors the net exposure in foreign currencies on a daily basis and hedges its exposure as deemed appropriate with highly rated major financial institutions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The majority of the Company&#146;s foreign currency exposure is related to the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar versus the British Pound and the Euro. While
our international results of operations, as measured in U.S. Dollars, are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, we do not consider the related risk to be material to our results of operations. For the financial assets and liabilities denominated
in the British Pound and Euro, including foreign currency hedge positions related to these currencies, we evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar, holding all other assumptions
constant. The analysis identified the worst case scenario as both the Euro and British Pound strengthening against the U.S. Dollar. If as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Euro and British Pound had strengthened against the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar by 10%, the
currency movements would have had an aggregate negative impact on our net income of approximately $0.5 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Interest Rate Risk
</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Partners had $840.9 million in fixed-rate debt outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. These debt obligations are not
currently subject to fluctuations in interest rates, although in the event of refinancing or issuance of new debt, such debt could be subject to changes in interest rates. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have audited BGC Partners, Inc.&#146;s (the &#147;Company&#148;) internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria
established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). BGC Partners, Inc.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As indicated in the accompanying&nbsp;Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management&#146;s assessment of and conclusion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Computerized Facility Integration, LLC and Excess Space Retail Services, Inc., which are included in the&nbsp;2015 consolidated financial statements
of&nbsp;BGC Partners, Inc. and constituted&nbsp;$97.6 million or 2.5% of total assets as of&nbsp;December 31, 2015&nbsp;and&nbsp;$18.6&nbsp;million or 0.7%&nbsp;of revenues for the year then ended.&nbsp;Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting of&nbsp;BGC Partners, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Computerized Facility Integration, LLC and Excess Space Retail Services, Inc. In our opinion, BGC Partners Inc. maintained,

Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which amends the requirements for reporting discontinued operations in ASC 205-20. The ASU includes changes in the criteria and required disclosures for disposals
qualifying as discontinued operations, as well as additional required disclosures for disposals not considered discontinued operations. The amendments in this update were effective for the annual period beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2015 for the
Company. The adoption of this FASB guidance did not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which relates to how an entity recognizes the revenue it expects to be entitled to for the transfer of promised goods and services to customers. The ASU will
replace certain existing revenue recognition guidance. The guidance, as stated in ASU No.&nbsp;2014-09, was initially effective beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2018. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers&#151;Deferral of Effective Date, which defers the effective date by one year, with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
Management is currently evaluating the impact of the future adoption of the ASU on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements&#151;Going Concern, which relates to disclosure of
uncertainties about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern. The ASU provides additional guidance on management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate the condition of an entity and the required disclosures based on this assessment. The
amendments in this update are effective for the annual period ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and early application is permitted. The adoption of this FASB guidance would not impact the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. The amendment
eliminates the deferral of certain consolidation standards for entities considered to be investment companies and modifies the consolidation analysis performed on certain types of legal entities. The guidance is effective beginning January&nbsp;1,
2017 and early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-03, Interest&#151;Imputation of Interest, which relates to simplifying the presentation of
debt issuance costs. The ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendments
in this update are effective for the annual period beginning January&nbsp;1, 2016 for the Company, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this FASB guidance would not impact the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. </P>

Adjustments. This ASU requires adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period of a business combination to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Acquirers are no
longer required to revise comparative information for prior periods as if the accounting for the business combination had been completed as of the acquisition date. The guidance is effective beginning January&nbsp;1, 2016, with early adoption

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-01, Financial Instruments&#151;Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net
income unless the investments qualify for the new practicability exception. Entities will also have to record changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured under the fair value option in other comprehensive income. In
addition, entities will be required to present enhanced disclosures of financial assets and financial liabilities. The guidance is effective beginning January&nbsp;1, 2018, with early adoption of certain provisions of the ASU permitted. Management

classification as a finance or operating lease. The amendments also require certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures. Accounting guidance for lessors is largely unchanged. The guidance is effective beginning January&nbsp;1, 2019, with early
adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Founding/working partners have a limited partnership interest in BGC Holdings. The Company accounts for founding/working partner units
(&#147;FPUs&#148;) outside of permanent capital, as &#147;Redeemable partnership interest,&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. This classification is applicable to founding/working partner units because these
units are redeemable upon termination of a partner, including a termination of employment, which can be at the option of the partner and not within the control of the issuer. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Founding/working partner units are held by limited partners who are employees and generally receive quarterly allocations of net income. Upon
termination of employment or otherwise ceasing to provide substantive services, the founding/working partner units are generally redeemed, and the unit holders are no longer entitled to participate in the quarterly allocations of net income. Since
these allocations of net income are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and are contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder, they are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grant
of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Limited
Partnership Units </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain employees hold limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings (e.g., REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs and LPUs,
collectively the &#147;limited partnership units&#148;). Generally, such units receive quarterly allocations of net income, which are cash distributed and generally are contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in
FASB guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grant of exchangeability to limited partnership units and
FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. From time to time the Company issues limited partnership units as part of the consideration for acquisitions; these units are not entitled to a distribution of earnings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount of the units
in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards, and in accordance with FASB guidance, the Company records compensation expense for the
awards based on the change in value at each reporting date in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has also awarded certain preferred partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;). Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings
are allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the &#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;). These allocations are deducted before the
calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in
partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they
are not included in the Company&#146;s fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grant of exchangeability to limited
partnership units and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining partnership units generally receive quarterly allocations of net income based on their
weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cantor Units </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cantor units are reflected as a component of &#147;Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements
of financial condition. Cantor receives allocations of net income, which are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and are reflected as a component of &#147;Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries&#148; in the
Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>General </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of the limited partnership interests, described above, have been granted exchangeability into Class&nbsp;A common stock on a
one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment); additional limited partnership interests may become exchangeable for Class&nbsp;A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment). Because they are included in the Company&#146;s fully diluted
share count, if dilutive, any exchange of limited partnership interests into Class&nbsp;A common shares would not impact the fully diluted number of shares and units outstanding. Because these limited partnership interests generally receive
quarterly allocations of net income, such exchange would have no significant impact on the cash flows or equity of the Company. Each quarter, net income is allocated between the limited partnership interests and the common stockholders. In quarterly
periods in which the Company has a net loss, the loss allocation for FPUs, limited partnership units and Cantor units is allocated to Cantor and reflected as a component of &#147;Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in
subsidiaries&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. In subsequent quarters in which the Company has net income, the initial allocation of income to the limited partnership interests is to &#147;Net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries,&#148; to recover any losses taken in earlier quarters, with the remaining income allocated to the limited partnership interests. This income (loss) allocation process has no impact on the net income
allocated to common stockholders. </P>

over three to five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated economic useful lives or the remaining lease term. Routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When fixed assets are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the related gain or loss is included in operating income. The Company has asset retirement obligations related to certain of its leasehold improvements, which it accounts for using the FASB guidance, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement cost

assessing whether the unamortized carrying amount can be recovered over the remaining life through undiscounted future expected cash flows generated by the underlying assets. If the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying value of
the asset, an impairment charge would be recorded. The impairment charge would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the
risks involved. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net: </B></P>

in FASB guidance, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are periodically tested for impairment. The Company reviews goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. When reviewing goodwill for
impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company performed impairment evaluations for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 and concluded that there was no impairment of its goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. </P>

assets arising from business combinations include customer relationships, internally developed software, covenants not to compete and trademarks. Also included in the definite-lived intangible assets are purchased patents. The costs of acquired
patents are amortized over a period not to exceed the legal life or the remaining useful life of the patent, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method. </P>

income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in FASB guidance on Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of the Company&#146;s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (&#147;UBT&#148;) in New
York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners (see Note 2&#151; &#147;Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings&#148; for a discussion of partnership
interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners&#146; tax liability or benefit is not reflected in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in
the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. Pursuant to FASB guidance on Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement on Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management&#146;s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax
authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in &#147;Interest expense&#148; and &#147;Other expenses,&#148; respectively, in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P>

guidance, the Company is required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. The Company has granted restricted stock that is fully vested and not subject to continued employment or service with
the Company or any affiliate or subsidiary of the Company; however, transferability is subject to compliance with BGC Partners&#146; and its affiliates&#146; customary noncompete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by
partners in five to ten years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based
compensation expense in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Limited Partnership Units:</I></B> </P>

distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in FASB guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of
compensation expense under &#147;Allocation of net income and grant of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal
yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under FASB guidance, which requires that the Company record an expense for such awards based on the
change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; The liability for limited partnership units with a
post-termination payout amount is included in &#147;Accrued compensation&#148; on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into Class&nbsp;A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment).
At the time exchangeability is granted, the Company recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in &#147;Allocation of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and
FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has also awarded Preferred Units. Each quarter, the
net profits of BGC Holdings are allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the &#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;), which is deducted
before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred
Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not included in the Company&#146;s fully diluted share count.
The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under &#147;Allocation of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated

GFI for $6.10 per share in cash and accepted for purchase 54.3&nbsp;million shares tendered to the Company pursuant to the offer. The Tendered Shares, together with the 17.1&nbsp;million shares already owned by the Company, represented approximately
56% of the then- outstanding shares of GFI. The Company issued payment for the Tendered Shares on March&nbsp;4, 2015 in the aggregate amount of $331.1 million. On April&nbsp;28, 2015, a subsidiary of the Company purchased from GFI approximately
43.0&nbsp;million new shares at that date&#146;s closing price of $5.81 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. The purchase price was paid to GFI in the form of a note due on June&nbsp;19, 2018 that bears an interest rate of
LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The new shares and the note eliminate in consolidation. Following the issuance of the new shares, the Company owned approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock. This gave the Company control over the timing
of the Back-End Mergers pursuant to the tender offer agreement. The excess of total consideration over the fair value of the total net assets acquired, of approximately $453.8 million, has been recorded to goodwill and was allocated to the
Company&#146;s Financial Services segment. In addition, &#147;Total revenues&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 included $551.5 million related to GFI from the date of
acquisition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On August&nbsp;24, 2015, GFI, Messrs. Gooch and Heffron, directors and former executive officers of GFI; Jersey Partners
Inc. (&#147;JPI&#148;), a stockholder of GFI; CME Group, Inc. (&#147;CME&#148;); the former members of the GFI Special Committee; BGC; and certain other former officers and affiliates of GFI entered into a memorandum of understanding (the
&#147;MOU&#148;) with regard to a preliminary settlement (the &#147;Settlement&#148;) of the consolidated class action case pending against GFI in the State of Delaware (the &#147;Consolidated Delaware Action&#148;). Neither the Company nor GFI
contributed any funds to the Settlement, which was paid from a combination of insurance proceeds and payments by JPI and Messrs. Gooch and Heffron. The Settlement provides for a settlement fund of $10.75 million for the class of GFI stockholders in
the Consolidated Delaware Action and payment of attorneys&#146; fees and costs to plaintiffs&#146; counsel in an amount to be established by negotiation, mediation or a fee application to the Court. In connection with the Settlement, on
October&nbsp;6, 2015, the Company advanced $10.75 million to JPI (the &#147;JPI Note&#148;). The JPI Note bore interest at the rate of 5.375%&nbsp;per annum and was secured by 2&nbsp;million shares of GFI common stock then owned by JPI. In the MOU,
the CME agreed to terminate the restriction prohibiting former executive officers of GFI, JPI and certain other stockholders and affiliates of GFI from supporting the Back-End Mergers as defined in the February&nbsp;19, 2015 Tender Offer Agreement
by and among BGC, GFI and BGC Partners, L.P., or similar transactions until January&nbsp;30, 2016. Accordingly, BGC, GFI, JPI and certain affiliates entered into the Back-End Merger agreements on December&nbsp;22, 2015. The Back-End Mergers were
completed on January&nbsp;12, 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The JPI advance of the merger consideration plus accrued interest was deducted from the merger

allocations to the limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, as well as adjustments related to the interest expense on the Convertible Notes, if applicable (see Note 18&#151;&#147;Notes Payable, Collateralized and Short-Term Borrowings&#148;),
and expense related to dividend equivalents for certain RSUs, if applicable, as the numerator. The denominator is comprised of the Company&#146;s weighted-average outstanding shares of common stock and, if dilutive, the weighted-average number of
limited partnership interests and other contracts to issue shares of common stock, including Convertible Notes, stock options and RSUs. The limited partnership interests generally are potentially exchangeable into shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock
and are entitled to remaining earnings after the deduction for the Preferred Distribution; as a result, they are included in the fully diluted EPS computation to the extent that the effect would be dilutive. </P>

number of shares and units outstanding. The remaining redemptions along with the Class&nbsp;A common stock repurchases resulted in a 2.1&nbsp;million reduction in the fully diluted share count. This net reduction cost the Company approximately $18.1
million (or $8.53 per share/unit) during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. This reduction partially offset the overall growth in the fully diluted share count which resulted from acquisitions, equity based compensation and front office hires.

requirements to be accounted for as an equity instrument, and the Company classifies the conversion feature within &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. At the issuance of the
4.50% Convertible Notes, the embedded conversion feature was measured at approximately $19.0 million on a pre-tax basis ($16.1 million net of taxes and issuance costs) as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of a similar

fair value hierarchy are as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 1 measurements&#151;Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the
measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 2 measurements&#151;Quoted prices in markets that are not active
or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Level 3 measurements&#151;Prices
or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As required by FASB guidance,
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy financial assets and liabilities
accounted for at fair value under FASB guidance at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014 (in thousands): </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of the 8.75% Convertible Notes was estimated based on a jump-diffusion convertible pricing
model, which among other inputs incorporates the scheduled coupon and principal payments, the conversion feature inherent in the 8.75% Convertible Notes, the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock price and a stock price volatility assumption. The
stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historic volatility of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. The fair value measurements of the 8.75% Convertible Notes are based on significant inputs observable in the market and are
considered Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the Senior Notes and 4.50% Convertible Notes were determined using observable market prices as these securities are traded and are considered Level 1 and Level 2, respectively,
within the fair value hierarchy, based on whether they are deemed to be actively traded. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Convertible Notes </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;1, 2010, BGC Holdings issued an aggregate of $150.0 million principal amount of the 8.75% Convertible Notes to Cantor in a
private placement transaction. The Company used the proceeds of the 8.75% Convertible Notes to repay $150.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes that matured on April&nbsp;1, 2010. The 8.75% Convertible Notes were senior unsecured obligations
and ranked equally and ratably with all existing and future senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 8.75% Convertible Notes bore an annual interest rate of 8.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on April&nbsp;15 and October&nbsp;15 of each
year, beginning on October&nbsp;15, 2010. On April&nbsp;13, 2015, the Company&#146;s 8.75% Convertible Notes were fully converted into 24,042,599 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and issued to Cantor
Fitzgerald L.P. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 8.75% Convertible Notes of $3.8 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and $13.1 million for the years ending December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;29, 2011, the Company issued an aggregate of $160.0 million principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Notes due 2016. The 4.50%
Convertible Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 4.50% Convertible Notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.50%&nbsp;per annum and were priced at par. The 4.50% Convertible Notes will mature on July&nbsp;15, 2016,
unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or converted. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 4.50% Convertible Notes of $12.0 million, $11.9 million and $11.7 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,
respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the 4.50% Convertible Notes were convertible, at the holder&#146;s option, at a conversion
rate of 101.6260 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including stock dividends and stock splits on the Class&nbsp;A common stock and the Company&#146;s payment of
a quarterly cash dividend in excess of $0.17 per share of Class&nbsp;A common stock. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, or a combination thereof at the Company&#146;s
election. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the 4.50% Convertible Notes were convertible into approximately 16.3&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As prescribed by FASB guidance, <I>Debt</I>, the Company recognized the value of the embedded conversion feature of the 4.50% Convertible
Notes as an increase to &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; of approximately $19.0 million on a pre-tax basis ($16.1 million net of taxes and issuance costs). The embedded conversion feature was measured as the difference between the proceeds
received and the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion feature. The value of the conversion feature is treated as a debt discount and reduced the initial carrying value of the 4.50% Convertible Notes to $137.2 million, net of debt
issuance costs of $3.8 million allocated to the debt component of the instrument. The discount is amortized as interest cost and the carrying value of the 4.50% Convertible Notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the 4.50%
Convertible Notes. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the offering of the 4.50% Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped
call transactions, which are expected to reduce the potential dilution of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock upon any conversion of the 4.50% Convertible Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions ($10.78 as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The capped call
transactions had a cap price equal to $13.48 per share as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The purchase price of the capped call transactions resulted in a decrease to &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; of $11.4 million on a pre-tax basis ($9.9
million on an after-tax basis). The capped call transactions cover approximately 14.8&nbsp;million shares of BGC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. </P>

Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 8.125% Senior Notes may be redeemed for cash, in whole or in part, on or after June&nbsp;26, 2017, at the Company&#146;s option, at any time and from time to time, until maturity at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date. The 8.125% Senior Notes are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol &#147;BGCA.&#148; The Company used the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The initial carrying value of the 8.125% Senior Notes was $108.7 million, net of debt issuance costs of $3.8 million. The issuance costs are
amortized as interest cost, and the carrying value of the 8.125% Senior Notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the 8.125% Senior Notes. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 8.125% Senior Notes of $9.3 million for

June&nbsp;9, 2015. The interest rate payable on the notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time based on the debt rating assigned by specified rating agencies to the notes, as set forth in the Indenture. The 5.375% Senior Notes will
mature on December&nbsp;9, 2019. The Company may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time for cash at certain &#147;make-whole&#148; redemption prices (as set forth in the Indenture). If a &#147;Change of Control Triggering
Event&#148; (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest

debt issuance costs of $4.9 million. The issuance costs are amortized as interest cost, and the carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the notes. The Company recorded interest expense related to
the 5.375% Senior Notes of $17.1 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. There was no interest expense related to the 5.375% Senior Notes for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of the GFI acquisition, the Company assumed $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.375% Senior Notes (the &#147;8.375%
Senior Notes&#148;) due July 2018. The carrying value of these notes as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 was $255.3 million. Interest on these notes is payable, semi-annually in arrears on the 19th of January and July. Due to the cumulative effect of
downgrades to the credit rating of GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes, the 8.375% Senior Notes were subjected to 200 basis points penalty interest. On April&nbsp;28, 2015, a subsidiary of the Company purchased from GFI approximately 43.0&nbsp;million
new shares of GFI common stock. This increased BGC&#146;s ownership to approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock and gave us the ability to control the timing and process with respect to a full merger. Also on July&nbsp;10, 2015, the
Company guaranteed the obligations of GFI under the 8.375% Senior Notes. These actions resulted in upgrades of the credit ratings of GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes by Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings Inc. and Standard&nbsp;&amp;
Poor&#146;s, which reduced the penalty interest to 25 basis points effective July&nbsp;19, 2015. In addition, on January&nbsp;13, 2016, Moody&#146;s further upgraded the credit rating on GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes, eliminating the penalty
interest. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 8.375% Senior Notes of $19.2 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. </P>

pledged certain fixed assets as security for loans. The secured loan arrangements had fixed rates between 2.62% and 8.09%&nbsp;per annum and were repayable in consecutive monthly installments with the final payments due in December 2016. During the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company prepaid $1.5 million related to the secured loan arrangements; therefore, these secured loan arrangements were not outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 or 2014. The Company recorded interest expense
related to these secured loan arrangements of $4 thousand and $1.6 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, and 2013 respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;13, 2015, the Company entered into a new secured loan arrangement of $28.2 million under which it pledged certain fixed assets

December&nbsp;31, 2015. Except for the cash proceeds from the sale of Trayport, it is our intention to permanently reinvest these undistributed foreign pre-tax earnings in the Company&#146;s foreign operations.&nbsp;It is not practicable to
determine the amount of additional tax that may be payable in the event these earnings are repatriated due to the fluctuation of the relative ownership percentages of the foreign subsidiaries between the Company and BGC Holdings, L.P. With respect
to the sale of Trayport, management concluded that the foreign proceeds attributable to the sale of Trayport in the amount of $603.9 million will ultimately be repatriated and will provide U.S. tax on those amounts.&nbsp;For these proceeds which are
not permanently reinvested, the deferred tax liability for $135.5 million is net of foreign tax credits, which will be generated as a result of repatriation.&nbsp;In addition, certain GFI Group net operating loss carryforwards are expected to be
utilized to reduce cash taxes.&nbsp;Taking these items together, we therefore expect to pay effective cash taxes of no more than $64 million related to the Trayport purchase price, or an expected rate of less than 10 percent. </P>

temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded
against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Significant components of the

information is evaluated by management. The Company&#146;s operations consist of two reportable segments, Financial Services and Real Estate Services. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s Financial Services segment specializes in the brokerage of a broad range of products, including fixed income securities,
interest rate swaps, foreign exchange, equities, equity derivatives, credit derivatives, commodities, futures and structured products. It also provides a full range of services, including trade execution, broker-dealer services, clearing,
processing, information, and other back-office services to a broad range of financial and non-financial institutions. The Company&#146;s Real Estate Services segment offers commercial real estate tenants, owners, investors and developers a wide
range of services, including leasing and corporate advisory, investment sales and financial services, consulting, project and development management, and property and facilities management. </P>

&#147;Corporate Items&#148; category. Corporate revenues include fees from related parties and interest income as well as gains that are not considered part of the Company&#146;s ordinary, ongoing business such as the realized gain related to the
GFI shares owned by the Company prior to the completion of the tender offer to acquire GFI on February&nbsp;26, 2015 and the gain related to the disposition of the equity interests in the entities that make up the Trayport business. Corporate
expenses include non-cash compensation expenses (such as the grant of exchangeability to limited partnership units; redemption/exchange of partnership units, issuance of restricted shares and a reserve on compensation-related partnership loans; and
allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs) as well as unallocated expenses such as certain professional and consulting fees, executive compensation and interest expense, which are managed separately at the corporate level. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;12, 2016, the Company, JPI, New JP Inc. (&#147;New JPI&#148;), Michael A. Gooch, Colin Heffron, and certain subsidiaries of JPI
and the Company closed on a previously agreed upon merger. This merger provided for the acquisition of JPI by the Company as provided for by the merger agreement dated December&nbsp;22, 2015. Shortly following the completion of the JPI Merger, a
subsidiary of the Company merged with and into GFI pursuant to a short-form merger under Delaware law, with GFI continuing as the surviving entity. The Back-End Mergers allowed the Company to acquire the remaining approximately 33 percent of the
outstanding shares of GFI common stock that it did not already own. Following the closing of the Back-End Mergers, the Company and its affiliates now own 100 percent of the outstanding shares of GFI&#146;s common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the merger agreement, certain subsidiaries of the Company merged with and into a subsidiary of New JPI, resulting in the
Company owning all of the shares of GFI common stock previously owned by JPI. In the JPI Merger, each holder of JPI common stock, other than Messrs. Gooch and Heffron, received per JPI share held an amount equal to (a)&nbsp;$6.10 multiplied by the
number of GFI shares held by JPI, less the principal plus accrued interest on the $10.75 million note issued by JPI to the Company on October&nbsp;6, 2015, divided by (b)&nbsp;the number of outstanding shares of New JPI common stock. This amount was
paid 30 percent in cash and 70 percent in shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock, valued at a price of $9.46 per share of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock, which was the closing price of BGC Class&nbsp;A Common Stock on the day prior to the date of
the Tender Offer Agreement, dated as of February&nbsp;19, 2015, by and among BGC, BGC Partners, L.P. and GFI. Messrs. Gooch and Heffron received the same amount per JPI share held, subject to certain adjustments, but were paid 100 percent in shares
of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock. In total, approximately 23.5&nbsp;million shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock and $111.3 million in cash were issued or paid with respect to the closing of the Back-End Mergers, inclusive of adjustments. The
total purchase consideration for all shares of GFI purchased by the Company was approximately $750 million, net of the $250.0 million note previously issued to GFI by the Company, which is eliminated in consolidation. The approximately $750 million
purchase consideration excludes the $29.0 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2015 with respect to the appreciation of the 17.1&nbsp;million shares of GFI held by the Company prior to the successful completion of the tender offer.
Including this gain, the calculation of purchase consideration and noncontrolling interest totaled $779.5 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;12,
2016, we filed a resale registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which 23,481,192 shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock may be offered and sold from time to time by the JPI Stockholders for their own account or by certain pledgees, donees,
transferees, or other successors in interest of the shares, including banks or other financial institutions which may enter into stock pledge or other financing transactions with the JPI Stockholders. </P>

the closing, the Company made a payment of $6.5 million to LFI.&nbsp;As a result of the option exercise, the Company has a 20% ownership interest in LFI. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February 25, 2016, the Company entered into a committed unsecured credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and
a syndicate of lenders. Several of the Company&#146;s domestic non-regulated subsidiaries are parties to the credit agreement as guarantors. The credit agreement provides for maximum revolving loans of $150 million, with the option to increase the
aggregate loans to $200 million. The maturity date of the facility is February&nbsp;25, 2018. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at either LIBOR or a defined base rate plus an additional margin which ranges from 50 basis points to 250
basis points depending on the Company&#146;s debt rating as determined by S&amp;P and Fitch and whether such loan is a LIBOR loan or a base rate loan. Contemporaneously with the closing of this credit agreement, the $25 million unsecured credit
agreement entered into on December&nbsp;24, 2015 with Bank of America, N.A. as lender was terminated. As of February&nbsp;29, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under either this $150 million facility or the terminated $25 million facility.

Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 based upon criteria set forth in the Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)
(COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on the results of our 2015 evaluation, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. We reviewed the results of management&#146;s assessment with our Audit Committee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Management has excluded BGC Partners&#146; acquisitions of Computerized Facility Integration, LLC (&#147;CFI&#148;) and Excess Space Retail
Services, Inc. (&#147;Excess Space&#148;), as these acquisitions were completed during the course of 2015, and did not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in 2015. However, we anticipate that these
acquisitions will be included in management&#146;s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our audit of internal controls over financial reporting for 2016. The aggregate 2015 GAAP revenues, recognized by CFI and Excess Space
from the dates of acquisition, represented approximately 0.7% or $18.6 million of the Company&#146;s total GAAP revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. </P>

and were repayable in consecutive monthly installments with the final payments due in December 2016. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company prepaid $1.5 million related to the secured loan arrangements; therefore, these secured
loan arrangements were not outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 or 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;13, 2015, subsidiaries of the Company entered

the Company terminated the leases and prepaid the outstanding balance of $7.2 million. Because the leases were terminated during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company had no outstanding balance or fixed assets related to the leases as
of December&nbsp;31, 2014 nor December&nbsp;31, 2015. The Company recorded interest expense of $0.7 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the 4.50% Convertible Notes were convertible, at the holder&#146;s
option, at a conversion rate of 101.6260 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including stock dividends and stock splits on the Class&nbsp;A common stock and the
Company&#146;s payment of a quarterly cash dividend in excess of $0.17 per share of Class&nbsp;A common stock. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, or a combination thereof at
the Company&#146;s election. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the 4.50% Convertible Notes were convertible into approximately 16.3&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As prescribed by FASB guidance, Debt, the Company recognized the value of the embedded conversion feature of the 4.50% Convertible Notes as an
increase to &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; of approximately $19.0 million on a pre-tax basis ($16.1 million net of taxes and issuance costs). The embedded conversion feature was measured as the difference between the proceeds received and
the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion feature. The value of the conversion feature is treated as a debt discount and reduced the initial carrying value of the 4.50% Convertible Notes to $137.2 million, net of debt issuance
costs of $3.8 million allocated to the debt component of the instrument. The discount is amortized as interest cost and the carrying value of the 4.50% Convertible notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the notes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the offering of the 4.50% Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions, which are expected to
reduce the potential dilution of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock upon any conversion of the 4.50% Convertible Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, as measured under the
terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions ($10.78 as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The capped call transactions had a cap price equal to
$13.48 per share as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The purchase price of the capped call transactions resulted in a decrease to &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; of $11.4 million on a pre-tax basis ($9.9 million on an after-tax basis). The capped
call transactions cover approximately 14.8&nbsp;million shares of BGC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;26, 2012, the Company issued an aggregate of $112.5 million principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2042. The 8.125% Senior

redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date. The 8.125% Senior Notes are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol &#147;BGCA.&#148; The Company used the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The initial carrying value of the 8.125% Senior Notes was $108.7 million, net of debt issuance costs of $3.8 million. The issuance costs are
amortized as interest cost, and the carrying value of the 8.125% Senior Notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the notes. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 8.125% Senior Notes of $9.3 million for the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;9, 2014, the Company issued an aggregate of $300.0 million
principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2019 (&#147;the 5.375% Senior Notes&#148;). The 5.375% Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. These Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.375%&nbsp;per year, payable in
cash on June&nbsp;9 and December&nbsp;9 of each year, commencing June&nbsp;9, 2015. The interest rate payable on the notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time based on the debt rating assigned by specified rating agencies to the notes,
as set forth in the Indenture. The 5.375% Senior Notes will mature on December&nbsp;9, 2019. The Company may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time for cash at certain &#147;make-whole&#148; redemption prices (as set forth
in the Indenture). If a &#147;Change of Control Triggering Event&#148; (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the
notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The initial carrying value of the 5.375%
