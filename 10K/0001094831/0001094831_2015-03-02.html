<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The voice brokerage business within our Financial Services segment originates from one of the oldest and most established inter-dealer franchises in the
financial intermediary industry. Cantor started our wholesale intermediary brokerage operations in 1972. In 1996, Cantor launched the eSpeed system, which revolutionized the way government bonds are traded in the inter-dealer market by providing a
fully electronic trading marketplace. eSpeed, Inc. completed an initial public offering in 1999 and began trading on NASDAQ, yet remained one of Cantor&#146;s controlled subsidiaries. Following eSpeed&#146;s initial public offering, Cantor continued
to operate its inter-dealer voice brokerage business separately from eSpeed. In August 2004, Cantor announced the reorganization and separation of its inter-dealer voice brokerage business into a subsidiary called &#147;BGC,&#148; in honor of B.
Gerald Cantor, the pioneer in screen brokerage services and fixed income market data products. In April 2008, BGC and certain other Cantor assets merged with and into eSpeed, and the combined company began operating under the name &#147;BGC
Partners, Inc.&#148; In June 2013, BGC sold certain assets relating to its U.S. Treasury benchmark business and the name eSpeed to the NASDAQ OMX Group (see &#147;NASDAQ OMX Transaction&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001, our financial brokerage business was widely recognized as one of the leading full-service wholesale
inter-dealer brokers in the world, with a rich history of developing innovative technological and financial solutions. After September&nbsp;11, 2001 and the loss of the majority of our U.S.-based employees, our voice financial brokerage business
operated primarily in Europe. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since the formation of BGC in 2004, we have substantially rebuilt our U.S. presence and have continued to expand our global
footprint through the acquisition and integration of established brokerage companies and the hiring of experienced brokers. Through these actions, we have been able to expand our presence in key markets and position our Financial Services business
for sustained growth. Recent acquisitions include: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

&#147;Shares&#148;), of GFI Group Inc. (&#147;GFI&#148;) for $6.10 per share in cash and accepted for purchase approximately 54.6&nbsp;million shares (the &#147;Tendered Shares&#148;) tendered to us pursuant to our offer (the &#147;Offer&#148;). The
Tendered Shares, together with the 17.1&nbsp;million Shares already owned by us, represent approximately 56.3% of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares. We expect to issue payment for the Tendered Shares on March&nbsp;3, 2015 in the aggregate amount of
$332.8 million. GFI is a leading intermediary and provider of trading technologies and support services to the global OTC and listed markets. GFI serves more than 2,500 institutional clients in operating electronic and hybrid markets for cash and
derivative products across multiple asset classes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">GFI will be a controlled company of ours and will operate as our division, reporting to Shaun Lynn,
our President. Its financial results will be consolidated with ours. Going forward, BGC and GFI are expected to remain separately branded divisions. Founded in 1987 and headquartered in New York, GFI employs over 2,000 people globally, with
additional offices in London, Paris, Brussels, Nyon, Dublin, Madrid, Sugar Land (TX), Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Dubai, Manila, Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney, Cape Town, Santiago, Bogota, Buenos Aires, Lima and Mexico City. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;19, 2015, we and one of our subsidiaries entered into a Tender Offer Agreement with GFI (the &#147;TO Agreement&#148;). Pursuant to the TO
Agreement, the board of directors of GFI unanimously agreed to support our Offer and to expand GFI&#146;s board and our designation of certain members. The TO Agreement also contained an offer extension and a reduction to the minimum tender
condition of the Offer. We have designated six directors to the expanded eight-member GFI board. These new GFI board members are Howard Lutnick, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Shaun Lynn, our President, Stephen Merkel, our Executive Vice
President, General Counsel and Secretary, William J. Moran, the former Executive Vice President of JPMorgan Chase&nbsp;&amp; Co. and our current director and Audit Committee Co-Chairman, Peter J. Powers, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Powers Global Strategies LLC and Michael Snow, Managing Member and Chief Investment Officer of Snow Fund One, LLC. Messrs. Moran, Powers and Snow are independent directors. The other conditions of the TO Agreement were met. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">GFI&#146;s current Executive Chairman, Michael Gooch, and its current Chief Executive Officer, Colin Heffron, will remain as executives and directors of GFI
and shall continue as Chairman and CEO, respectively, of the GFI division. Mr.&nbsp;Gooch shall also hold the title of Vice Chairman of BGC Partners, L.P. Mr.&nbsp;Heffron will enter into an amended and restated GFI employment agreement which will
continue to provide him with certain annual cash and equity compensation and severance arrangements. Mr.&nbsp;Gooch will enter into a fixed term employment agreement which will provide him with certain cash and equity compensation. Pursuant to the
TO Agreement, BGC has agreed to promptly establish a Distributable Earnings Bonus Pool (the &#147;Pool&#148;) program in an amount equal to one times the average annual distributable earnings as defined of the GFI inter-dealer brokerage business for
the three successive 12-month periods beginning on July&nbsp;1, 2015. The Pool will be in the form of an award of restricted equity units and preferred restricted equity units of BGC Holdings, L.P and will be allocated 35% to Mr.&nbsp;Gooch, 35% to
Mr.&nbsp;Heffron and 30% to other GFI employees as mutually agreed by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron and BGC. As a condition to participation in the Pool, each participant (including Messrs. Gooch and Heffron) is required to enter into a non-competition
and award agreement containing the terms and conditions of his or her participation, which terms include the participant&#146;s continued employment through July&nbsp;1, 2018 and certain conditions, obligations and covenants (including
non-competition, non-solicitation, non-hire non-disclosure provisions). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prior to the entry into the TO Agreement, GFI was previously a party to a series
of agreements, including an Agreement and Plan of Merger and a Purchase Agreement (the &#147;CME Merger Agreement&#148;), each dated July&nbsp;30, 2014, as amended, with CME Group Inc. (&#147;CME&#148;) and certain of its affiliates, whereby GFI had
agreed to merge with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of CME and, immediately following such merger, a private consortium of current GFI management would acquire from CME GFI&#146;s wholesale brokerage and clearing businesses (such transactions
collectively, the &#147;CME Transaction&#148;). In addition, CME, Jersey Partners, Inc. (&#147;JPI&#148;) and certain other stockholders of GFI, who collectively control approximately 38% of GFI&#146;s issued and outstanding Shares, entered into an
agreement, dated July&nbsp;30, 2014 (the &#147;Support Agreement&#148;), that provided for such stockholders to vote for the CME Transaction and vote against any alternative transaction and that prevented such stockholders from transferring their
Shares, including by tendering into the Offer. The CME Merger Agreement and the CME Transaction were terminated on January&nbsp;30, 2015. The restrictions in the Support Agreement continue until on or about January&nbsp;30, 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the TO Agreement, JPI has the right to request, within the period of 21 days following the earlier of (x)&nbsp;the expiration or termination of the
Support Agreement or (y)&nbsp;February&nbsp;19, 2016, that we complete a back-end merger in which each remaining Share would be converted into $6.10, with holders of Shares (other than JPI) receiving cash, and holders of JPI common stock receiving a
mix of cash and shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock (&#147;BGC Stock&#148;) valued at the closing price of BGC Stock on the date prior to the date of the TO Agreement in respect of each Share indirectly owned by such holder through JPI. The
amount of consideration to be received by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron, as holders of JPI common stock, in the back-end merger is subject to reduction in certain circumstances, and our obligation to pay consideration to such holders in the back-end
merger is also subject to certain conditions, each as described in the TO Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the TO Agreement, we will execute certain ancillary
agreements, including amendments to our existing administrative services agreement and the Tower Bridge administrative services agreements between us and our various affiliates and subsidiaries, including Cantor and its affiliates. GFI employees
holding RSUs will receive $6.10 per RSU in cash based on their pre-existing vesting schedules. We and GFI have also agreed that GFI will establish a retention bonus pool for employees of GFI, which may be payable in the forms of forgivable loans and
equity or partnership awards of us or our affiliates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>NASDAQ OMX Transaction </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;28, 2013, we completed the sale (the &#147;NASDAQ OMX Transaction&#148;) of certain assets to The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (&#147;NASDAQ OMX&#148;).
At the closing, NASDAQ OMX purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our affiliates, including the eSpeed brand name and various assets comprising the fully electronic portion of our benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasury
brokerage, market data and co-location service businesses (the &#147;Purchased Assets&#148;), for cash consideration of $750 million paid at closing, plus an earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock to be paid ratably in each
of the fifteen years following the closing. The $750 million in cash paid at closing was subject to adjustment for certain pre-paid amounts and accrued costs and expenses, and the 14,883,705 shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock will be paid ratably in
each of the fifteen years following the closing in which the consolidated gross revenue of NASDAQ OMX, as a whole, is equal to or greater than $25 million. On each of November&nbsp;12, 2013 and November&nbsp;10, 2014, we received 992,247 shares of
NASDAQ OMX common stock in accordance with the agreement. The contingent future issuances of NASDAQ OMX common stock are also subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events, including the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of
NASDAQ OMX&#146;s stock (including by merger), NASDAQ OMX ceasing to hold Purchased Assets representing 50% or more of the aggregate revenue attributable to the Purchased Assets as of the closing, and the sale of all or substantially all of NASDAQ
OMX&#146;s assets, as well as to certain anti-dilution provisions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of the NASDAQ OMX Transaction, we only sold our on-the-run, benchmark 2-,
3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 30-year fully electronic trading platform for U.S. Treasury notes and bonds. Over time, we have built these six instruments into some of the deepest and most liquid markets in the world. This platform, together with the directly
related market data and co-location businesses, generated approximately $99 million in revenues in 2012 and $48.6 million in revenues in the first six months of 2013. We retain all of our other voice, hybrid, and fully electronic trading, market
data, and software businesses, including voice, hybrid and electronic brokerage of off-the-run U.S. Treasuries, as well as Treasury Bills, Treasury Swaps, Treasury Repos, Treasury Spreads, and Treasury Rolls. We also continue to offer voice
brokerage for on-the-run U.S. Treasuries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Overview of Our Products and Services </B></P>

turn publish to a normalized, global market data distribution platform, allowing prices and rates to be distributed to our proprietary network, data vendor pages, secure websites and trading applications as indicative pricing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Inter-Dealer Trading Technology.</I></B> We utilize a sophisticated proprietary electronic trading platform to provide execution and market data
services to our customers. The services are available through the proprietary API, FIX and a multi-asset proprietary trading platform, BGC Trader. The platform presently supports a wide and constantly expanding range of products and services, which
includes FX Options, European corporate bonds, European CDS, interest rate swaps in multiple currencies, US REPO, TIPS, MBS, and other products. Every product on the platform is supported in either view-only, hybrid/managed or fully electronic mode,
and can be transitioned from one mode to the next in response to market demands. The flexible BGC technology stack is designed to support feature-rich workflows required by the hybrid mode as well as delivering high throughput and low transaction
latency required by the fully-electronic mode. Trades executed by our customers in any mode are eligible for immediate electronic confirmation through direct straight-through processing (&#147;STP&#148;) links as well as STP hubs. The BGC trading
platform services are operated out of several globally distributed datacenters and delivered to customers over BGC&#146;s global private network, third-party connectivity providers as well as the Internet. BGC&#146;s proprietary graphical user
interfaces and the API/FIX connectivity are deployed at hundreds of major banks and institutions and service thousands of users. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Post-Trade
Technology.</I></B> Our platform automates previously paper and telephone-based transaction processing, confirmation and other functions, substantially improving and reducing the cost of many of our customers&#146; back offices and enabling STP. In
addition to our own system, confirmation and trade processing is also available through third-party hubs, including Swapswire, T-Zero, Reuters RTNS, Logicscope and STP in FIX for various banks. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have electronic connections to most mainstream clearinghouses, including The Depository Trust&nbsp;&amp; Clearing Corporation (&#147;DTCC&#148;), CLS
Group, Euroclear, Clearstream, Monte Titoli, LCH.Clearnet, Eurex Clearing, CME Clearing and the Options Clearing Corporation (&#147;OCC&#148;). As more products become centrally cleared, and as our customers request that we use a particular venue,
we expect to expand the number of clearinghouses to which we connect in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Systems Architecture.</I></B> Our systems consist of layered
components, which provide matching, credit management, market data distribution, position reporting, customer display and customer integration. The private network currently operates from four concurrent core data centers (two of which are in
London, one of which is in Rochelle Park, New Jersey, which we have rights to use until June 2015 pursuant to an agreement with NASDAQ OMX, and one of which is in Trumbull, Connecticut) and six hub cities throughout the world acting as distribution
points for all private network customers. After June 2015, we plan to transfer the Rochelle Park data center to a co-location center in New Jersey. Our network hubs beyond the core data centers are in Chicago, Hong Kong, S&#259;o Paolo, Singapore,
Tokyo and Toronto. The redundant structure of our system provides multiple backup paths and re-routing of data transmission in the event of failure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition to our own network system, we also receive and distribute secure trading information from customers using the services of multiple, major Internet service providers throughout the world. These connections enable us to offer our products and
services via the Internet to our global customers. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We devote substantial efforts to the development and improvement of our hybrid and electronic marketplaces and licensed software products and services. We work
with our customers to identify their specific requirements and make modifications to our software, network distribution systems and technologies that are responsive to those needs. Our efforts focus on internal development, strategic partnering,
acquisitions and licensing. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we employed approximately 350 technology professionals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our Intellectual Property </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have adopted a comprehensive intellectual property program to protect our proprietary technology. We currently have licenses covering various Cantor patents
in the United States, including patents relating to (1)&nbsp;a system and method for auction-based trading of specialized items such as fixed income instruments and (2)&nbsp;a fixed income portfolio index processor. Foreign counterpart applications
for some of these U.S. patents have been filed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have agreements to license technology that may be covered by several pending and/or issued U.S.
patent applications relating to various aspects of our electronic trading systems, including both functional and design aspects. We have filed a number of patent applications to further protect our proprietary technology and innovations, and have
received patents for some of those applications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our patent portfolio is growing and consists of numerous patents and patent applications relating to our
core businesses and to other businesses. We continue to look for opportunities to license and/or otherwise monetize these and other patents in our portfolio. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Credit Risk </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit risk arises from potential
non-performance by counterparties and customers. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to credit risk. We maintain a thorough credit approval process to limit exposure to counterparty risk and employ stringent monitoring
to control the counterparty risk from our matched principal and agency businesses. Our account opening and counterparty approval process includes verification of key customer identification, anti-money laundering verification checks and a credit
review of financial and operating data. The credit review process includes establishing an internal credit rating and any other information deemed necessary to make an informed credit decision, which may include correspondence, due diligence calls
and a visit to the entity&#146;s premises, as necessary. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit approval is granted subject to certain trading limits and may be subject to additional
conditions, such as the receipt of collateral or other credit support. Ongoing credit monitoring procedures include reviewing periodic financial statements and publicly available information on the client and collecting data from credit rating
agencies, where available, to assess the ongoing financial condition of the client. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Principal Transaction Risk </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through our subsidiaries, we execute matched principal transactions in which we act as a &#147;middleman&#148; by serving as counterparty to both a buyer and a
seller in matching back-to-back trades. These transactions are then settled through a recognized settlement system or third-party clearing organization. Settlement typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade date. Cash
settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. We generally avoid settlement of principal transactions on a free-of-payment basis or by physical delivery of the underlying instrument.
However, free-of-payment transactions may occur on a very limited basis. </P>
 <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">16 </P>

<h5 align="left"><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The number of matched principal trades we execute has continued to grow as compared to prior years. Receivables
from broker-dealers and clearing organizations and payables to broker-dealers and clearing organizations on our consolidated statements of financial condition primarily represent the simultaneous purchase and sale of the securities associated with
those matched principal transactions that have not settled as of their stated settlement dates. Our experience has been that substantially all of these transactions ultimately settle at the contracted amounts. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Market Risk </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market risk refers to the risk that a change
in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses for a specified position. In our Financial Services business, we may allow certain of our desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the
ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are primarily for the purpose of managing proprietary positions, facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting
additional order flow. As a result, we may have market risk exposure on these transactions. Our exposure varies based on the size of our overall positions, the risk characteristics of the instruments held and the amount of time the positions are
held before they are disposed of. We have limited ability to track our exposure to market risk and unmatched positions on an intra-day basis; however, we attempt to mitigate market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited
holding periods and hedging our exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades,
we may not be able to unwind the position and we may be forced to hold the position for a longer period than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have investments in marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and which had a fair value of $144.7 million as of December&nbsp;31,
2014. Investments in marketable securities carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that the marketable securities will not lose value and, in general, securities markets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result of these different
market risks, our holdings of marketable securities could be materially and adversely affected. We seek to minimize the effect of price changes on a portion of our investments in marketable securities through the use of derivative contracts.
However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with our investments in marketable securities. See Note 10&#151;&#147;Marketable Securities&#148; and Note
12&#151;&#147;Derivatives&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these investments and related hedging activities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our risk management procedures and strict limits are designed to monitor and limit the risk of unintended loss and have been effective in the past. However,
there is no assurance that these procedures and limits will be effective at limiting unanticipated losses in the future. Adverse movements in the securities positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a
substantial loss. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for any particular
reporting period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Operational Risk </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Financial
Services businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies on a daily basis. If any of our data processing systems does not operate properly or is disabled
or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational
damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of
our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, despite our contingency plans, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a
disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with whom
we conduct business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our
computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures such as software programs, firewalls and similar technology to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients&#146; information, the nature of the
threats continue to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability or disruption
of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code, cyber attaches and other events that could have an adverse security impact. There have also been an increasing number of malicious cyber incidents in recent years in various
industries, including ours. Any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties important to our businesses, could present risks to our operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Foreign Currency Risk </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are exposed to risks associated
with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency rates create volatility in the U.S. dollar equivalent of our revenues and expenses in particular with regard to British Pounds, Swiss francs and Euros. In addition, changes in the
remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated net assets are recorded as part of our results of operations and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. We monitor the net exposure in foreign currencies on a daily basis and may hedge our
exposure as deemed appropriate with highly rated major financial institutions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Interest Rate Risk </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We had $706.7 million in fixed-rate debt outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. These debt obligations are not currently subject to fluctuations in interest
rates, although in the event of refinancing or issuance of new debt, such debt could be subject to changes in interest rates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Disaster Recovery
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our processes address disaster recovery concerns. We operate most of our technology from dual-primary data centers at our two different London
locations. Either site alone is capable of running all of our essential systems. In addition, we maintain technology operations from data centers in New Jersey and Connecticut. Replicated instances of this technology are maintained in our London
data centers. All data centers are built and equipped to best-practice standards of physical security with appropriate environmental monitoring and safeguards. Failover for the majority of our systems is automated. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We encounter competition in all aspects of our businesses. In our Financial Services businesses, we compete primarily with other inter-dealer brokers,
including for brokers, salespeople, and suitable acquisition candidates. Our existing and potential competitors are numerous and include other inter-dealer brokerage firms, multi-dealer trading companies, technology companies and market data and
information vendors, securities and futures exchanges, electronic communications networks, crossing systems, software companies, consortia, business-to-business marketplace infrastructure companies and niche market energy and other commodity
Internet-based trading systems. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Inter-Dealer Brokers </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Financial Services segment primarily competes with four major, diversified inter-dealer brokers. These inter-dealer brokers are ICAP plc, Tullett Prebon
plc (&#147;Tullett&#148;), GFI and Compagnie Financi&egrave;re Tradition (which is majority owned by Viel&nbsp;&amp; Cie), all of which are currently publicly traded companies. Other inter-dealer broker competitors include a number of smaller,
private firms that tend to specialize in specific product areas or geographies. On February&nbsp;26, 2015, we completed our tender offer to acquire GFI. See &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148; On January&nbsp;15, 2015, we entered into a
settlement agreement with Tullett that resolved all ten outstanding lawsuits between the two companies. In exchange for our settlement payment, we agreed with Tullett for a period of one year not to hire senior employees, including desk heads, of
the other party and its subsidiaries, which would include employees of GFI should we close on our acquisition of GFI. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Demand for services of brokers is
directly affected by national and international economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in and uncertainty regarding tax laws and substantial fluctuations in the
volume and price levels of securities transactions. Other significant factors affecting competition in the brokerage industry are the quality and ability of professional personnel, the depth and pricing efficiency of the markets in which the brokers
transact, the strength of the technology used to service and execute on those markets and the relative prices of products and services offered by the brokers and by competing markets and trading processes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Market Data Vendors </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The majority of our large
inter-dealer broker competitors also sell proprietary market data and information, which competes with our market data offerings. In addition to direct sales, we resell market data through large market data and information providers. These companies
have established significant presences on the vast majority of trading desks in our industry. Some of these market data and information providers, such as Bloomberg L.P. and Thomson Reuters Corporation, include in their product mix electronic
trading and execution of both OTC and listed products in addition to their traditional market data offerings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Exchanges </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although our businesses will often use exchanges to execute transactions brokered in both listed and OTC markets, we believe that exchanges have sought and
will seek to migrate products traditionally traded in OTC markets by inter-dealer brokers to exchanges. However, we believe that when a product goes from OTC - to exchange-traded, the underlying or related OTC market often continues to experience
growth in line with the growth of the exchange-traded contract. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (&#147;ICE&#148;) operates both regulated exchanges and OTC execution services, and in the latter it competes directly with inter-dealer
brokers in energy, commodities, and credit products. ICE entered these OTC markets primarily by acquiring independent OTC brokers, and we believe that it is likely ICE or other exchange operators may seek to compete with us in the future by
acquiring other such brokers, by creating futures products designed to mimic OTC products, or through other means. Further, ICE also operates a swap execution facility (&#147;SEF&#148;), and we expect that other exchanges may also seek to do so. In
connection with the NASDAQ OMX Transaction, we agreed that, for three years after the closing, we and Cantor will not engage in the business of fully electronic brokerage of benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasuries and certain transactions in first
off-the-run U.S. Treasuries, subject to certain exceptions. See &#147;NASDAQ OMX Transaction.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Banks and Broker-Dealers </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Banks and broker-dealers have in the past created and/or funded consortia to compete with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers.&nbsp;For example, ICAP plc&#146;s
inter-dealer businesses for fully electronic trading of U.S. Treasuries and spot foreign exchange both began as dealer-owned consortia before being acquired by ICAP plc.&nbsp;An example of a current and similar consortium is Tradeweb Markets LLC
(&#147;Tradeweb&#148;).&nbsp;Currently, several large banks hold stakes in Tradeweb, an Internet-based market intermediary.&nbsp;Thomson Reuters Corporation is Tradeweb&#146;s single largest shareholder. Although Tradeweb operates primarily as a
dealer to customer platform, some of its offerings include a voice and electronic inter-dealer platform. Tradeweb also operates a SEF. In addition, Tradeweb&#146;s management has said that it would like to expand into other inter-dealer markets, and
as such may compete with us in other areas over time. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Overall, we believe that we may also face future competition from market data and technology companies and some
securities brokerage firms, some of which are currently our customers, as well as from any future strategic alliances, joint ventures or other partnerships created by one or more of our potential or existing competitors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Real Estate Services </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our Real Estate Services
segment, we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry, including commercial property and corporate facilities management, occupier and property/agency leasing, property sales, valuation, capital
markets (equity and debt) solutions, development services and proprietary research. Each business discipline is highly competitive on a national, regional and local level. Depending on the geography, property type or service, we face competition
from other commercial real estate service providers, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings; in-house corporate real estate
departments; developers; institutional lenders; insurance companies; investment banking firms; investment managers; and accounting and consulting firms. Despite recent consolidation, the commercial real estate services industry remains highly
fragmented and competitive. Although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are more entrenched on a local or regional basis. We are also subject to competition from other large
multi-national firms that have similar service competencies to ours, including CBRE Group, Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, Cushman&nbsp;&amp; Wakefield (majority-owned by EXOR S.p.A.), DTZ and Colliers International (part of FirstService
Corporation). In addition, specialized firms like HFF, Inc. and Eastdil Secured LLC (part of Wells Fargo&nbsp;&amp; Company) compete with us in certain areas. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Partnership Overview </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our partnership
structure is one of the unique strengths of our business. Many of our key brokers, salespeople, managers and other front office professionals have their own capital invested in our business, aligning their interests with our stockholders. Limited
partnership interests in BGC Holdings consist of: (i)&nbsp;&#147;founding/working partner units&#148; held by limited partners who are employees; (ii)&nbsp;&#147;limited partnership units,&#148; which consist of a variety of units that are generally
held by employees such as REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs; (iii)&nbsp;&#147;Cantor units&#148; which are the exchangeable limited partnership interests held by Cantor entities; and (iv)&nbsp;preferred
partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;), which are working partner units that may be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with, the grant of REUs, RPUs,, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs, ARPUs and NPSUs. See our
Organizational Structure. We also have NPSUs, which are partnership units that are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions, not allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be exchangeable into shares of our Common Stock. Upon
grant, NPSUs may be assigned a written vesting schedule pursuant to which a certain number of NPSUs would be converted for limited partnership units on each vesting date, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the
Partnership in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our partnership structure is an effective tool in recruiting, motivating and retaining key employees. Many brokers are attracted by the
opportunity to become partners because the partnership agreement generally entitles partners to quarterly distributions of income from the partnership. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests generally entitle our partners to participate in
distributions of income from the operations of our business, upon leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests as described below), any such partners are only entitled to receive over time, and
provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such partner&#146;s capital account or compensatory grant awards, excluding any goodwill or going
concern value of our business unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and we, as the general partner of BGC Holdings, otherwise determine. Our partners can receive the right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests
for shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock (if, in the case of founding partners, Cantor so determines and, in the case of working partners and limited partnership unit holders, the BGC Holdings general partner, with Cantor&#146;s consent,
determines otherwise) and thereby realize any higher value associated with our Class&nbsp;A common stock. We believe that, having invested in us, partners feel a sense of responsibility for the health and performance of our business and have a
strong incentive to maximize our revenues and profitability. </P>

the United States is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws. As registered broker-dealers and a Futures Commissions Merchant, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations which cover all aspects of
financial services, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers&#146; funds and securities, minimum capital requirements, recordkeeping, business practices, securities lending and financing of securities purchases and
the conduct of associated persons. We and our subsidiaries also are subject to the various anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, certain state securities laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. We also may be subject to vicarious and controlling person liability for the activities of our subsidiaries and our officers, employees and affiliated persons. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal securities laws, including adopting rules and regulations applicable to
broker-dealers (other than government securities broker-dealers) and enforcing both its rules regarding broker-dealers and the Treasury&#146;s rules regarding government securities broker-dealers. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by
state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have registered to do business. In addition, Treasury rules relating to trading government securities apply to such activities when engaged in by broker-dealers. The
Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal commodities future laws, including the adoption of rules applicable to Futures Commissions Merchants and
Designated Contract Markets such as ELX. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Much of the regulation of broker-dealers&#146; operations in the United States has been delegated to
self-regulatory organizations. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) that govern the operations of broker-dealers and government securities broker-dealers and conduct periodic inspections and
examinations of their operations. In the case of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, the principal self-regulatory organization is FINRA. FINRA was formed from the consolidation of the NASD&#146;s member regulation operations and the regulatory arm
of the NYSE Group to act as the self-regulatory organization for all broker-dealers doing business within the United States. Accordingly, our U.S. subsidiaries are subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the SEC and FINRA. In our
futures-related activities, our subsidiaries are also subject to the rules of the CFTC, futures exchanges of which they are members and the National Futures Association (&#147;NFA&#148;), a futures self-regulatory organization. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The changing regulatory environment, new laws that may be passed by Congress, and rules that may be promulgated by the SEC, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, the CFTC, the NFA, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, if adopted, may directly affect operations, and profitability and those of our
competitors and customers and of the securities markets in which we participate in a way that could adversely affect our businesses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The SEC,
self-regulatory organizations and state securities administrators conduct informal and formal investigations of possible improprieties or illegal action by broker-dealers and their &#147;associated persons,&#148; which could be followed by the
institution of administrative, civil and/or criminal proceedings against broker-dealers and/or &#147;associated persons.&#148; Among the sanctions that may result if administrative, civil or criminal proceedings

were ever instituted against us or our &#147;associated persons&#148; are injunctions, censure, fines, penalties, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension or expulsion from the
industry and, in rare instances, even imprisonment. The principal purpose of regulating and disciplining broker-dealers is to protect customers and the securities markets, rather than to protect broker-dealers or their creditors or equity holders.
From time to time, our &#147;associated persons&#148; have been and are subject to routine investigations, none of which to date have had a material adverse effect on our businesses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In light of recent events in the U.S. and global financial markets, regulators and legislators in the U.S. and European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) continue to
craft new laws and regulations for the global OTC derivatives markets, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), which became law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates or encourages
several reforms regarding derivatives, including new regulations for swaps markets creating impartiality considerations, additional pre- and post-trade transparency requirements and heightened collateral or capital standards, as well as
recommendations for the obligatory use of central clearing for most standardized derivatives. The law also requires that standardized derivatives be traded in an open and non-exclusionary manner on a regulated exchange or a SEF. The SEC and CFTC are
still in the process of finalizing rules for the implementation of these requirements. The actual implementation of such rules may be phased in over a longer period. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, while the recently adopted Volcker Rule will not apply directly to us, the Volcker Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other
institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be a continued uncertainty regarding the Volcker Rule, its impact on various affected businesses, how those businesses will respond to it, and the effect that it will have on the markets
in which we do business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Derivative Markets, L.P. (&#147;BGC Derivative Markets&#148;), our subsidiary, began operating as a SEF on October&nbsp;2,
2013. Since then, mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants commenced in February 2014 for a small number of &#147;made available to trade&#148; products, and a wide range of other rules
relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized. BGC Derivative Markets has been active across the full range of Required and Permitted Products executed by U.S.-based customers, and we anticipate improved
derivatives volumes once the international regulatory landscape becomes clearer for the majority of our clients that operate globally. In addition, BGC maintains its ownership stake in ELX, a CFTC-approved designated contract market
(&#147;DCM&#148;), which offers Dodd-Frank Act compliant swap trading to eligible market participants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our relative competitive position
is strong in this new environment, and that we will gain market share in the U.S. This is because the new rules not only require OTC market execution venues to maintain robust front-end and back-office IT capabilities and to make large and ongoing
technology investments, but also because recent revisions to the execution methodology rules will allow elements of voice brokerage to flourish. We are a leader in both the breadth and scale of our hybrid and fully electronic trading capability, and
we expect to outperform our competitors in such an environment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>U.K. and European Regulation </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Financial Conduct Authority (&#147;FCA&#148;) is the main statutory regulator for the United Kingdom financial services industry. The FCA was established
in 2013, and superseded the former regulatory agency, the Financial Services Authority (&#147;FSA&#148;). The FCA&#146;s objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote competition between
financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FCA has continued to implement the far-reaching reform rules initiated by the FSA, that are designed to enhance firms&#146; liquidity risk management
practices, based on the lessons learned since the start of the credit crisis in 2007, as well as a regulatory model with a clear internal separation of conduct of business and prudential regulation. Implications of these rules include better
liquidity risk management capability (including the use of stress testing and contingency funding plans (&#147;CFP&#148;)), less reliance on short-term wholesale funding, and higher amounts and quality of liquid asset securities (government
securities), leading to an increased likelihood of surviving a severe liquidity stress event with the overarching principles being self-sufficiency and adequacy of liquid resources. Currently, we have subsidiaries and branches regulated by the FCA
(BGC Brokers L.P., and the U.K. branch of Aurel BGC). </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From time to time, we have been and are subject to periodic examinations, inspections and investigations,
including periodic risk assessment and related reviews of our U.K. group, the most recent of which took place in 2012. Throughout 2011 and 2012, and following a periodic risk assessment review by the FSA, BGC European Holdings, L.P., and its
regulated subsidiary, BGC Brokers L.P., embarked on a major review of its liquidity and capital and control environment pursuant to which we assessed the appropriateness of the scope and structure of the businesses in our U.K. group. We increased
the liquidity and capital levels of certain of our U.K. group&#146;s regulated businesses, and also reviewed and enhanced our policies and procedures relating to assessing risks and our liquidity and capital requirements. We also produced detailed
contingency planning steps to determine the standalone viability of each of the businesses in our U.K. group as well as a theoretical orderly wind-down scenario for these businesses. Currently, at the request of the FCA, the U.K. group is continuing
to enhance and embed certain aspects of its financial crime prevention framework, its operational risk framework, and its governance structures. The FCA conducted a deep-dive review of the U.K. group between September and October 2014 and issued its
findings letter in December 2014. The letter summarized areas of improvement required but did not include a Skilled Person&#146;s report or Risk Mitigation Program. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;19, 2014, we announced that we had resolved matters with the FCA regarding our acquisition of a stake in GFI Group exceeding 10% without
first informing and seeking the approval of the FCA in breach of certain U.K. controller requirements. This was a breach of U.K. regulatory law. We are working with the FCA to ensure that changes are made to our systems and controls. The FCA had
taken the view that it was not appropriate in this specific case for it to take any formal action. On November&nbsp;19, 2014, we also announced that we had received approval from the FCA to acquire control of GFI and thereby take control of the U.K.
regulated firms within GFI. We have also received similar approvals in Hong Kong and Singapore. See &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Recent European Regulatory Developments </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
European Market Infrastructure Regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (&#147;EMIR&#148;) was adopted in July 2012. EMIR fulfills several of the EU&#146;s G20 commitments to reform OTC derivatives markets. The
reforms reduce systemic risk and bring more transparency to both OTC and listed derivatives markets. EMIR derivatives rules will apply initially to financial and non-financial firms that are counterparties to derivatives contracts in the EU and
later to those trading outside the EU under certain circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first compliance obligations for EMIR came into force in mid-March 2013 with the
adoption of the regulatory technical standards and implementing technical standards which included timely confirmations. Risk mitigation techniques for uncleared OTC derivatives became effective September&nbsp;15, 2013 and comprised ISDA portfolio
reconciliation, dispute resolution and disclosure protocol. The trade reporting for OTC derivative contracts to be reported to a Trade Repository (&#147;TR&#148;) came into effect in phases during February to August 2014. By February 2017, all OTC
derivative contracts entered into before or after August&nbsp;16, 2012 and no longer outstanding as of February&nbsp;12, 2014 are to be reported to a TR. In October 2014, the European Commission adopted its first &#147;equivalence&#148; decisions
for the regulatory regimes of central counterparties in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. The central counterparties in these third country jurisdictions will be able to obtain recognition in the EU and can therefore be used by market
participants to clear standardized OTC derivatives as required by EU legislation, while remaining subject solely to the regulation and supervision of their home jurisdiction. At the same time, the European Securities and Markets Authority
(&#147;ESMA&#148;) published a consultation paper for comment on the draft technical standards on clearing obligations. We expect that variation requirements for non-centrally cleared trades will apply in December 2015. In July 2013, the European
Commission and the CFTC announced the &#147;Path Forward&#148; on the alignment of OTC derivatives regulations between the two jurisdictions. For the EU, this involves the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and proposed
amendments to the European Commission&#146;s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#147;MiFID&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Along with the implementation of EMIR
reporting requirements, the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Markets Integrity and Transparency (&#147;REMIT&#148;) Implementation Acts entered into force on January&nbsp;7, 2015. The REMIT Implementing Acts developed by the European Commission define
the details of reporting under REMIT, drawing up the list of reportable contracts and derivatives; defining details, timing and form of reporting, and establishing harmonized rules to report that information to ACER. They enable ACER to collect
information in relation to wholesale energy market transactions and fundamentals through the Agency&#146;s REMIT Information System (ARIS), to analyze this data to detect market abuse and to report suspicious events to the competent National
Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), which are responsible for investigating these matters further, and if required, imposing sanctions. Market participants and third parties reporting on their behalf will have to: 1) within nine months, i.e. by
October&nbsp;7 2015, report transactions executed at organized market places and fundamental data from the central information transparency platforms; and 2) within fifteen months, i.e. by April&nbsp;7, 2016, report transactions in the remaining
wholesale energy contracts (OTC standard and non-standard supply contracts, transportation contracts) and additional fundamental data. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To achieve a high level of harmonization and strong convergence in regular supervisory reporting requirements,
the Committee of European Banking Supervisors issued guidelines on prudential reporting with the aim of developing a supervisory reporting framework based on common formats, known as COREP. COREP has become part of European Banking Authorities&#146;
implementing technical standards on reporting. In addition, guidelines on Financial Reporting covering consolidated and sub-consolidated financial reporting for supervisory purposes based on International Financial Reporting Standards are being
developed, known as FINREP. These initiatives will impact the nature, timing and extent of regulatory reporting for our European regulated group. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Basel
III (or the Third Basel Accord) is a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk agreed upon by the members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2010 and 2011, and scheduled to be
introduced by bank regulators in most, if not all, of the world&#146;s major economies between 2013 and 2019. Basel III is designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank
leverage. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to raise additional capital and liquidity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The EU is currently in the process of revising the European Commission&#146;s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (&#147;MiFID II&#148;) and the
Market Abuse Directive. Both of these directives are relevant to us, and MiFID II will have a particularly significant impact in a number of areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, pre - and post-trade transparency and investor
protection. MiFID II will also introduce a new catch-all trading venue category known as the organized trading facility, as well as an equivalence assessment of non-EU jurisdictions for granting access to EU markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Much of our global derivatives volumes continue to be executed by non-U.S.-based clients outside the U.S. and subject to local prudential regulations. As
such, we also, continue to operate our Multilateral Trading facility (&#147;MTF&#148;) in accordance with EU directives as licensed by the FCA. The MiFID II draft regulatory technical standards were published by the ESMA on May&nbsp;22, 2014 and
were subject to public comment until August&nbsp;1, 2014. In December 2014, ESMA published a consultation paper on the draft regulatory technical standards in relation to MiFID II and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. The consultation
period ends on March&nbsp;2, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are unable to predict how any of these new laws and proposed rules and regulations will be implemented or in what
form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or rules and regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, subject
us to the risk of fines, sanctions, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements and additional restrictions or limitations on our ability to conduct or grow our businesses, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our
businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form such new rules and regulations might take may negatively impact our customers and trading volumes in certain
markets in which we transact. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. While the broad framework of proposed rules and regulations is known, we believe that it is too early for there to be clarity on the specific
aspects of the proposals that may directly affect our businesses, and those of our customers and markets, as exact rules and regulations have not yet been finalized. While we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations may be
positive for our businesses, unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. </P>

clients, among other business lines, also require that we comply with regulations affecting the real estate industry and maintain licenses in various jurisdictions in which we operate. As the size and scope of real estate sales transactions have

criminal action should we conduct regulated activities without a license, or without maintaining the necessary license or if we violate applicable rules and regulations. Licensing requirements could also impact our ability to engage in certain types
of transactions, change the way in which we conduct business or affect the cost of conducting business. We and our licensed associates may be subject to various due diligence, disclosure, standard-of-care, anti-money laundering and other
obligations.&nbsp;We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales or other services claiming that we did not fulfill our obligations as a service provider or broker. This could include claims with respect to alleged conflicts
of interest where we act, or are perceived to be acting, for two or more clients. While management has overseen highly regulated businesses before and expects us to comply with all applicable regulations in a satisfactory manner, no assurance can be
given that it will always be the case. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, federal, state and local laws and regulations impose various environmental zoning restrictions, use
controls, and disclosure obligations that impact the management, development, use and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities, as well as mortgage lending availability, with respect to such
properties. In our role as property or facilities manager, we could incur liability under environmental laws for the investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes at properties we currently or formerly managed, or at
off-site locations where wastes from such properties were disposed. Such liability can be imposed without regard for the lawfulness of the original disposal activity, or our knowledge of, or fault for, the release or contamination. Further,
liability under some of these may be joint and several, meaning that one liable party could be responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site. We could also be subject to property damage or personal injury claims alleged to result from
environmental contamination, or from asbestos-containing materials or lead-based paint present at the properties or facilities we manage. Certain requirements governing the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing materials, as well as
recently enacted local ordinances obligating property or facilities managers to inspect for and remove lead-based paint in certain buildings, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and potentially subject us to violations or claims. </P>

and Mint Brokers (&#147;MINT&#148;), are also subject to CFTC capital requirements. These requirements are designed to ensure financial soundness and liquidity by prohibiting a broker or dealer from engaging in business at a time when it does not
satisfy minimum net capital requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States, net capital is essentially defined as net worth (assets minus liabilities), plus
qualifying subordinated borrowings and less certain mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from conservatively valuing certain other assets, such as a firm&#146;s positions in
securities. Among these deductions are adjustments, commonly referred to as &#147;haircuts,&#148; to the market value of securities positions to reflect the market risk of such positions prior to their liquidation or disposition. The Uniform Net
Capital Requirements also impose a minimum ratio of debt to equity, which may include qualified subordinated borrowings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulations have been adopted by
the SEC that prohibit the withdrawal of equity capital of a broker-dealer, restrict the ability of a broker-dealer to distribute or engage in any transaction with a parent company or an affiliate that results in a reduction of equity capital or to

expose its customers or creditors to loss. Notice is required following any such withdrawal, distribution, reduction, loan or advance that exceeds, in the aggregate, 20% of excess net capital within any 30 day period. The SEC&#146;s regulations

and MINT, are registered with the SEC and are subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements. As FCMs, BGCF and MINT are also subject to the CFTC minimum capital requirement. BGCF is also a member of the FICC, which imposes capital requirements on
its members. In addition, our SEF, BGC Derivative Markets, is required to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year, keeping at least enough cash or highly liquid securities to cover six months&#146;
operating costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Compliance with the Uniform Net Capital Requirements may limit the extent and nature of our operations requiring the use of our

subject to capital requirements in their local jurisdictions. BGC&nbsp;Brokers L.P. and BGC European Holdings, L.P., which are partnerships based in the United Kingdom, are subject to capital requirements established by the FCA. The FCA applies
stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of these brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of their activities. The provisions relating to capital and liquidity requirements enforced by the FCA
have undergone significant changes in response to the current regulatory landscape, and our U.K. businesses are now required to maintain significantly higher regulatory capital than they have in the past. </P>

business. Additionally, certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain non-U.S. net capital requirements. In Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC and BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited are regulated by the Securities
and Futures Commission and The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, respectively. Both are subject to Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC, BGC France Holdings, and Ginalfi Finance; in Australia, BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited and

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a holding company, and our business is operated through two operating partnerships, BGC U.S., which holds our U.S. businesses, and BGC Global, which
holds our non-U.S. businesses. The limited partnership interests of the two operating partnerships are held by us and BGC Holdings, and the limited partnership interests of BGC Holdings are currently held by limited partnership unit holders,
founding partners, and Cantor. We hold the BGC Holdings general partnership interest and the BGC Holdings special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle us to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC Holdings, and serve as the
general partner of BGC Holdings, which entitles us to control BGC Holdings. BGC Holdings, in turn, holds the BGC U.S. general partnership interest and the BGC U.S. special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to
remove and appoint the general partner of BGC U.S., and the BGC Global general partnership interest and the BGC Global special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle the holder thereof to remove and appoint the general partner of BGC
Global, and serves as the general partner of BGC U.S. and BGC Global, all of which entitle BGC Holdings (and thereby us) to control each of BGC U.S. and BGC Global. BGC Holdings holds its BGC Global general partnership interest through a company
incorporated in the Cayman Islands, BGC Global Holdings GP Limited. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we held directly and indirectly, through wholly owned
subsidiaries, BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests consisting of 219,956,423 units and 219,956,423 units, representing approximately 66.8% and 66.8% of the outstanding BGC U.S. limited partnership
interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, respectively. As of that date, BGC Holdings held BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests consisting of 109,267,301 units and 109,267,301 units,
representing approximately 33.2% and 33.2% of the outstanding BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor directly hold BGC Holdings limited partnership interests. Since BGC Holdings in turn holds BGC
U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership interests, limited partnership unit holders, founding partners, and Cantor indirectly have interests in BGC U.S. limited partnership interests and BGC Global limited partnership
interests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, excluding Preferred Units and NPSUs described below, outstanding BGC Holdings partnership interests included
43,574,077 limited partnership units, 16,910,291 founding partner units and 48,782,933 Cantor units. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may in the future effect additional redemptions
of BGC Holdings limited partnership units and founding partner units for shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. We may also continue our earlier partnership restructuring programs, whereby we redeemed or repurchased certain limited partnership
units and founding partner units in exchange for new units, grants of exchangeability for Class&nbsp;A common stock or cash and, in many cases, obtained modifications or extensions of partners&#146; employment arrangements. We also generally expect
to continue to grant exchange rights with respect to outstanding non-exchangeable limited partnership units and founding partner units, and to repurchase BGC Holdings partnership interests from time to time, including from Cantor, our executive
officers, and other employees and partners, unrelated to our partnership restructuring programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cantor units are generally exchangeable with us for our
Class B common stock (or, at Cantor&#146;s option or if there are no additional authorized but unissued shares of our Class B common stock, our Class&nbsp;A common stock) on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). Upon
certain circumstances, Cantor may have the right to acquire additional Cantor units in connection with the redemption of or grant of exchangeability to certain non-exchangeable founding partner units, none of which was redeemed/exchanged in the
Global Partnership Restructuring Program. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, there were 732,226 non-exchangeable founding partner units with respect to which Cantor had the right to acquire an equivalent number of Cantor units. </P>

creates new preferred partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;), which are working partner units that may be awarded to holders of, or contemporaneous with the grant of, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs,&nbsp;APSIs, APSEs, REUs, RPUs, AREUs, and
ARPUs. These new Preferred Units carry the same name as the underlying unit, with the insertion of an additional &#147;P&#148; to designate them as Preferred Units. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Such Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class&nbsp;A common stock and accordingly will not be included in the fully diluted share count.
Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings will be allocated to such Units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) of the allocation amount assigned to them based on their award price, or such other amount as set forth
in the award documentation (the &#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;), before calculation and distribution of the quarterly Partnership distribution for the remaining Partnership units. The Preferred Units will not be entitled to participate in
Partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 there were 8,685,078 such units granted and outstanding. The Ninth Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
and by the full Board. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;9, 2014, partners of BGC Holdings approved the Tenth Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of BGC Holdings

fluctuations in volume and commissions on securities transactions, the absolute and relative level of currency rates, commercial real estate values and the volume of real estate transactions, and the actual and the perceived quality of issuers,
borrowers and investors. For example, the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and international central banking authorities directly impact our cost of funds and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, changes in monetary
policy may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult to predict. </P>

such operations are less diversified and, accordingly, are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors. If we are unable to identify and successfully manage or mitigate these risks, our businesses, financial condition,

salespeople, managers, or other professionals or successfully enter new markets. In addition, we may be prevented or limited from hiring new brokers, salespeople, managers or other front office professionals for some period by contract, such as our

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit our number of acquisitions and growth opportunities and may lead to higher
acquisition prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial costs, delays or other operational, regulatory
or financial difficulties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in the U.K. we previously agreed to a voluntary limitation, which ended on March&nbsp;1, 2012, on closing
acquisitions of new businesses regulated by the FCA, formerly the FSA, or entering into new regulated business lines, which had a temporary adverse impact on our ability to add financial services business to our U.K. group. While the FCA released us
from this voluntary limitation, no assurance can be given that the FCA or any other regulatory body would not institute a similar limitation in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In both of our business segments, any future growth will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at
favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions, including the acquisition of GFI. Future acquisitions and any necessary related
financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which include payment of break-up fees, assumption of liabilities, including compensation, severance and lease termination costs, and transaction and deferred financing costs,
among others. In addition, there can be no assurance that such acquisitions will be accretive or generate favorable operating margins. The success of these acquisitions will also be determined in part by the ongoing performance of the acquired
companies and the acceptance of acquired employees of our partnership compensation structure and other variables which may be different from the existing industry standards or practices at the acquired companies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Management will need to successfully manage the integration of recent acquisitions and future growth effectively. The integration and additional growth may
place a significant strain upon our management, administrative, operational, compliance, and financial infrastructure. Our ability to grow depends upon our ability to successfully hire, train, supervise and manage additional employees, expand our
operational, compliance, financial reporting, and other control systems effectively, allocate our human resources optimally, maintain clear lines of communication between our transactional and management functions and our finance and accounting
functions, and manage the pressure on our management, administrative, operational, compliance, and financial infrastructure. Additionally, managing future growth may be difficult due to our new geographic locations and business lines. As a result of
these risks and challenges, we may not realize the full benefits that we anticipate from strategic alliances, acquisitions, joint ventures or new hires. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate and respond to the
changing demands we will face as we integrate and continue to expand our operations, and we may not be able to manage growth effectively or to achieve growth at all. Any failure to manage the integration of acquisitions and future growth effectively
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Liquidity, Funding and Indebtedness

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a parent holding company with no direct operations. We conduct substantially all of our operations through
our operating subsidiaries. We do not have any material assets other than our direct and indirect ownership in the equity of our operating subsidiaries. As a result, our operating cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries. In
addition, we are dependent on the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to any of our subsidiaries, we,
as an equity owner of such subsidiary, and therefore holders of our securities, including our notes, will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary&#146;s creditors, including trade creditors, and any preferred equity holders. Any dividends
declared by us, any payment by us of our indebtedness or other expenses, and all applicable taxes payable in respect of our net taxable income, if any, are paid from cash on hand and funds received from distributions, loans or other payments from
BGC U.S. and BGC Global. Regulatory, tax restrictions or elections, and other legal or contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely from our subsidiaries. In particular, many of our subsidiaries, including our
broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws, regulations, and self-regulatory organization rules that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to a parent holding company, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in
certain circumstances. These laws, regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to meet our obligations. Certain debt and security agreements entered into by our subsidiaries contain various restrictions, including
restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us and the transfer by our subsidiaries of assets pledged as collateral. To the extent that we need funds to pay dividends, repay indebtedness and meet other expenses, or to pay taxes on our share of
BGC U.S.&#146;s and BGC Global&#146;s net taxable income, and either BGC U.S. or BGC Global or their respective subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law, regulations, or agreements, or are otherwise unable to
provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including our ability to raise additional funding, including through access to the debt and equity capital markets.

in the past been and could in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the U.S. and international economy and markets, with the cost and availability of funding adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. To the
extent we are not able to access the debt capital markets on acceptable terms in the future, we may seek to raise funding and capital through equity issuances or other means. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Future turbulence in the U.S. and international economy and markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain
customers and counterparties to do business with each other or with us. Acquisitions and financial reporting obligations related thereto may impact our ability to access capital markets on a timely basis and may necessitate greater short-term
borrowing in the interim, which in turn may adversely affect the interest rates on our debt and our credit ratings and associated outlooks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our funding
base consists of longer-term capital (equity, notes payable and collateralized borrowings), shorter-term liabilities and accruals that are a natural outgrowth of specific assets and/or our Financial Services business model, such as matched fails and
accrued compensation. We generally have had limited need for short-term unsecured funding in our Financial Services segment. We may, however, need to access short-term capital sources to meet business needs from time to time, including, but not
limited to, financing acquisitions, conducting operations, hiring or retaining brokers, providing liquidity and funding fails, including in situations where we may not be able to access the capital markets in a timely manner when desired by us.
Contingent liquidity needs are largely limited to potential cash collateral that may be needed to meet clearing bank, clearinghouse and exchange margins and/or to fund fails. A significant portion of our cash is held in our largest regulated
entities, and we believe that cash in and available to these entities, inclusive of financing provided by clearing banks, is adequate for potential cash demands of normal operations such as margin or funding fails. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or may be prevented from using intellectual property necessary for our businesses. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our success is dependent, in part, upon our intellectual property, including our proprietary technology. We generally rely primarily on trade secret,
contract, patent, copyright, and trademark law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights to proprietary technologies, products,
services or methods, and our brand. For example, we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development, and we are currently pursuing patent applications around the world. We also control access to our
proprietary technology, and enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technologies without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights
despite our precautions. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. We cannot ensure that our intellectual property rights are sufficient to protect our competitive
advantages or that any particular patent, copyright, or trademark is valid and enforceable, and all patents ultimately expire. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the
laws in the U.S., or at all. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our businesses or our ability to compete. For example, reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could
adversely affect our revenues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Many companies, including those in the computer
and financial services industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and sometimes file lawsuits based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, over the past years there
has been a proliferation of patents applicable to these industries and a substantial increase in the number of such patent applications filed. Under current law, U.S. patent applications typically remain secret for 18 months or, in some cases, until
a patent is issued. Because of technological changes in these industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of our products and services may unknowingly infringe
existing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Although we have taken steps to protect ourselves, there can be no assurance that we will be aware of all patents, copyrights or trademarks that may pose a risk of infringement by our
products and services. Generally, it is not economically practicable to determine in advance whether our products or services may infringe the present or future rights of others. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Accordingly, we may face claims of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights that could interfere with our ability to use intellectual
property or technology that is material to our businesses. In addition, restrictions on the distribution of some of the market data generated by our brokerage desks could limit the comprehensiveness and quality of the data we are able to distribute
or sell. The number of such third-party claims may grow. Our technologies may not be able to withstand such third-party claims or rights against their use. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the future, we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of
the rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such claims or litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in </P>

substantial costs, the diversion of resources, and the attention of management, any of which could negatively affect our businesses. Responding to these claims could also require us to enter into
royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement, stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages on our own behalf or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Such royalty or
licensing agreements, if available, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, and may cause our operating margins to decline. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>If our software

our obligations under the license agreements. If any material licenses were terminated or adversely changed or amended, or if any of these third parties were to cease doing business, we may be forced to spend significant time and money to replace
the licensed software and databases, and our ability to operate our businesses may be materially adversely affected. Although we take steps to locate replacements, there can be no assurance that the necessary replacements will be available on
reasonable terms, if at all. There can be no assurance that we will have an ongoing license to use all intellectual property which our systems require, the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>IT Systems and Cybersecurity Risks </B></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If we experience computer systems failures or capacity constraints, our ability to conduct our business operations could be harmed. We support and maintain
many of our computer systems and networks internally. Our failure to monitor or maintain these systems and networks or, if necessary, to find a replacement for this technology in a timely and cost-effective manner would have a material adverse
effect on our ability to conduct our business operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although all of our business critical systems have been designed and implemented with fault
tolerant and/or redundant clustered hardware and diversely routed network connectivity, our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate. Although we operate four geographically disparate main data centers, they could be
subject to failure due to environmental factors, power outage and other factors. Additionally, the Rochelle Park, NJ data center was transferred to NASDAQ OMX in June 2013. We continue to use that data center and have the right to do so until June
2015, after which time we plan to relocate this data center to a co-location facility in New Jersey. We may be subject to system failures and outages which might impact our revenues and relationships with customers. In addition, we will be subject
to risk in the event that systems of our customers, business partners, counterparties, vendors, and other third parties, including exchanges and clearing organizations, are subject to failures and outages. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We rely on various third parties for computer and communications systems, such as telephone companies, online service providers, data processors, and software

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our businesses require us to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and
diverse markets in many currencies. Developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. Our financial,
accounting, data processing or other operating and compliance systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a malicious cyber attack or other
adverse events, which may adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide services. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, our operations rely on the secure
processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures such as software programs, firewalls and similar technology to maintain the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of our and our customers&#146; information, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of cyber threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and
networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability or disruption of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code,
cyber attack and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we have taken, these threats may come from external factors such as governments, organized crime, hackers, and other third parties such
as outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within us. Given the high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business
activities, including customers, counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of a cyber attack on or breach of our operational systems, data or infrastructure.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There have been an increasing number of cyber attacks in recent years in various industries, including ours. If one or more of these cyber attacks
occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our
customers&#146; or other third parties&#146;, operations, which could result in reputational damage, financial losses, regulatory penalties and/or customer dissatisfaction or loss, which may not in all cases by covered by insurance. Any such cyber
incidents involving our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties important to our businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our financial services regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on matters relating to cybersecurity threats,
including the assessment of firms&#146; vulnerability to cyber attacks. In particular, regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cybersecurity governance and risk management policies, practices and procedures;
protecting firm networks and information; identifying and addressing risk associated with remote access to client information and fund transfer requests; identifying and addressing risks associated with customers business partners, counterparties,
vendors, and other third parties, including exchanges and clearing organizations; preventing and detecting unauthorized activities; adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to address the impact of cybersecurity breaches; and
establishing protocols for reporting cybersecurity incidents. While any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cybersecurity incident may help to prevent our realizing a significant loss from the incident, it would not protect us from the
effects of adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cybersecurity controls, including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions. </P>

and other disruptions. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may encounter disruptions involving power, communications, transportation or other utilities or essential services depended
on by us or by third parties with whom we conduct business, such as was the case with Hurricane Sandy in 2012. This could include disruptions as the result of natural disasters, pandemics, or weather-related or similar events, such as fires,
hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, political instability, labor strikes or turmoil or terrorist attacks. These disruptions may occur, for example, as a result of events affecting only the buildings in which we operate (such as fires), or as a
result of events with a broader impact on the communities where those buildings are located. If a disruption occurs in one location and persons in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to or work from other locations, our ability to
service and interact with our customers and others may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communications or travel. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Such events can result in significant injuries and loss of life, which could result in material financial liabilities, loss of business and reputational harm.
They can also impact the availability and/or loss of commercial insurance policies, both for our own businesses and for those customers whose properties we manage and who may purchase their insurance through the insurance buying programs we make
available to them. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There can be no assurance that the disaster recovery and crisis management procedures we employ will suffice in any particular
situation to avoid a significant loss. Given that our employees are increasingly mobile and less reliant on physical presence in our offices, our disaster recovery plans increasingly rely on the availability of the Internet (including
&#147;cloud&#148; technology) and mobile phone technology, so the disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation. Although we maintain insurance for liability, property damage and business
interruption, subject to deductibles and various exceptions, no assurance can be given that our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will not be negatively affected by such events in the future. </P>

where we manage properties for clients in our Real Estate business, and we may face liability with respect to environmental issues occurring at properties that we manage or occupy</B>. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Various laws and regulations restrict the levels of certain substances that may be discharged into the environment by properties and they may impose liability
on current or previous real estate owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at the property. We may face costs or liabilities under these laws as a result of our
role as an on-site property manager. Within our own operation, we face additional costs from rising costs which make it more expensive to operate our corporate offices. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our own operations are generally conducted within leased office building space and, accordingly, we do not currently anticipate that regulations restricting
the emissions of greenhouse gases, or taxes that may be imposed on their release, would result in material costs or capital expenditures. However, we cannot be certain about the extent to which such regulations will develop as there are higher
levels of understanding and commitments by different governments around the world regarding risks related to the climate and how they should be mitigated. Regulations relating to climate change may affect the scope of services we provide to clients
in their managed properties, but we expect that clients would typically bear any additional costs of doing so under applicable management agreements. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate that the potential effects of climate change may impact the decisions and analysis the employees in
our Real Estate businesses make with respect to the properties they evaluate or manage on behalf of clients since climate change considerations may impact the relative desirability of locations and the cost of operating and insuring the properties.
Future legislation that requires specific performance levels for building operations could make non-compliant buildings more expensive, which could materially affect investments in properties we have made on behalf of clients. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also anticipate that the potential effects of climate change may impact our own operations and those of client properties we manage, especially when they
are located in coastal cities. For example, during 2012 our own operations and properties we manage for clients in the northeastern United States, and in particular New York City, were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, in some cases significantly. </P>

is also the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cantor and President of CFGM, the managing partner of Cantor. Stephen M. Merkel, who serves as our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, is employed as
Executive Managing Director, General Counsel and Secretary of Cantor. In addition, Messrs. Lutnick and Merkel also hold offices at various other affiliates of Cantor. These two key employees are not subject to employment agreements with us or any of
our subsidiaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Currently, Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick and Mr.&nbsp;Merkel each spend approximately 50% of their time on our matters, although these percentages
may vary depending on business developments at us or Cantor or any of our or Cantor&#146;s affiliates. As a result, these key employees (and others in key executive or management roles whom we may hire from time to time) dedicate only a portion of
their professional efforts to our businesses and operations, and there is no contractual obligation for them to spend a specific amount of their time with us and/or Cantor. These two key employees may not be able to dedicate adequate time to our
businesses and operations, and we could experience an adverse effect on our operations due to the demands placed on our management team by their other professional obligations. In addition, these key employees&#146; other responsibilities could
cause conflicts of interest with us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement, which includes non-competition and other arrangements applicable to
our key employees who are limited partners of BGC Holdings, may not prevent our key employees, including Messrs. Lutnick and Merkel, whose employment by Cantor is not subject to these provisions in the BGC Holdings limited partnership agreement,
from resigning or competing against us. In addition, our success in the Financial Services segment has largely been dependent on the efforts of Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick and our President, Shaun Lynn, and other executive officers, including our Chief
Financial Officer, A. Graham Sadler, who has recently announced his retirement. In the Real Estate Services segment, our success has similarly been dependent on efforts by Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick in connection with acquisitions and on an ongoing basis by
officers and other key employees, including some who have been hired in connection with these acquisitions. Should Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick leave or otherwise become unavailable to render services to us, control of us would likely pass to Cantor, and
indirectly pass to the then-controlling stockholder of CFGM (which is Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick), Cantor&#146;s managing general partner, or to such other managing general partner as CFGM would appoint, and as a result control could remain with
Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick. If any of our key employees in our Financial Services or Real Estate Services segments were to join an existing competitor, form a competing company, offer services to Cantor that compete with our services or otherwise leave us,
some of our customers could choose to use the services of that competitor or another competitor instead of our services, which could adversely affect our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects. </P>

restate our financial statements, and we may be delayed or prevented from accessing the capital markets. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are subject to the requirements of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the applicable SEC rules and regulations that require an annual management report on our internal controls over financial reporting and an attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm on our
internal controls. The management report includes, among other matters, management&#146;s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal controls over financial reporting
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements<I>.</I> Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal controls. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As such, we could lose investor confidence in
the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which may have a material adverse effect on our stock price. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to identify and
remediate any material weaknesses in our internal controls could affect our ability to prepare financial reports in a timely manner, control our policies, procedures, operations, and assets, assess and manage our operational, regulatory, and
financial risks, and integrate our acquired businesses. Similarly, we need to effectively manage any growth that we achieve in such a way as to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable internal control, financial reporting, and legal and
regulatory requirements. Any failures to ensure full compliance with internal control and financial reporting requirements could result in restatement, delay or prevent us from accessing the capital markets, and harm our reputation and the market
price for our Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Ongoing compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as compliance with current and future regulatory control
requirements, including those imposed or expected to be imposed by the FCA, may require significant expenses and divert management resources from our operations and could require a restructuring of our internal controls over financial reporting. Any
such expenses, time reallocations, or restructuring could be disruptive and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Traditionally, the financial markets around the world experience lower volume during the summer and at the end of the year due to a general slowdown in the

could have a material effect on our results of operations in any given period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The seasonality of our businesses makes it difficult to determine during
the course of the year whether planned results will be achieved, and thus to adjust to changes in expectations. To the extent that we are not able to identify and adjust for changes in expectations or we are confronted with negative conditions that
inordinately impact seasonal norms, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>RISKS
RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>General Financial Services Market Conditions </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Consolidation and concentration of market share in the banking, brokerage, exchange and financial services industries could materially adversely affect our
businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects because we may not be able to compete successfully. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, there has
been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the banking, brokerage, exchange and financial services industries, resulting in increasingly large existing and potential competitors, and increased concentration in markets
dominated by some of our largest customers. In addition, some of our large broker-dealer customers, such as UBS, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley have announced plans to reduce their sales and trading businesses in fixed
income, currency, and commodities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The combination of this consolidation and the reduction by large customers of certain businesses may lead to increased
concentration among our broker-dealer customers, which may reduce our ability to negotiate pricing and other matters with our customers and lower volumes. Additionally, the sales and trading global revenue market share has become increasingly
concentrated over the past five years among five of the top investment banks across equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities asset classes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
also face existing and potential competition from large exchanges, which seek or may seek to migrate trading from the inter-dealer market to their own. Consolidation is occurring in this area as well. Recently, BATS Global Markets acquired the
foreign-exchange trading venue, Hotspot from KCG Holdings, while the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited acquired the London Metal Exchange while ICE completed the acquisition of NYSE Euronext. Consolidation among exchanges may increase their
financial resources and ability to compete with us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Continued consolidation and reduction in the financial services industry and especially among our
customers could lead to the exertion of additional pricing pressure by our customers, impacting the commissions and spreads we generate from our brokerage services. Further, the recent consolidation among exchanges, and expansion by these exchanges
into derivative and other non-equity trading markets, will increase competition for customer trades and place additional pricing pressure on commissions and spreads. These developments have increased competition from firms with potentially greater
access to capital resources than we have. Finally, consolidation among our competitors other than exchange firms could result in increased resources and product or service offerings for our competitors. If we are not able to compete successfully in
the future, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Actions taken by central
banks in major global economies may have a negative impact on our businesses. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, policies undertaken by certain central banks, such as
the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England, have involved quantitative easing or the buying and selling of currencies in the foreign exchange market. Quantitative easing involves open market transactions by monetary
authorities to stimulate economic activity through the purchase of assets of longer maturity and has the effect of lowering interest rates further out on the yield curve. </P>

<h5 align="left"><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For example, as of January&nbsp;1, 2015, the U.S. Federal Reserve held approximately $4.5 trillion worth of
long-dated U.S. Treasury and Federal Agency securities which are not being traded or hedged. This compares to $1.7 trillion at the beginning of 2011 and zero prior to September 2008. This has reduced volatility and volumes for listed and OTC
interest rate products in the U.S. Although the Federal Reserve ceased repurchases, it continues to hold substantially all of the securities purchased. In addition, the Federal Reserve may continue to use traditional methods to keep short-term
interest rates low by historical standards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Recently, central banks in other jurisdictions, including the EU, Japan and China, have undertaken
quantitative easing and other steps aimed at stimulating their economies through monetary policy. In these jurisdictions also, interest rates are expected to remain low by historical standards for some time to come. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, global FX volumes were muted in 2012 and 2013, largely because certain major central banks, such as those in Japan and, until recently,
Switzerland, intervened to keep global currencies from appreciating, and because low interest rates (themselves partially a result of quantitative easing) in most major economies make carry-trade strategies less appealing for FX market participants.
In addition, increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions are likely to result in increased holdings of government securities, which holdings will be less likely to be traded or hedged, thus reducing further transaction
volumes in those securities. Since the new capital requirements make it more expensive for the banks and other financial institutions to hold assets other than government securities, the new requirements may also reduce their trading and hedging
activities in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. These central banking policies may adversely affect our businesses, particularly our rates and FX operations. In
addition, many of our large bank customers have faced increasing regulatory scrutiny of their rates and FX businesses, and this may negatively impact industry volumes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The migration of OTC swaps to SEF markets may impact volumes, liquidity and demand for our services in certain markets. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Derivative Markets, our subsidiary, began operating as a SEF on October&nbsp;2, 2013. After this date, all eligible derivatives traded by US Persons
required SEF registration. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants commenced in February 2014. The full Dodd-Frank Act rule set regarding execution, clearing and reporting requirements has
been finalized more slowly than anticipated and has been effected through no action letters, temporary relief, guidance and multiple interpretations. As a result, many of our largest customers have reduced their trading exposures until the rule
consequences are completely known. In addition, we maintain our ownership stake in ELX, a CFTC-approved DCM. Although we believe that our SEF and ELX are in compliance with applicable rules, no assurance can be given that the market for these
products will not be less robust, that there may be less volume and liquidity in these markets, that there may be less demand for our services or the market in general or that the industry will not experience disruptions as customers or market
participants transition to the new system. If such events were to occur, our business in these products could be significantly reduced and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. </P>

to our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">commodities-related</FONT> activities, including trading of electricity, natural gas, and environmental interests. New regulation of OTC derivatives markets in the U.S. and similar legislation proposed or
adopted abroad will impose significant new costs and new requirements on the commodities derivatives activities of us and our customers. Therefore, the overall reputation of us or our clients may be adversely affected by the current or future
regulatory environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and fines for market participants. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The commodities-related activities of us and our clients are also subject to the risk of unforeseen catastrophic events, many of which are outside of our
control, which could result in significant liabilities for us or our customers. We may not be able to obtain insurance to cover these risks, and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. The occurrence of any of such
events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with customers, may impair our operations, and may result in litigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm, which could have a negative effect on our

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The financial services industry in which we operate is subject to significant regulation. We are subject to regulatory capital requirements on our regulated
businesses, and a significant operating loss or any extraordinary charge against capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or, depending upon the magnitude of the loss or charge, even to maintain the current level of our businesses.
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many aspects of our businesses, like those of other financial intermediary firms, are subject to significant capital requirements. In the U.S., the
SEC, FINRA and various other regulatory bodies (including the CFTC and the NFA) have stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of the
broker-dealer&#146;s activities. Broker-dealers that also act as FCMs, such as our subsidiaries, BGCF and MINT, are subject to CFTC capital requirements as well. In addition, we hold a 49% limited partnership interest in Aqua, a U.S. registered
broker-dealer. These broker-dealers are subject to SEC, FINRA, CFTC and NFA net capital requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our international operations are also subject to
capital requirements. BGC Brokers L.P. and BGC European Holdings, L.P., which are partnerships based in the U.K., are currently subject to capital requirements established by the FCA, the main statutory regulator for the U.K. financial services
industry. The FCA applies stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of these brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of their activities. The provisions relating to capital and liquidity
requirements enforced by the FCA have undergone significant change, and our U.K. businesses are now required to maintain significantly higher regulatory levels of capital than they have in the past. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do
business. These regulations often include minimum capital requirements, which are subject to change. Similar requirements are applied to certain of our other subsidiaries that are regulated in other countries, such as Australia, France and Hong
Kong. Further, we may become subject to capital requirements in other foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may enter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
expect to continue to maintain levels of capital in excess of regulatory minima. Should we fail to maintain the required capital, we may be required to reduce or suspend our broker-dealer operations during the period that we are not in compliance
with capital requirements, and may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration or withdrawal of authorization or other disciplinary action from domestic and international regulators, which would have a material adverse effect on us. In
addition, should we fail to maintain the capital required by clearing organizations of which we are a member, our ability to clear through those clearing organizations may be impaired, which may adversely affect our ability to process trades. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If the capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against capital, our
operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited. Our ability to withdraw capital from our regulated subsidiaries is subject to restrictions, which, in turn, could limit our ability to pay our indebtedness and other expenses,
dividends on our Class&nbsp;A common stock, and distributions on our BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, and to repurchase shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock or purchase BGC Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity
interests in our subsidiaries, including from Cantor, our executive officers, other employees, partners and others, and pursue strategic acquisitions or other growth opportunities. We cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain
additional financing. No assurance can be given that capital levels will remain stable or that we will not incur substantial expenses in connection with maintaining current or increased capital levels or engaging in business restructurings or other
activities in response to these requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, financial intermediary firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived
conflicts, including for example principal trading and trading to make markets. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, and we will regularly seek to review and update our
policies, controls and procedures. However, these policies, controls and procedures may result in increased costs and additional operational personnel. Failure to adhere to these policies, controls and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions

regulated. Proposals for additional legislation further regulating the financial services industry are periodically introduced in the U.S., the EU and other geographic areas. Moreover, the agencies regulating the financial services industry also
periodically adopt changes to their rules and regulations, particularly as these agencies have increased the focus and intensity of their regulation of the financial services industry. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Changes in legislation and in the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the U.S. Treasury, the FCA, the European Commission, the
European Securities and Market Authority and other domestic and international regulators and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">self-regulatory</FONT> organizations, as well as changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules,
often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers and could result in restrictions in the way we conduct our businesses. For example, the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, SEC and the CFTC are continuing to review the nature and scope of their regulation and oversight of the government securities markets and U.S. markets. The E.U. is currently in the process of revising MiFID II and the Market Abuse Directive.
Both of these directives are relevant to us, and MiFID II will have a particularly significant impact in a number of areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, pre &#150; and post-trade transparency and investor protection. MiFID
II will also introduce a new catch-all trading venue category known as the organized trading facility, as well as an equivalence assessment on non-EU jurisdictions for granting access to EU markets. Therefore, uncertainties resulting from the
possibility of additional legislation and/or regulation, could adversely impact our businesses. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could result in fines, penalties, restrictions or limitations on business activity,
suspension or expulsion from the industry, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, the European Commission and the CFTC
announced the &#147;Path Forward&#148; on the alignment of OTC derivatives regulations between the two jurisdictions. For the EU, this involves the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and proposed amendments to MiFID. The
SEC, the CFTC and the European Commission are still in the process of finalizing rules for the implementation of these requirements. The actual implementation of any such rules may be phased in over a longer period. There can be no guarantee that
the final rules will not negatively impact our volumes or revenues or fundamentally alter the historical relationship between OTC wholesale brokers and our clients, which may have an adverse effect on us. </P>

Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be a continued uncertainty regarding the application of the Volcker Rule, its impact on various affected businesses, how
those businesses will respond to it, and the effect that it will have on the markets in which we do business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other regulatory initiatives include Basel
III (or the Third Basel Accord), a global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk scheduled to be introduced by bank regulators in most, if not all, of the world&#146;s major economies between 2013 and
2019. Basel III is designed to strengthen bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer
customers to raise additional capital and liquidity. As a result, their businesses, results of operations, financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected, which might cause them to do less business. Such potential impact could
adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our Financial Services segment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the U.K., the FCA has continued to implement the far-reaching
reform rules initiated by the FSA that are designed to enhance firms&#146; liquidity risk management practices, based on the lessons learned since the start of the recent credit crisis in 2007, as well as a regulatory model with a clear internal
separation of conduct of business and prudential regulation. Implications of these rules include better liquidity in risk management capability (including the use of stress testing and contingency funding plans), less reliance on short-term
wholesale funding, and higher amounts and quality of liquid asset securities (government securities), leading to an increased likelihood of surviving a severe liquidity stress event, the overarching principles being self-sufficiency and adequacy of
liquid resources. Currently, we have subsidiaries and branches regulated by the FCA (BGC Brokers L.P., and the U.K. branch of Aurel BGC). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Further, the
authorities of certain EU countries may from time to time institute changes to tax law that, if applicable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similarly, the U.S.
has proposed a series of changes to U.S. tax law, some of which could apply to us. It is not possible to predict if any of these new provisions will be enacted or, if they are, what form they may take. It is possible that one or more of such
provisions could negatively impact our costs and our effective tax rate, which would affect our after-tax earnings. If any of such changes to tax law were implemented and/or deemed to apply to us, they could have a material adverse effect on our
businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including on our ability to attract, compensate and retain executives and brokers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form such new laws and regulations might take may negatively impact trading volumes in
certain markets in which we transact. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. While the broad framework of currently proposed laws and regulations is known, we believe that it is too early for there to be clarity on
the specific aspects of the U.S. and EU proposals which may directly impact our businesses as some proposals have not yet been finalized. Additionally, unintended consequences of the laws, rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to
be determined. We are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws, rules or regulations, including the interpretation or
implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P>

other international regulators, require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Firms in the financial services industry, including us, have
experienced increased scrutiny in recent years, and penalties, fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the NFA, state securities commissions and state attorneys general in the U.S., and the FCA
in the U.K. and other international regulators, have increased accordingly. This trend toward a heightened regulatory and enforcement environment can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future, and this environment may create uncertainty.

reviews of our U.K. group, the most recent of which took place in 2012 and a FCA review in 2014 in connection with our offer to acquire GFI. Throughout 2011 and 2012, and following a periodic risk assessment review by the FSA, BGC European Holdings,
L.P., and its regulated subsidiary, BGC Brokers L.P., embarked on a major review of its liquidity and capital, and control environment, pursuant to which we assessed the appropriateness of the scope and structure of the businesses in our U.K. group.
We increased the liquidity and capital levels of certain of our U.K. group&#146;s regulated businesses, and also reviewed and enhanced our policies and procedures relating to assessing risks and our liquidity and capital requirements. We also
produced detailed contingency planning steps to determine the standalone viability of each of the businesses in our U.K. group as well as a theoretical orderly wind-down scenario for these businesses. Currently, at the request of the FCA, the U.K.
group is continuing to enhance and embed certain aspects of its financial crime prevention framework, operational risk framework, and governance structures. The FCA conducted a deep dive review of the U.K. group between September and October 2014
and issued its findings letter in December 2014. The letter summarized areas of improvement required but did not include a Skilled Person&#146;s report or Risk Mitigation Program. </P>

arbitrations and other actions involving primarily claims for damages. Examinations, inspections, regulatory inquiries and subpoenas or other requests for information or testimony may cause us to incur significant expenses, including fees for legal
representation and other professional advisors and costs associated with document production and remediation efforts. Such regulatory or other actions may also be directed at certain executives or employees who may be critical to our businesses or
to particular brokerage desks. The risks associated with such matters often may be difficult to assess or quantify, and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A settlement of, or judgment related to, any such matters could result in civil or criminal liability, penalties, fines, restrictions or limitations on our
operations and activities and other sanctions and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Any such action could also cause us significant reputational harm, which,
in turn, could seriously harm us. In addition, regardless of the outcome of such matters, we may incur significant legal and other costs, including substantial management time, dealing with such matters, even if we are not a party to the litigation
or a target of the inquiry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our Financial Services segment, we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our customers and our reputation for
integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain customers. As a result, if our customers are not satisfied with our services, such dissatisfaction may be more damaging to our Financial Services businesses than to other types
of businesses. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or cause significant reputational damage to us,
which could seriously harm us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, financial intermediary firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interests or perceived conflicts, including
for example principal trading and trading to make markets. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, and we will regularly seek to review and update our policies, controls and

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, we have significantly grown the number of brokers in our businesses through new hires and acquisitions of existing businesses, and we expect
to continue to do so in the future. Competition for the services of brokers is intense, especially for brokers with experience in the specialized businesses in which we participate or we may seek to enter. If we are unable to hire or retain highly
qualified brokers, including retaining those employed by businesses we acquire in the future, we may not be able to enter new brokerage markets or develop new products or services. If we lose one or more of our brokers in a particular market in
which we participate, our revenues may decrease and we may lose market share. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, recruitment and retention of qualified brokers could result in
substantial additional costs. We have been and are currently a party to, or otherwise involved in, several lawsuits and arbitrations involving competitor claims in connection with employee hires and/or departures, including our recently settled

common in the financial services industry due to its highly competitive nature. An adverse settlement or judgment related to these or similar types of claims could have a material adverse effect

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We face strong competition from brokerages, broker-dealers, financial services firms, and exchanges, many of which have greater market presence, marketing

results of operations or prospects. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial services industry is intensely competitive, and is expected to remain so. In our Financial Services
segment, we primarily compete with four major, diversified inter-dealer brokers and financial intermediaries. These inter-dealer brokers are ICAP plc, Tullett Prebon plc, GFI and Compagnie Financi&egrave;re Tradition (which is majority owned by
Viel&nbsp;&amp; Cie), all of which are currently publicly traded companies. On February&nbsp;26, 2015, we completed our tender offer to acquire GFI (See &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148;). Other inter-dealer broker and financial intermediary
competitors include a number of smaller, privately-held firms that tend to specialize in specific products and services or geographic areas. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also
compete with companies that provide alternative products and services, such as contracts traded on futures exchanges, and trading processes, such as the direct dealer-to-dealer market for government securities and stock exchange markets for
corporate equities, debt and other securities. We increasingly compete with exchanges for the execution of trades in certain products, mainly in derivatives such as futures, swaps, options and options on futures. Certain exchanges have made and will
likely continue to make attempts to move certain OTC-traded products to exchange-based execution. We also compete with consortia, such as those operated by Tradeweb, which are created or funded from time to time by banks, broker-dealers and other
companies involved in financial services, such as Thomson Reuters Corporation, to compete in various markets with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers. In addition, financial data and information firms such as Thomson Reuters Corporation and Bloomberg

us, Cantor or another large financial institution could adversely affect us or financial markets generally. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The commercial soundness of many
financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. For example, we rely on Cantor as our clearing agent under the Clearing Agreement for certain securities
transactions, primarily U.S. government securities, while we self-clear certain other products. A default by one of our customers could lead to liquidity concerns in our business and, to the extent that Cantor or another entity that clears for us
has difficulty meeting capital requirements or otherwise meeting its obligations, we may need to provide our own liquidity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, concerns about,
or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as &#147;systemic risk&#148; and may adversely affect financial
intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. Similarly, our vendors, including insurance companies and other
providers, are subject to normal business risks as well as risks related to U.S. and international economic and market conditions. Failure of any of these vendor institutions could also adversely affect us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The credit ratings and associated outlooks of firms in our financial services industries, including us, may be critical to their reputation and operational
and financial success. A firm&#146;s credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity
management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels, the firm&#146;s competitive position in the
industry and its relationship with other firms. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances of that firm or related firms warrant
such a change. Any reduction in credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on acceptable terms, as well as the cost and other terms upon which any such financing can be obtained. In
addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties in certain markets and in certain transactions. Additional collateral may be required in the event of a credit ratings or outlook downgrade. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our financial services activities are subject to credit and performance risks, which could result in us incurring significant losses that could materially
adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our activities are subject to credit and performance
risks. For example, our customers may not deliver securities to one of our operating subsidiaries which has sold those securities to another customer. If the securities due to be delivered have increased in value, there is a risk that we may have to
expend our own funds in connection with the purchase of other securities to consummate the transaction. While we will take steps to ensure that our customers and counterparties have high credit standings and that financing transactions are
adequately collateralized, the large dollar amounts that may be involved in our broker-dealer and financing transactions could subject us to significant losses if, as a result of customer or counterparty failures to meet commitments, we were to
incur significant costs in liquidating or covering our positions in the open market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have adopted policies and procedures to identify, monitor and

our customers and counterparties. These policies and procedures, however, may not be fully effective, particularly against fraud, unauthorized trading and similar incidents. Some of these risk
management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or
properly evaluated. If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are, or may be, exposed, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our insurance policies do not provide coverage for these risks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Transactions executed on a
matched principal basis where the instrument has the same or similar characteristics to the counterparty may expose us to correlation risk. In this case, the counterparty&#146;s inability to meet its obligations will also result in the value of the
instrument declining. For example, if we were to enter into a transaction to sell to a customer a bond or structured note where the issuer or credit support provider was such customer&#146;s affiliate, the value of the instrument would decline in
value in tandem with the default. This correlation has the effect of magnifying the credit loss. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are subject to financing risk in these circumstances
because, if a transaction does not settle on a timely basis, the resulting unmatched position may need to be financed, either directly by us or through one of the clearing organizations, at our expense. These charges may be recoverable from the
failing counterparty, but sometimes they are not. In addition, in instances where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged or widespread due to rapid or widespread declines in liquidity for an instrument, there may also be
regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us, which, depending on their size and duration, could limit our business flexibility or even force the curtailment of those portions of our businesses requiring higher levels of capital. Credit or
settlement losses of this nature could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Declines in the
financial markets have also led to the exposure of several cases of financial fraud. If we were to have trading activity on an agency or principal basis with an entity engaged in defrauding investors or counterparties, we could bear the risk that
the counterparty would not have the financial resources to meet their obligations, resulting in a credit loss. Similarly, we may engage in financial transactions with third parties that have been victims of financial fraud that may not have the
financial resources to meet their obligations to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In agency transactions, we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in
the negotiation of the price and other material terms of the transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and leave them to settle the trade directly. We are exposed to credit
risk for commissions, as we bill customers for our agency brokerage services. Our customers may default on their obligations to us due to disputes, bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Any losses arising from such
defaults could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>In emerging market countries, we
primarily conduct our financial services businesses on an agency and matched principal basis, where the risk of counterparty default, inconvertibility events and sovereign default is greater than in more developed countries. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We enter into transactions in cash and derivative instruments primarily on an agency and matched principal basis with counterparties domiciled in countries in
Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Transactions with these counterparties are generally in instruments or contracts of sovereign or corporate issuers located in the same country as the counterparty. This exposes us to a higher degree of
sovereign or convertibility risk than in more developed countries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, these risks may entail correlated risks. A correlated risk arises when
the counterparty&#146;s inability to meet its obligations also corresponds to a decline in the value of the instrument traded. In the case of a sovereign convertibility event or outright default, the counterparty to the trade may be unable to pay or
transfer payment of an instrument purchased out of the country when the value of the instrument has declined due to the default or convertibility event. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The recent global financial crisis has heightened the risk of sovereign or convertibility events in emerging
markets similar to the events that occurred in previous financial downturns. Our risk management function monitors the creditworthiness of emerging countries and counterparties on an ongoing basis and, when the risk of inconvertibility or sovereign
default is deemed to be too great, correlated transactions or all transactions may be restricted or suspended. However, there can be no assurance that these procedures will be effective in controlling these risks. </P>

operations are substantially concentrated on rates products and could be significantly affected by any downturn or negative fluctuations in the rates product market. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We offer our financial services in four broad product categories: rates, credit, foreign exchange and equity and other asset classes. However, our financial
services brokerage revenues are substantially derived from our rates products, which accounted for approximately 39.4% of our total financial services brokerage revenues on a consolidated basis for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. While we
focus on expanding and diversifying our product offerings, we are currently exposed to any adverse change or condition affecting the rates product market. Accordingly, the concentration of our businesses on rates products subjects our results to a
greater market risk than if we had more diversified product offerings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Due to our current customer concentration, a loss of one or more of our
significant customers could harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014,
on a consolidated basis, our top ten Financial Services customers collectively, accounted for approximately 25.2% of our total revenues. We have limited long-term contracts with certain of these customers. If we were to lose one or more of these
significant customers for any reason, including the recent consolidation in the financial services industry, and not be compensated for such loss by doing additional business with other customers or by adding new customers, our revenues would
decline significantly and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would suffer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our financial services revenues and
profitability could be reduced or otherwise adversely affected by pricing plans relating to commissions and fees on our trading platform. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
negotiate from time to time with certain customers (including many of our largest customers) to enter into customized volume discount pricing plans. While the pricing plans are designed to encourage customers to be more active on our electronic
trading platform, they reduce the amount of commissions and fees payable to us by certain of our most active customers for certain products, which could reduce our revenues and constrain our profitability. From time to time, these pricing plans come
up for renewal. Failure of a number of our larger customers to enter into renewed agreements, or agreements on terms as favorable as existing agreements, could have a material adverse effect on volumes on our electronic trading platform, the
commissions payable to us, our revenues and our profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Reduced spreads in securities pricing, levels of trading activity and trading through

institutional investors, as well as broker-dealers. As such systems do not direct trades through market makers, their use could result in reduced revenues for us or for our customers. In

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses for a specified
position. In our Financial Services business, we may allow certain of our desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short investory positions. These transactions are primarily for the
purpose of managing proprietary positions, facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, we may have market risk exposure on these transactions. Our exposure varies based
on the size of the overall position, the terms and liquidity of the instruments brokered and the amount of time the position is held before we dispose of the position. We have limited ability to track our exposure to market risk and unmatched
positions on an intra-day basis, however, we attempt to mitigate market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging our exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to facilitate
customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, we may not be able to unwind the position and we may be forced to hold the position for a longer period
than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain categories of trades settle for clearing purposes against
CF&amp;Co, an affiliate of Cantor. CF&amp;Co is a member of FINRA and the FICC. We, CF&amp;Co and other of Cantor&#146;s and our affiliates participate in off-the-run U.S. Treasuries as well as other markets by posting quotations for our accounts
and by acting as principal. Such activity is intended, among other things, to assist us, CF&amp;Co, Cantor and other affiliates in managing proprietary positions (including, but not limited to, those established as a result of combination trades and
errors), facilitating transactions, framing markets, adding liquidity, increasing commissions and attracting order flow. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">From a risk management
perspective, we monitor risk on an end-of-day basis, and desk managers generally monitor such exposure on a continuous basis. Any unmatched positions are intended to be disposed of in the short term. However, due to a number of factors, including
the nature of the position and access to the markets on which we trade, we may not be able to match the position or effectively hedge its exposure and often may be forced to hold a position overnight that has not been hedged. To the extent these
unmatched positions are not disposed of intra-day, we mark these positions to market. Adverse movements in the securities underlying these positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a loss. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the event of any unauthorized trading activity or financial fraud that is not detected by management, it is possible that these unmatched positions could
be outstanding for a long period. At the time of any sales and settlements of these positions, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair
values. In addition, our estimates or determinations of the values of our various positions, assets or businesses are subject to the accuracy of our assumptions and the valuation models or multiples used. Any principal losses and gains resulting
from these positions could on occasion have disproportionate effects, negative or positive, on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for any particular reporting period. </P>

consideration related to the NASDAQ OMX shares is subject to fluctuations based on the NASDAQ OMX common stock share price. Therefore, if NASDAQ OMX were to experience financial difficulties or a significant downturn, we may be unable to realize the

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While we may seek to minimize the effect of price changes on the NASDAQ OMX shares we hold through the use of derivative contracts, no assurance can be given
that we will be able to enter into hedging activities that will adequately protect us from our exposure, or that the costs of such hedging activities will not be significant. Further, any such hedging activities and other risk management techniques
may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including unpredicted price movements, counterparty defaults or other risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. Any such events
could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, there is no assurance that

aggregate amount of approximately $332.8 million. In December 2014, we issued our 5.375% Senior Notes in anticipation of the acquisition, and we may enter into other short- or long-term financing arrangements. We will also incur substantial
non-recurring transaction costs, including break-up fees, assumption of liabilities and expenses, and compensation expenses in connection with the GFI transaction. Further, the consolidation of GFI for financial reporting purposes could
significantly increase the amount of our consolidated indebtedness apart from any additional indebtedness that we may incur in connection with any financing of the acquisition. Any such additional indebtedness may restrict the ability to raise

economic environment. Companies that are under financial pressure for any reason, or are attempting to more aggressively manage their expenses, may reduce the size of their workforces, reduce spending on capital expenditures, including with respect
to their office space, permit more of their staff to work from home offices and/or seek corresponding reductions in office space and related management or other services. </P>

sold or leased properties that we brokered or managed. We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales and leasing transactions, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, claiming that
we did not fulfill our statutory obligations. We could also become subject to claims made by clients for whom we provided appraisal and valuation services and/or third parties who perceive themselves as having been negatively affected by our

facilities management disputes or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our commercial real estate services business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to the extent we may be liable on our

may enter into agreements with clients where we manage the costs for a project. In these situations, we are responsible for managing the various other contractors required for a project, including general contractors, in order to ensure that the
cost of a project does not exceed the contract price and that the project is completed on time. In the event that one of the other contractors on the project does not or cannot perform as a result of bankruptcy or for some other reason, we may be

insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate. However, in the event of a substantial loss or certain types of claims, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages.
Additionally, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, insurance policies that we may have may not cover us at all. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible
in the event of the covering insurance company&#146;s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly-rated companies. In addition, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful

commercial real estate services we perform, we are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations specific to our services. For example, the brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and other
related activities require us to maintain brokerage licenses in each state in which we conduct activities for which a real estate license is required. If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct brokerage activities without a license or violate
any of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our licenses, then we may be subject to audits, required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or be prevented from collecting commissions owed, be compelled to return
commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, because the size and scope of commercial real estate sales transactions have
increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous state licensing and regulatory regimes and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. Furthermore, the laws,
rules and regulations applicable to our business lines also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance. The failure to comply with both foreign and domestic laws, rules and regulations could result in significant financial penalties
which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Environmental regulations may

may adversely affect the businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of our Real Estate Services segment. In addition, a failure by us to disclose environmental concerns in connection with a real estate transaction may

our knowledge of, or fault for, the release or contamination. Further, liability under some of these laws may be joint and several, meaning that one liable party could be held responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site. We could also
be subject to property damage or personal injury claims alleged to result from environmental contamination, or from asbestos-containing materials or lead-based paint present at the properties or facilities we manage. Insurance for such matters may

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any of our clients or other parties obligated to make payments to us may experience a downturn in their
businesses that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition. As a result, a client or other party obligated to make payments to us may fail to make payments when due, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any such failure to
make payments when due or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any such party could result in material losses to us. A bankruptcy of a client or other party obligated to make payments to us would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us.
Additionally, certain corporate services and property and facilities management agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients. If such a client or other party obligated to make payments to us were to file for
bankruptcy, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty (which may include co-brokers, owners, landlords, lenders, insurance
companies, hedging counterparties, service providers or other organizations with which we do business), or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual commitments, may result in disruption to our businesses and material
losses to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, any weakness in the global economy puts additional financial stress on clients and landlords, which sometimes are the parties
that pay our commissions and fees where we have placed a tenant client into their buildings. This in turn has negatively impacted our ability to collect our receivables fully or in a timely manner. We cannot be sure that the procedures we use to
identify and rectify slowly paid receivables, and to protect ourselves against the insolvencies or bankruptcies of clients, landlords and other third parties with which we do business, which procedures may involve placing liens on properties or
litigating, will be effective in all cases. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We may not be able to replace independently-owned partner offices when affiliation agreements are

collaborative and cross-referral basis with certain independently-owned offices in the U.S. and elsewhere in Americas in return for contractual and referral fees paid to us and/or certain mutually beneficial co-branding and other business
arrangements. These independently owned offices generally use some variation of Newmark in their names and marketing materials. These agreements are normally multi-year contracts, and generally provide for mutual referrals in their respective
markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees. Through these independently owned offices, our clients have access to additional brokers with local market research capabilities as well as other commercial real estate services in
locations where we do not have a physical presence. From time to time our arrangement with these independent firms may be terminated pursuant to the terms of the individual affiliation agreements. The opening of an owned office to replace an
independently-owned office requires us to invest capital, which in some cases could be material. In the event our affiliation arrangements are terminated, we may lose our market coverage in such market if we do not enter into a replacement
affiliation arrangement or open or acquire an owned office. There can be no assurance that, if we lose additional independently owned offices, we will be able to identify suitable replacement affiliates or fund the establishment or acquisition of an
owned office. In addition, although we do not control the activities of these independently owned offices, we may face reputational risk if any of these independently owned offices are involved in or accused of illegal, unethical or similar
behavior. Failure to maintain coverage in important geographic markets may negatively impact our operations, reputation, and ability to attract and retain key employees and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>RISKS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE AND PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE </B></P>

following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless the &#147;business combination&#148; or the transaction in which the person became an &#147;interested stockholder&#148; is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a

exchanging partners may receive a disproportionate interest in the aggregate distributions by BGC U.S. and BGC Global that have not been distributed by us. The reason is that the exchanging partner could receive both (1)&nbsp;the benefit of the

cash that otherwise would be distributed to our stockholders). Consequently, if our dividend policy does not match the distribution policy of BGC Holdings, other holders of Class&nbsp;A common stock and Class B common stock as of the date of an
exchange could experience a reduction in their interest in the profits previously distributed by BGC U.S. and BGC Global that have not been distributed by us. Our previously described intention to match the distribution policy of BGC Holdings was
superseded by a decision (which we announced on May&nbsp;7, 2008) by our board of directors to provide for greater flexibility by our management. Our current dividend policy could result in distributions to our common stockholders that are different

motivate these persons. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests entitle founding/working and other limited partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our businesses, upon leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any
other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests, as described below), any such founding/working or other limited partners are, unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and us, as the general partner of BGC Holdings,
otherwise determine, only entitled to receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such partner&#146;s capital account or
post-termination amount, if any, and not any goodwill or going concern value of our businesses. Further, certain partner units, such as PSUs and PSIs, have no right to a post-termination payment. Moreover, until units are made exchangeable, other

businesses on other outstanding BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, including those held by founding/working and other limited partners, to remain the same rather than increasing as would be the case if such interests were redeemed or

although the Internal Revenue Service may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge by the Internal Revenue Service. These increases in tax basis, if sustained, may reduce the amount of tax that we
would otherwise be required to pay in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a party to rights and obligations under a tax receivable agreement with Cantor that provides for

its entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. It is expected that we will benefit from the remaining 15% cash savings, if any, in income tax that we realize.

other stockholders. Further, our regulators, including the FCA, may require the consolidation, for regulatory purposes, of Cantor and its other affiliates and us with respect to our U.K.-regulated entities or other entities or require other

our Class&nbsp;A common stock. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Owners of our 4.50% Convertible Notes may employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to
the notes. Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the 4.50% Convertible Notes typically will implement that strategy by selling short our Class&nbsp;A common stock underlying the notes or by entering into cash-settled
OTC derivative transactions with respect to our Class&nbsp;A common stock that provide investors with short economic exposure to our Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the sale of the 4.50% Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with affiliates of Bank of America Merrill Lynch and
Deutsche Bank Securities, in connection with the pricing of the notes and the overallotment option to cover the shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock underlying the notes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our Class&nbsp;A common stock upon conversion of the
4.50% Convertible Notes in the event that the volume-weighted average price per share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions
(which initially corresponded to the original conversion price of the notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments). If, however, the volume-weighted average price per share of the Class&nbsp;A common stock, as measured under the terms of the
capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, the value of the shares of the Class&nbsp;A common stock that we expect to receive upon the exercise of the capped call transactions will be capped, and the dilution
mitigation under the capped call transactions will be limited based on such capped value, which means there would be dilution with respect to the Class&nbsp;A common stock to the extent that the then volume-weighted average price per share of the
Class&nbsp;A common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. A failure by a hedge counterparty (due to bankruptcy or otherwise) to pay or deliver, as the case may be, to us amounts owed to us under the capped call transactions
will not reduce the consideration we are required to deliver to a holder upon its conversion of the 4.50% Convertible Notes and may result in an increase in dilution with respect to our Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with hedging the capped call transactions, we believe the hedge counterparties may enter into, or may unwind, various derivative transactions
with respect to and/or purchase or sell our Class&nbsp;A common stock in secondary market transactions. Such arbitrage and hedging activities could have the effect of causing or avoiding an increase or decrease in the trading price of the
Class&nbsp;A common stock, including during any cash settlement averaging period relating to a conversion of the notes and following any conversion of the notes and during the period prior to the maturity date. The effect, if any, of any of these
transactions and activities on our Class&nbsp;A common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the market for and trading price of our Class&nbsp;A
common stock. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:18pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

the sole discretion of our board of directors. We are a holding company, with no direct operations, and therefore we are able to pay dividends only from our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions from BGC U.S. and BGC Global.
Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by regulatory considerations as well as by covenants contained in financing or other agreements. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is our net assets
minus our capital (as defined under Delaware law), or, if we have no surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Accordingly, any unanticipated accounting, tax, regulatory
or other charges against net income may adversely affect our ability to declare dividends. While we intend to declare and pay dividends quarterly, there can be no assurance that our board of directors will declare dividends at all or on a regular
basis or that the amount of our dividends will not change. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Share Repurchases and Unit Purchases </B></P>

August&nbsp;13, 2014 we acquired Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey Commercial (&#147;Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey&#148; or &#147;Cornish&#148;) and on December&nbsp;15, 2014 we announced an agreement to acquire Apartment Realty Advisers (&#147;ARA&#148;) and its
members. By adding the leading commercial real estate services company in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, and the nation&#146;s largest privately held, multi-housing brokerage, we have greatly broadened the scope and depth of services we can
provide to clients across the U.S. During the year we made a number of key acquisitions across our Financial Services business. In December 2014 we acquired R.P. Martin, a market-leading interdealer brokerage focusing on European interest rates and
foreign exchange products. In May 2014, we acquired Remate Lince, a leading Mexican inter-dealer broker focusing on interest rate derivatives and fixed income. And in February 2014 we purchased the assets of HEAT Energy Group, which specializes in
East Coast U.S. power brokerage. We also continued to make key hires around the world. We expect these additions to increase our earnings per share going forward. These investments underscore BGC&#146;s ongoing commitment to make accretive
acquisitions and profitably hire. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, our liquidity, which we define as cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and securities owned was in excess of $825 million, the majority of which we are free to deploy to increase stockholder and bondholder value, including as an example, the successful completion (on February 26, 2015) of our tender offer to
acquire the shares of GFI. We expect to issue payment for the tendered shares on March 3, 2015 in the aggregate amount of $332.8 million.&nbsp;We also expect to receive approximately $625 million in NASDAQ OMX over the next 13 years, based on the
February&nbsp;10, 2015 price of that company&#146;s shares. We believe that this provides us with significant amount of capital with which to pay dividends, profitably hire, and make accretive acquisitions, all while maintaining our investment grade

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;27, 2015 BGC and GFI Group Inc. (NYSE: GFIG) (&#147;GFI&#148;), announced the successful completion of BGC&#146;s tender offer
for GFI shares. As of the expiration of the tender offer at 5:00 PM on February&nbsp;26, 2015, approximately 54.6&nbsp;million shares were tendered pursuant to the offer. The 54.6&nbsp;million tendered shares, together with the 17.1&nbsp;million
shares of GFI common stock already owned by BGC, represent approximately 56.3% of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares. BGC has accepted the shares and expects to issue payment for the shares tendered on March&nbsp;3, 2015. In addition, GFI employees
holding RSUs will receive $6.10 per RSU in cash, based on their pre-existing vesting schedules.&nbsp;All outstanding conditions of the tender offer have been met. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">GFI will be a controlled company and operate as a division of BGC, reporting to Shaun Lynn, President of BGC, and its financial results will
be consolidated as part of BGC.&nbsp;Going forward, BGC and GFI are expected to remain separately branded divisions.&nbsp;GFI&#146;s current Executive Chairman, Michael Gooch, and its current Chief Executive Officer, Colin Heffron, will remain as
Executives and Directors of GFI Group and shall continue as Chairman and CEO, respectively, of the GFI Division.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe the
combination of BGC and GFI will create a strong and diversified company, well positioned to capture future growth opportunities.&nbsp;Through this combination, we expect to deliver substantial benefits to customers of the combined company, and we
expect to become the largest and most profitable wholesale brokerage company. We also believe this is a highly complementary combination, which will result in meaningful economies of scale.&nbsp;While the front office operations will remain
separately branded companies, we plan on integrating the back office, technology, and infrastructure of these two companies in a smart and deliberate way.&nbsp;By the end of the first year, we expect to save at least $50 million annually on items
including network infrastructure, telephone lines, data centers, vendors, disaster recovery, regulatory capital, and interest expense.&nbsp;We expect further cost savings in the second year and beyond.&nbsp;We also expect to generate increased
productivity per broker and to continue converting voice and hybrid broking to more profitable fully electronic trading, all of which should lead to increased revenues, profitability and cash flows. </P>

(&#147;NASDAQ OMX&#148;). NASDAQ OMX purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our affiliates, including the eSpeed brand name and various assets comprising the fully electronic portion of our benchmark on-the-run U.S.
Treasury brokerage, market data and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-location</FONT> service businesses (the &#147;Purchased Assets&#148; or &#147;eSpeed&#148;), for cash consideration of $750 million paid at closing, plus an earn-out of up to
14,883,705 shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock to be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing in which the consolidated gross revenue of NASDAQ OMX is equal to or greater than $25 million. Through December&nbsp;31, 2014, we have
received 1,984,494 shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock in accordance with the agreement. The contingent future issuances of NASDAQ OMX common stock are also subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events, including the acquisition by
any person of 50% or more of NASDAQ OMX&#146;s stock (including by merger), NASDAQ OMX ceasing to hold Purchased Assets representing 50% or more of the aggregate revenue attributable to the Purchased Assets as of the closing, and the sale of all or

sold our on-the-run; benchmark 2-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 30-year fully electronic trading platform for U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds. Over time, we had built these six instruments into some of the deepest and most liquid markets in the world. For the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, eSpeed generated approximately $48.6 million in revenues&#151;all of which was earned during the first two quarters, of which $46.5 million was recorded in our Financial Services segment and the remainder in
Corporate items. We retained all of our other voice, hybrid, and fully electronic trading, market data, and software businesses, including voice, hybrid and electronic brokerage of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">off-the-run</FONT></FONT> U.S. Treasuries, as well as Treasury Bills, Treasury Swaps, Treasury Repos, Treasury Spreads, and Treasury Rolls. We also continue to offer voice brokerage
for on-the-run U.S. Treasuries. As we continue to convert our voice and hybrid desks to electronic execution, our ebusiness generated approximately $99.0 million in revenues during 2014. Going forward we expect these businesses to become an even
more valuable part of BGC as they continue to grow faster than, and to be substantially larger than eSpeed ever was for us. For the purposes of this document, the assets sold may be referred to as &#147;eSpeed,&#148; and the fully electronic

claims for punitive damages, as well as their claims against executives of the Company and its subsidiaries, were denied in their entirety. Tullett Subsidiaries were found to have breached their contract with the people who sold them Chapdelaine
Corporate Securities&nbsp;&amp; Co. (many of whom now work for BGC) and were ordered to pay those individuals over $6 million in damages. The Tullett Subsidiaries were also found to have wrongly refused to pay compensation and expenses to one of
their former employees who now works for BGC, and whom was awarded over $222 thousand. BGC Financial and BGC Capital Markets (described together in the award and in this paragraph as &#147;BGC&#148;) were found solely liable for approximately $13
million in damages. Certain desk heads that moved to BGC were found liable for a total of approximately $20 million. BGC has paid the awards against these desk heads. The FINRA award did not have a material financial effect on BGC. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;13, 2015, BGC Partners entered into a settlement of previously disclosed litigation with Tullett Prebon plc
(&#147;Tullett&#148;) that resolves all ten outstanding lawsuits involving the two companies. In exchange for such agreement, BGC Partners agreed to pay $100 million in the aggregate to Tullett. The settlement amount is a fraction of the amount that
Tullett originally claimed, which, as previously reported, was in excess of $1 billion. In addition, on January&nbsp;2, 2015, the judge dismissed Tullett&#146;s RICO claim, noting that Tullett had not produced enough evidence to support its claims.

intermediary sector has been a competitive area that has grown over the past decade due to several factors. One factor is the increasing use of derivatives to manage risk or to take advantage of the anticipated direction of a market by allowing
users to protect gains and/or guard against losses in the price of underlying assets without having to buy or sell the underlying assets. Derivatives are often used to mitigate the risks associated with interest rates, equity ownership, changes in
the value of foreign currency, credit defaults by corporate and sovereign debtors and changes in the prices of commodity products. Over the past decade, demand from financial institutions, financial services intermediaries and large corporations has
increased volumes in the wholesale derivatives market, thereby increasing the business opportunity for financial intermediaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Another
key factor in the growth of the financial intermediary sector over the past decade has been the increase in the number of new financial products. As market participants and their customers strive to mitigate risk, new types of equity and fixed
income securities, futures, options and other financial instruments have been developed. Most of these new securities and derivatives are not immediately ready for more liquid and standardized electronic markets, and generally increase the need for
trading and require <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">broker-assisted</FONT> execution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In recent years, our Financial Services businesses
have faced challenging market conditions. While our Foreign Exchange (&#147;FX&#148;) and Equities and other businesses operated in a generally improved macro environment towards the end of 2014 our Rates and Credit businesses continued to face a
challenging macro backdrop. The continued low volume environment facing our Rates and Credit businesses has been part of a greater industry trend that has been attributed to a number of cyclical factors, including extreme monetary policies by
several major central banks including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and more recently, the European Central Bank. These accommodative monetary policies have resulted in historically low levels of volatility and interest rates
across most financial markets. The global credit markets have also faced structural issues such as the higher bank capital requirements under Basel III. Consequently, these factors contributed to lower trading volumes in our Rates and Credit asset
classes across most geographies in which we operate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Regulators in the U.S. have finalized most of the new rules across a range of
financial marketplaces, including OTC derivatives, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;).&nbsp;Many of these rules became effective during 2013 and 2014 with ongoing phase-ins
anticipated over the course of the coming years.&nbsp;Legislators and regulators in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have crafted similar rules, some of which were implemented in 2014, specifically those falling under the Markets in Financial
Instruments Directive II (&#147;MiFID II&#148;), while others are expected to be implemented in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These OTC-related regulations
and proposed rules call for additional pre- and post-trade market transparency, heightened collateral and capital standards, the transacting of certain derivatives using authorized venues, central clearing of most standardized derivatives, specific
business conduct standards and the delivery of transaction data to newly designated trade repositories for public dissemination. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC
Derivative Markets, a subsidiary of the Company, began operating as a Swap Execution Facility (&#147;SEF&#148;) on October&nbsp;2, 2013. Since then, mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants
commenced in February 2014 for a small number of &#147;made available to trade&#148; products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized. BGC Derivative Markets has been active
across the full range of Required and Permitted Products executed by U.S.-based customers and we anticipate improved derivatives volumes once the international regulatory landscape becomes clearer for our clients that operate globally. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that our relative competitive position is strong in this new environment, and that we
will gain market share in the U.S. This is because the new rules not only require OTC market execution venues to maintain robust front-end and back-office IT capabilities and to make large and ongoing technology investments, but also because recent
revisions to the execution methodology rules will allow elements of voice brokerage to flourish. We are a leader in both the breadth and scale of our hybrid and fully electronic trading capability, and we expect to outperform our competitors in such
an environment. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Growth Drivers </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a wholesale intermediary, our business is driven primarily by overall industry volumes in the markets in which we broker, the size and
productivity of our front-office headcount (including salespeople, brokers and other front-office professionals), regulatory issues and the percentage of our revenues related to fully electronic brokerage. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Below is a brief analysis of the market and industry volumes for some of our financial services products including our overall hybrid and
fully electronic trading activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Overall Market Volumes and Volatility </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Volume is driven by a number of items, including the level of issuance for financial instruments, the price volatility of financial
instruments, macro-economic conditions, the creation and adoption of new products, the regulatory environment, and the introduction and adoption of new trading technologies. In general, increased price volatility increases the demand for hedging
instruments, including many of the cash and derivative products that we broker. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Rates volumes in particular are influenced by market
volatility, which has been dampened due to continued quantitative easing undertaken by the various central banks. Quantitative easing entails the central banks buying government securities or other securities in the open market&#151;particularly
longer-dated instruments&#151;in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity and bring down long-term interest rates. When central banks hold these instruments, they tend not to trade or hedge&#151;thus lowering rates volumes across cash
and derivatives markets industry-wide. Despite the conclusion of its Quantitative Easing program in the fourth quarter of this year, the U.S. Federal Reserve still had approximately $3.9 trillion worth of long-dated U.S. Treasury and Federal Agency
securities as at February&nbsp;4, 2015, compared with $1.7 trillion at the beginning of 2011 and zero prior to September 2008. Other major central banks have also greatly increased the amount of longer-dated debt on their balance sheets over the
past three years or signaled a willingness to do so. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the G-20 central banks have agreed to implement the Basel III accord.
Basel III was drafted with the intention of making banks more stable in the wake of the financial crisis. The accord, which will be phased in over the next few years, will force most large banks in G-20 nations to hold approximately three times as
much Tier 1 capital as is required under the previous set of rules. The new capital rules make it more expensive for banks to hold non-sovereign debt assets on their balance sheets, and as a result, analysts say banks have reduced or will reduce
their trading activity in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. We believe that this has reduced overall industry volumes in many of the products we trade, particularly in
Credit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, industry volumes were generally mixed for most of the OTC and listed products we
broker in Rates, Credit, FX and Equities and other, as compared with 2013. For example, volumes were generally up within FX and Equities, while volumes were generally down within Rates and Credit. Below is a discussion of the volume and growth
drivers of our various financial services brokerage product categories. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Rates Volumes and Volatility </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Rates business is influenced by a number of factors, including; global sovereign issuances, secondary trading and the hedging of these
sovereign debt instruments. While the amount of global sovereign debt outstanding remains high by historical standards, the level of secondary trading and related hedging activity remains muted. For example, according to the Federal Reserve, the
average daily volume of U.S. Treasuries amongst primary dealers was down by over 8% as compared with a year earlier. Additionally, interest rate volumes were down by approximately 15% and 8% at ICE and Eurex, respectively. Our revenues from Rates
products were down by 18.3% during the period to $401.6 million. Excluding eSpeed, revenues from our Rates products were down by 12.8% to $401.6 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Rates revenues are not totally dependent on market volumes and therefore do not always fluctuate consistently with industry metrics. This
is largely because our voice, hybrid, and fully electronic desks in rates often have volume discounts built into their price structure, which results in our rates revenues being less volatile than the overall industry volumes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;page-break-before:always"></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Overall, analysts and economists expect the absolute level of
sovereign debt outstanding to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future as governments finance their future deficits and roll over their sizable existing debt. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(&#147;OECD&#148;)&#151;which includes almost all of the advanced and developed economies of the world&#151;reported that general government debt as a percentage of GDP will be 71.7% for the entire OECD in 2016. This would represent a slight
increase from 69.4% in 2013, but is nearly double the 39.1% figure in 2007. Meanwhile, economists expect that the effects of various forms of quantitative easing will continue to negatively impact financial markets, as economic growth remains weak
in most OECD countries. As a result, we expect long-term tailwinds in our Rates business from continuing high levels of government debt, but continued near-term headwinds due to the continued accommodative monetary policy of many major central
banks. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The cash portion of our credit business is impacted by the level of global corporate bond issuance, while both the cash and credit derivatives
sides of this business are impacted by sovereign and corporate issuance. Global credit derivative market turnover has declined due to uncertainty surrounding recently enacted rules for the clearing of credit derivatives in the U.S. along with
non-uniform regulation across different geographies.&nbsp;In addition, corporate and asset-backed bond trading has continued to decline for many of our large bank customers as they reduce their inventory of bonds in order to comply with Basel III
and other international financial regulations. During the period, primary dealer average daily volumes for corporate and mortgaged-backed bonds (&#147;MBS&#148;)&#151;a reflection of the cash market&#151;exhibited mixed trends, with corporate bonds
volumes down by 1%, Federal Agency bonds up by 8%, while non-agency MBS bond volumes were down 17% from a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve. Total dealer gross notional credit derivatives outstanding as reported by SIFMA&#151;a reflection
of the inter-dealer derivatives market&#151;was down by over 25% from the prior period. Our overall credit revenues declined by 7.6% to $225.9 million, which was reflective of difficult volume trends within the global inter-bank credit markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Foreign Exchange Volumes and Volatility </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Global FX volumes were generally mixed during 2014, largely as a result of certain regulatory investigations that took place during the first
half of the year, offset by an uptick in volatility in the second half of the year, primarily related to diverging monetary policy across many central banks. Our fully electronic FX revenues increased 10.2%, while our overall FX revenues increased
1.4% to $215.2 million. In comparison, spot FX volumes decreased by approximately 8% at Thomson Reuters and FX futures decreased by 9% at the CME. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Equities and Other Asset Classes </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Global equity markets were generally up during the period. The number of U.S. shares traded was up 4% while notional value of European shares
trades increased by 22%, according to Credit Suisse Equity Research. According to the OCC, average daily equity option volumes were up 4% versus 2013. Energy volumes were down 11% and 3% at ICE and CME, while commodities volumes were down 9% at the
ICE and up 2% at CME as compared with 2013. In comparison, our overall revenues from Equities and other asset classes increased by 17.0% to $176.3 million. Of this amount, energy and commodities revenues were up by approximately 78%, largely driven
by the acquisition of HEAT Energy Group during the year, along with the successful hiring of a number of new brokers. We believe we gained market share in energy and commodities during the year. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Hybrid and Fully Electronic Trading </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Historically, technology-based product growth has led to higher margins and greater profits over time for exchanges and wholesale financial
intermediaries alike, even if overall company revenues remain consistent. This is largely because fewer employees are needed to process the same volume of trades as trading becomes more automated. Over time, electronification of exchange-traded and
OTC markets has also generally led to volumes increasing faster than commissions decline, and thus often to an overall increase in revenues. We have been a pioneer in creating and encouraging hybrid and fully electronic trading, and continually work
with our customers to expand such trading across more asset classes and geographies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Outside of U.S. Treasuries and spot FX, the banks
and broker-dealers that dominate the OTC markets had generally been hesitant in adopting electronically traded products. However, in recent years, hybrid and fully electronic inter-dealer OTC markets for products, including CDS indices, FX options,
and most recently interest rate swaps, have been created as banks and dealers have become more open to electronically traded products and as firms like us have invested in the kinds of technology favored by our customers. Recently enacted and
pending regulation in Asia, Europe and the U.S. regarding banking, capital markets, and OTC derivatives is likely to accelerate the spread of fully electronic trading and we expect to benefit from the new rules regarding OTC derivatives once they
are finalized globally.&nbsp;Our understanding is that the rules that have been promulgated or are being discussed will continue to allow for trading through a variety of means, including voice, and we believe the net impact of these rules and the
new bank capital requirements will encourage the growth of fully electronic trading for a number of products we broker. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The combination
of more market acceptance of hybrid and fully electronic trading and our competitive advantage in terms of technology and experience has contributed to our strong gains in electronically traded products. During 2014, we continued to invest in hybrid
and fully electronic technology broadly across our financial services product categories. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Financial Services electronic trading,
market data and software solutions revenue &#150; excluding eSpeed &#150; increased by 22.7% to $99.0 million or 9.5% of segment revenue for the period, as compared with $80.7 million or 7.5% in the prior period. The increase in these retained
technology-based revenues for the quarter was due in part to growth from the brokerage of fully electronic Credit, Rates and Spot FX as well as higher market data revenues. We now offer electronically traded products on a significant portion of our
Financial Services segment&#146;s more than 200 Financial Services desks. We expect the proportion of desks offering electronically traded products to continue to increase as we invest in technology to drive electronic trading over our platform.
Over time, we expect the growth of our technology-based businesses to further improve this segment&#146;s profitability. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&nbsp;14, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Newmark. On April&nbsp;13, 2012, we acquired substantially all of the assets of
Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively &#147;Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis&#148;). Newmark, Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis and certain independently-owned partner offices of the two, operate as &#147;Newmark Grubb
Knight Frank&#148; in the Americas, and are associated with London-based Knight Frank. Our discussion of financial results for &#147;Newmark Grubb Knight Frank,&#148; &#147;NGKF,&#148; or &#147;Real Estate Services&#148; reflects only those
businesses owned by us and does not include the results for Knight Frank or for the independently-owned offices that use some variation of the NGKF name in their branding or marketing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">NGKF is a full-service commercial real estate services platform, offering commercial real estate tenants, owners, investors and developers a
wide range of services, including leasing and corporate advisory, investment sales and financial services (&#147;real estate capital markets&#148;), consulting, project and development management, and property and facilities management. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Real Estate Services segment continued to show solid growth and generated approximately 40% of our revenues in the year-ended 2014. Real
Estate brokerage revenues grew by 31.7% year-over-year. NGKF&#146;s growth was primarily driven by the addition of Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey, by double-digit organic growth in our capital markets and leasing brokerage revenues, and by our Global
Corporate Services business. While we benefited from positive industry trends, we believe that NGKF once again made strong market share gains. Our Real Estate management services and other revenues were up by 0.4%; and overall revenues improved by
22.8%. Our intra-year acquisitions of Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey and ARA are expected to drive future growth of our Real Estate Services business, particularly in the higher margin capital markets brokerage space. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Cornish is the leading commercial real estate services company in the important Bay Area and Silicon Valley markets. Cornish had over 275
brokers and generated approximately $135 million in revenues in 2013. The Bay Area is a top region for new business generation in the U.S. This acquisition will solidify our West Coast presence and further reinforce NGKF&#146;s position as a
dominant industry force that offers clients the full range of commercial real estate services provided by best-in class brokers in multiple disciplines and geographies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ARA is the nation&#146;s largest privately held, full-service investment brokerage network that focuses exclusively on the <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">multi-housing</FONT> industry. Subsequent to closing, the ARA acquisition is expected to generate additional revenues in excess of $100 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Results from Cornish and ARA were included within our Real Estate business only for the periods under which they were controlled by BGC. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect the overall profitability of our Real Estate Services business to increase as we increase its size and scale. However, the pre-tax
margins in the segment are also impacted by the mix of revenues generated by NGKF. For example, real estate capital markets, which includes sales, commercial mortgage broking, and other financial services, generally has larger transactions that
occur with less frequency when compared with leasing advisory. However, real estate capital markets brokerage tends to have significantly higher pre-tax margins than NGKF as a whole. Leasing advisory revenues are generally more predictable than
revenues from real estate capital markets, while pre-tax earnings margins tend to be more similar to those of the segment as a whole. Property and facilities management, which together are called &#147;real estate management services,&#148;
generally have the most predictable and steady revenues, but pre-tax earnings margins below those for NGKF as a whole. When management services clients agree to give us exclusive rights to provide real estate services for their facilities or
properties, it is for an extended period of time, which provides us with stable and foreseeable sources of brokerage revenues. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Growth Drivers </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The key drivers of revenue growth for U.S. commercial real estate brokerage services companies include the overall health of the U.S. economy,
including gross domestic product and employment trends in the U.S., which drives demand for various types of commercial leases and purchases; the institutional ownership of commercial real estate as an investible asset class; and the ability to
attract and retain talent to our real estate services platform. In addition, in real estate sales, also known as real estate capital markets, growth is driven by the availability of credit to purchasers of and investors in commercial real estate.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Economic Growth in the U.S. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The U.S. economy is believed to have expanded by an annualized rate of 2.4% during 2014 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis&#146;s preliminary estimate, as compared to an increase of 2.2% in 2013. U.S. economic growth was largely exhibited during the second half of the year, as real gross domestic product growth accelerated in the third and fourth quarters. </P>

monthly average of 260,000 net new payroll jobs during the year, as compared to 199,000 in the prior period. Despite the return to pre-recession unemployment rates (5.7% as of January 2015), the long-term unemployment and the declining labor force
participation rate (near a 35-year low) remain disappointing for many economists, but these indicators are less important to commercial real estate than job creation. Nonetheless, economists were generally encouraged by the fact that job creation
over the three months ended January&nbsp;31, 2015, totaled over 1&nbsp;million, which was the fastest pace since 1999. In addition, the January jobs report showed that the civilian labor force rose by 703,000, and that the labor force participation
rate rose by 0.2 percentage points month over month to 62.9 percent. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The 10-year Treasury yield ended the year at 2.17% after rising from its low of 1.63% on
May&nbsp;2, 2013. Treasury yields have remained low by historical standards, despite the Federal Reserve&#146;s continued tapering of its quantitative easing program. This has been in large part due to tempered expectations surrounding the Federal
Open Market Committee (&#147;FOMC&#148;) willingness to raise the federal funds rate in the near-term. In October 2014, the FOMC formally ended its quantitative easing program, which was responsible for the purchase of over $4.5 trillion worth of
Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. In the FOMC&#146;s most recent January 2015 meeting, the Committee stated it was &#147;unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings.&#148; This guidance, along
with declining energy prices in early 2015, has led most economists to forecast sustained low interest rates into 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The combination
of moderate economic growth and low interest rates that has been in place since the recession ended has been a powerful stimulus for commercial real estate, delivering steady absorption of excess space and strong investor demand for the yields
available through both direct townership of assets and publicly traded funds. Steady economic growth and low interest rates helped push vacancy rates down for the office, apartment, retail and industrial markets. The low level of new construction
over the past few years has meant that tenants have been funneled into existing vacant space with the exception of apartments, where construction has propelled the market into a new expansion cycle. Asking rental rates posted moderate gains across
all property types in 2014, propelled by demand for Class&nbsp;A assets in the top submarkets. The following trends drove the commercial real estate market in 2014: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:13%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Strong U.S. employment growth and rising home values have fueled the economy and generated increased demand for commercial real estate space

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following the financial crisis of 2007/2008, the U.S. commercial property market saw steep declines in activity in 2009. In 2010, the market
began to recover, and by the end of 2011 there were signs that the recovery was gaining momentum&#151;although still not at levels seen prior to the crisis. If the U.S. economy expands by 3% or more in 2015, the pace envisioned by many economists,
we would expect this to fuel the continued expansion of demand for commercial real estate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although overall industry metrics are not
necessarily as correlated to our revenues in Real Estate Services as they are in Financial Services, they do provide some indication of the general direction of the business. According to Newmark Grubb Knight Frank Research, the overall vacancy rate
for office properties in the nation&#146;s key markets ended 2014 at 14.3%, down from 15.0% a year earlier, marking the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2008. Employment growth&#151;the primary driver of demand for office leasing
activity&#151;accelerated during the final quarter of 2014, which should provide continued momentum for the office market recovery. Rents for all property types in the U.S. continued to improve modestly. CoStar Group (a leading provider of
information and analytic services) reported that net absorption for office, retail and industrial space increased by 22.6% for the trailing twelve months ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In terms of commercial real estate sales metrics, according to CoStar&#146;s Value-Weighted U.S. Composite Index, average prices were up 11%
year-over-year in 2014. During the year, the dollar volume of significant property sales rose by 17% above the year ago period according to Real Capital Analytics. In comparison, our Real Estate Services brokerage revenue increased by 31.7%
year-over-year, primarily due to growth resulting from the acquisitions of Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey and strong organic growth. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have invested significantly to capitalize on the current business environment through
acquisitions, technology spending and the hiring of new brokers, salespeople and other front-office professionals. The business climate for these acquisitions has been competitive, and it is expected that these conditions will persist for the
foreseeable future. We have been able to attract businesses and brokers, salespeople and other front-office professionals to our platform as we believe they recognize that we have the scale, technology, experience and expertise to succeed in the

salespeople and other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">front-office</FONT> professionals. This increase was primarily due in part to the acquisition of Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey, ARA and R.P. Martin. For the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">year-ended</FONT> 2014, average revenue generated per front-office employee increased 2% from a year ago to approximately $629,000. The increase in overall company revenue per front-office employee was primarily
driven by an increase in revenue per front-office employee in Real Estate Services, which increased over 20% from the prior period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
laws and regulations passed or proposed on both sides of the Atlantic concerning OTC trading seem likely to favor increased use of technology by all market participants, and are likely to accelerate the adoption of both hybrid and fully electronic
trading. We believe these developments will favor the larger inter-dealer brokers over smaller, non-public inter-dealer brokers, as the smaller ones generally do not have the financial resources to invest the necessary amounts in technology. We
believe this will lead to further consolidation in our industry, and thus further allow us to profitably grow our front-office headcount. </P>

commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other material terms of the transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and
leave them to settle the trade directly. Principal transaction revenues are primarily derived from matched principal transactions, whereby revenues are earned on the spread between the buy and the sell price of the brokered security, commodity or
derivative. Customers either see the buy or sell price on a screen or are given this information over the phone. The brokerage fee is then added to the buy or sell price, which represents the spread we earn as principal transactions revenues. On a

decline as a percentage of revenues as we continue to invest in expanding in other asset classes such as real estate, credit derivatives, foreign exchange, energy, commodities and equity-related products. These factors have enabled us to provide our
client base with robust services across global markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our position as a leading broker is enhanced by our hybrid brokerage platform. We
believe that the more complex, less liquid markets on which we focus often require significant amounts of personal and attentive service from our brokers. In more mature markets, we offer electronic trading capabilities to our customers through our
BGC Trader platform. Our hybrid platform allows our customers to trade on a voice, hybrid or, where available, fully electronic basis, regardless of whether the trade is OTC or exchange-based, and to benefit from the experience and market
intelligence of our worldwide brokerage network. Our electronic capabilities include clearing, settlement and other back-office services as well as straight-through processing for our customers across several products. Furthermore, we participate in
the operational leverage from our fully electronic platform. We believe our hybrid brokerage approach provides a competitive advantage over competitors who do not offer this full range of technology. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We generate interest income primarily from the investment of our daily cash balances, interest earned on securities owned and reverse

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The majority of our operating costs consist of cash and non-cash compensation expenses, which include base salaries, broker bonuses based on
broker production, guaranteed bonuses, other discretionary bonuses, and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of brokers, executives and other administrative support. The majority of our brokers receive a base salary and a
formula bonus based primarily on a pool of brokers&#146; production for a particular product or sales desk, as well as on the individual broker&#146;s performance. Members of our sales force receive either a base salary or a draw on commissions.
Less experienced salespeople typically receive base salaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As part of our compensation plans employees are granted Limited partnership
units in BGC Holdings which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, that are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in FASB guidance, the
quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocation of net income and grant of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in the
Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive
post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">post-termination</FONT> liability
awards under FASB guidance, which requires that the Company record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations as part of
&#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout amount is included in &#147;Accrued compensation&#148; on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into Class&nbsp;A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to
adjustment). At the time exchangeability is granted, the Company recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in &#147;Allocation of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units
and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has also awarded Preferred Units. Each quarter,
the net profits of BGC Holdings are allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the &#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;), which is deducted
before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred
Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not included in the Company&#146;s fully diluted share count.
The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under &#147;Allocation of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated
statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals
receive loans which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of time. The forgivable portion of these loans is
recognized as compensation expense over the life of the loan. From time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the
timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we also enter into deferred compensation agreements with employees
providing services to us. The costs associated with such plans are generally amortized over the period in which they vest. See Note 19&#151;&#147;Compensation&#148; to our consolidated financial statements. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We incur tax expenses based on the location, legal structure and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of our subsidiaries. Certain of our
entities are treated as U.S. partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, much of the income is not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes because taxes related to income earned by partnerships represent obligations of the
individual partners. The partners&#146; liability or benefit is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Outside of the U.S., we operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes. Our consolidated
financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on our allocable share of the U.S. results of operations, as well as taxes payable to jurisdictions outside the U.S. </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2014 we had a loss from operations before taxes of $3.2 million compared to income from operations before income taxes of $265.9 million in the year earlier period. Total revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 increased
approximately $42.5 million to $1,787.5 million primarily due to increased brokerage revenues. Total expenses decreased approximately $397.4 million to $1,834.8 million primarily due to the significant compensation charges of $465.0 million recorded
during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 related to our Global Partnership Restructuring Program. This decrease was partially offset by a $50.0 million increase on other expenses primarily driven by costs associated with hiring brokers and the
settlement of litigation. Other Income (losses), net decreased by $709.0 million to $44.1 million. This was primarily due to the $723.1 million gain on divestiture recorded in 2013 related to our sale of eSpeed to NASDAQ OMX in June 2013. The impact
of this prior year gain was partially offset by a $13.3 million increase in other income related to the NASDAQ earn-out shares and the related mark-to-market movements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Real Estate Services business had a strong year that ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. NGKF&#146;s performance was driven by a combination of
the addition of Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey, double-digit organic growth in brokerage revenues, increased revenues from its Global Corporate Services business, and better operating efficiencies resulting from the successful integration of previous
acquisitions. While the conditions in the financial markets remained challenging we continued to achieve significant growth in our higher margin fully electronic businesses. Going forward, we expect these businesses to become an even more valuable
part of BGC. With our December&nbsp;31, 2014 liquidity in excess of $825 million, and approximately $625 million still expected to be received in NASDAQ OMX stock over the next 13 years, we expect to have more than a billion dollars available to
fuel the growth of the Company. We anticipate using these funds to repay debt, repurchase common shares and units, and/or to maintain our regular common dividend for the foreseeable future. We also expect to continue making accretive acquisitions
across both Real Estate Services and Financial Services. An excellent example is our recent successful tender offer for the shares of GFI Group Inc. (&#147;GFI&#148;). We are confident that a combination of GFI and BGC will deliver significant

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The increase in brokerage revenues was primarily driven by increases in Real Estate, FX and Equities and other asset classes, partially offset

December&nbsp;31, 2013, however our overall credit revenues declined by 7.6% to $225.9 million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. This decrease was mainly due to lower overall industry-wide inter-dealer activity in credit derivatives,
investment-grade corporate bonds, and non-agency mortgage bonds. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our FX revenues were up by 1.4% to $215.2 million for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2014. This increase was primarily driven by growth across on voice, hybrid, and fully electronic desks most notably in our e-brokered foreign exchange spot and derivative products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Real Estate brokerage revenues increased by $129.9 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. This increase was primarily driven by
growth in the leasing and consulting businesses, increased operating efficiencies resulting from the successful integration of acquisitions and continued improvements in broker productivity. </P>

December 31, 2013. The decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues related to ELX (as a result of the sale of the eSpeed business) and lower technology service fees. </P>

year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The main driver of this decrease was a charge of $160.5 million taken during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 related to the reduction of compensation-related partnership loans in connection with our Global
Partnership Restructuring Program. The decrease was partially offset by increased compensation expense associated with higher brokerage revenues during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 </P>

to general market deterioration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Real Estate brokerage revenues increased by $82.0 million, or 24.8%, for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase was primarily due to growth resulting from the acquisition of Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis in the second quarter of 2012 as well as our other recent acquisitions (Frederick Ross and Smith Mack) and organic growth.

according to the Options Clearing Corporation, but were down by approximately 12% and 28%, respectively, according to the Eurex and Euronext. Energy and commodities volumes were also generally flat or down year-over-year according to the CME and

operations before income taxes.&#148; In addition to the two business segments, the tables below include a &#147;Corporate Items&#148; category. Corporate revenues include fees from related parties and interest income as well as gains that are not
considered part of the Company&#146;s ordinary, ongoing business. Corporate expenses include non-cash compensation expenses (such as the grant of exchangeability to limited partnership units; redemption/exchange of partnership units, issuance of
restricted shares and allocations of net income to founding/working partner units and limited partnership units) as well as unallocated expenses such as certain professional and consulting fees, executive compensation and interest expense, which are
managed separately at the corporate level. </P>

Our assets consist largely of cash, collateralized and uncollateralized short-dated receivables and less liquid assets needed to support our business. Longer-term capital (equity and notes payable) is held to support the less liquid assets and
potential capital intensive opportunities. Total assets at December&nbsp;31, 2014 were $2.8 billion, an increase of 32.3% as compared to December&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase in total assets was driven primarily by increases in receivables from
broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers, Marketable securities and goodwill. The increase in Receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers related to an increase in
open fail to deliver contracts and was offset by a corresponding increase in open fail to receive contracts which are included in Payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers. We maintain a significant
portion of our assets in cash, with our liquidity (which we define as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and securities owned) at December&nbsp;31, 2014 of $825.5 million. See &#147;Liquidity Analysis&#148; below for a further
discussion of our liquidity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;26, 2015 we successfully completed our tender offer to acquire the shares of GFI common
stock (the &#147;shares&#148;), for $6.10 per share in cash and accepted for purchase approximately 54.6&nbsp;million shares (the &#147;Tendered Shares&#148;) tendered to us pursuant to our offer. The tendered shares together with the
17.1&nbsp;million shares already owned by us, represent approximately 56.3% of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares. We expect to issue payment for the Tendered Shares on March&nbsp;3, 2015 in the aggregate amount of $332.8 million. </P>

August 2013, the Audit Committee authorized us to invest up to $350 million in an asset-backed commercial paper program for which certain Cantor entities serve as placement agent and referral agent. The program issues short-term notes to money
market investors and is expected to be used from time to time as a liquidity management vehicle. The notes are backed by assets of highly rated banks. We are entitled to invest in the program so long as the program meets investment policy
guidelines, including relating to ratings. Cantor will earn a spread between the rate it receives from the short-term note issuer and the rate it pays to us on any investments in this program. This spread will be no greater than the spread earned by
Cantor for placement of any other commercial paper note in the program. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had $125 million invested in the program. </P>

meet clearing bank, clearinghouse, and exchange margins and/or to fund fails. Capital expenditures tend to be cash neutral and approximately in line with depreciation. Current cash balances significantly exceed our unsecured letters of credit and
our unsecured bank borrowings. We believe that cash in and available to our largest regulated entities, inclusive of financing provided by clearing banks, is adequate for potential cash demands of normal operations such as margin or fail financing.
We expect our operating activities going forward to generate adequate cash flows to fund normal operations, including any dividends issued pursuant to our dividend policy. However, we believe that there are a significant number of capital intensive
opportunities for us to maximize our growth and strategic position, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures potentially involving all types and combinations of equity, debt and acquisition alternatives. As

2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the offering of the 4.50% Convertible Notes, we entered into capped call transactions, which are expected to
reduce the potential dilution of our Class&nbsp;A common stock upon any conversion of 4.50% Convertible Notes in the event that the market value per share of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions,
is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions ($10.62 as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The capped call transactions had an initial cap price equal to $12.30 per share (50% above the
last reported sale price of our Class&nbsp;A common stock on the NASDAQ on July&nbsp;25, 2011), and had a cap price equal to approximately $13.27 per share as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $144.2 million after deducting the initial purchasers&#146; discounts and commissions,
estimated offering expenses and the cost of the capped call transactions. We used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including financing acquisitions. </P>

June&nbsp;26, 2012, we issued an aggregate of $112.5 million principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2042. The 8.125% Senior Notes are our senior unsecured obligations. The 8.125% Senior Notes may be redeemed for cash, in whole or in part, on or
after June&nbsp;26, 2017, at our option, at any time and from time to time, until maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but
not including, the redemption date. The 8.125% Senior Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#147;BGCA.&#148; We used the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and for
general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The initial carrying value of the 8.125% Senior Notes was $108.7 million, net of debt issuance costs of $3.8 million. CF&amp;Co, an affiliate of us, served as one of the underwriters in this
transaction and was paid an underwriting fee of approximately $0.2 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>5.375% Senior Notes </I></P>

Senior Notes&#148;). The 5.375% Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 5.375% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.375%&nbsp;per year, payable in cash on June&nbsp;9 and December&nbsp;9 of each year,
commencing June&nbsp;9, 2015. The interest rate payable on the notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time based on the debt rating assigned by specified rating agencies to the notes, as set forth in the Indenture. The 5.375% Senior Notes
will mature on December&nbsp;9, 2019. The Company may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time for cash at certain &#147;make-whole&#148; redemption prices (as set forth in the Indenture). If a &#147;Change of Control
Triggering Event&#148; (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The initial carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes was $295.1 million, net of
the discount and debt issuance costs of $4.9 million. The issuance costs are amortized as interest cost, and the carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the notes. The Company recorded interest
expense related to the 5.375% Senior Notes of $1.0 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. There was no interest expense related to the 5.375% Senior Notes for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On various dates beginning in 2009 and most recently in December 2012, we entered into secured loan arrangements under which we pledged certain
fixed assets in exchange for loans. The secured loan arrangements had fixed rates between 2.62% and 8.09%&nbsp;per annum and were repayable in consecutive monthly installments with the final payments due in December 2016. During the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2013, we prepaid $26.7 million related to secured loan arrangements and during the six months ended June&nbsp;30, 2014, we prepaid the remaining balance. Therefore, there were no secured loan arrangement balances as of
December&nbsp;31, 2014. The outstanding balance of the secured loan arrangements was $1.6 million and as of December&nbsp;31, 2013. The value of the fixed assets pledged was $1.5 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On various dates during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2010 and 2011, we sold certain furniture, equipment and software for $34.2 million,
net of costs and concurrently entered into agreements to lease the property back. The principal and interest on the leases were repayable in equal monthly installments for terms of 36 months (software) and 48 months (furniture and equipment) with
maturities through September 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, we terminated the leases and prepaid the outstanding

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the leases were terminated during 2013, we had no outstanding balance or fixed assets
pledged related to the leases as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 or 2013. We recorded interest expense of $0.7 million and $1.1 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because assets reverted back to us at the end of the leases, the transactions were capitalized. As a result, consideration received from the
purchaser was included in our consolidated statements of financial condition as a financing obligation, and payments made under the lease were recorded as interest expense (at an effective rate of approximately 6%). Depreciation on these fixed
assets was charged to &#147;Occupancy and equipment&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may raise additional funds

operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base,
available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm&#146;s competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides
that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are
able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain
agreements, we may be required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit ratings downgrade. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS </B></P>

security settlements, changes in securities held and marketable securities, and changes in our working capital. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We consider the following
in analyzing changes in our liquidity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A comparison of consolidated net income adjusted for certain non-cash items (e.g., grants of

impact our cash flows in a given period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our investing and funding activities represent a combination of our capital raising activities,
including short-term borrowings and repayments, issuances of shares under our controlled equity offerings (net), Class&nbsp;A common stock repurchases and partnership unit redemptions, purchases and sales of securities, dispositions, and other
investments (e.g. acquisitions, forgivable loans to new brokers and capital expenditures-all net of depreciation and amortization). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our
securities settlement activities primarily represent deposits with clearing organizations. In addition, when advantageous, we may elect to facilitate the settlement of matched principal transactions by funding failed trades, which results in a
temporary secured use of cash and is economically beneficial to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Other changes in working capital represent changes primarily in

from the sale of eSpeed to NASDAQ OMX in June 2013. The net proceeds from the divestiture of eSpeed was approximately $747.7 million. This increase in our liquidity was partially offset by $305.2 million of dividends and distributions paid to our
shareholders and limited partners for the third and fourth quarters of 2012 and the first, second and third quarters of 2013, including distributions in respect of the NASDAQ OMX Transaction. </P>

entered into a clearing capital agreement with Cantor to clear U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities transactions on our behalf. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, so long as Cantor is providing clearing services to us, Cantor
shall be entitled to request from us, and we shall post as soon as practicable, cash or other property acceptable to Cantor in the amount reasonably requested by Cantor under the clearing capital agreement. Cantor had not requested any cash or other

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our liquidity and available cash resources are restricted by regulatory requirements of our operating subsidiaries. Many of these regulators,
including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">cease-and-desist</FONT> orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer. In addition, self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#147;FINRA&#148;) and the National Futures
Association (&#147;NFA&#148;) along with statutory bodies such as the Financial Conduct Authority (&#147;FCA&#148;) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The
requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with broker-dealers and are not designed to specifically protect stockholders. These
regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;page-break-before:always"></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FCA is the relevant statutory regulator in the United Kingdom. The FCA was established in 2013, and superseded the former regulatory
agency, the FSA. The FCA&#146;s objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote competition between financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement
powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition,
the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do business. Additionally, certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain non-U.S. net
capital requirements. In Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC and BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission and The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, respectively. Both are subject to Hong Kong
net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC, BGC France Holdings, and Ginalfi Finance; in Australia, BGC Partners </P>

we anticipate improved derivatives volumes once the international regulatory landscape becomes clearer for the majority of our clients that operate globally. In addition, BGC maintains its ownership stake in ELX, a CFTC-approved designated contract

respect to the issuance and sale of up to 20&nbsp;million shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis. On December&nbsp;12, 2012, we entered into a controlled equity offering sales agreement with
CF&amp;Co (the &#147;December 2012 Sales Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to an aggregate of 20&nbsp;million shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. On February 5, 2015, we completed the sales available under the
December 2012 Sales Agreement. On November 20, 2014, we entered into a controlled equity offering sales agreement with CF&amp;Co (the &#147;November 2014 Sales Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to an aggregate of 20
million shares of our Class A common stock. Shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock sold under our controlled equity offering sales agreement are used primarily for redemptions of limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings. CF&amp;Co is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Cantor and an affiliate of us. Under the December 2012 Sales Agreement and November 2014 Sales Agreement, we have agreed to pay CF&amp;Co 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of February&nbsp;25, 2015, we have issued and sold an aggregate of approximately 0.8 million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock under the
Form S-3 Registration Statement pursuant to the November 2014 Sales Agreement, with approximately 19.2 million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock remaining to be sold under this agreement. We intend to use the net proceeds of any shares of
Class&nbsp;A common stock sold for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions, redemptions of limited partnership units and founding/working partner units in BGC Holdings and repurchases of shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock from
partners, executive officers and other employees of ours or our subsidiaries and of Cantor and its affiliates. Certain of such partners will be expected to use the proceeds from such sales to repay outstanding loans issued by, or credit enhanced by,
Cantor or BGC Holdings. In addition to general corporate purposes, these registrations along with our share buy-back authorization are designed as a planning device in order to facilitate the redemption process. Going forward, we may redeem units
and reduce our fully diluted share count under our repurchase authorization or later sell Class&nbsp;A shares under the registration. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Discretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense is comprised of discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in
cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary
bonuses, actual results may differ. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Restricted Stock Units: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition
provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) guidance. Restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and as per FASB guidance, we are required to record an
expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. FASB guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Because significant assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock.
Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected
dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards&#146; vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a
straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Restricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per FASB guidance, we are
required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance
with our and our affiliates&#146; customary noncompete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in five to ten years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the
grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Limited Partnership Units: Limited partnership units in BGC Holdings are generally held by
employees. Generally such units receive quarterly allocations of net income, which are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As discussed above, our new Preferred Units are
not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. As prescribed in
FASB guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income to such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocation of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and
FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive
post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under FASB guidance. Accordingly, we
recognize a liability for these units on our consolidated statements of financial condition as part of &#147;Accrued compensation&#148; for the amortized portion of the post-termination payment amount, based on the current fair value of the expected
future cash payout. We amortize the post-termination payment amount, less an expected forfeiture rate, over the vesting period, and record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period in our consolidated
statements of operations as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain limited partnership units are granted
exchangeability into Class&nbsp;A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment). At the time exchangeability is granted, we recognize an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in &#147;Allocation
of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred compensation expense, before associated
income taxes, of $126.5 million, $57.0 million and $127.1 million, respectively, related to the grant of exchangeability on partnership units. In addition, during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company redeemed or exchanged limited
partnership units in connection with its Global Partnership Restructuring Program and incurred compensation expense, before associated income taxes of $304.1 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the end of the second quarter of 2013, we commenced a Global Partnership Restructuring Program. As a result of the program, we reduced the
number of BGC Holdings limited partnership units outstanding by approximately 76&nbsp;million units and granted approximately 44&nbsp;million shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock, of which approximately 41&nbsp;million were restricted shares.
Taken together, these actions reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 32&nbsp;million shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Employee Loans: We have
entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited
partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these advances to be repaid in
full from the future distributions on existing and future awards granted. The distributions are treated as compensation expense when made and the proceeds are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation
expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we
recognize a reserve against the loan balances. Actual collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company
commenced a Global Partnership Restructuring Program to provide retention incentives and to allow the Company to take advantage of certain tax efficiencies. Under the program, certain BGC Holdings limited partnership units were redeemed or exchanged
for restricted stock. Due to the net redemption/exchange of the limited partnership units described above, the Company determined that the collectability of a portion of the employee loan balances were not expected and, therefore, the Company
recognized a reserve for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 in the amount of approximately $160.5 million. The compensation expense related to this reserve is included as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits&#148; in the
Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013, the aggregate balance of
employee loans, net of reserve, was $130.8 million and $142.8 million, respectively, and is included as &#147;Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net&#148; in our consolidated statements of financial condition.
Compensation expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $25.7 million, $195 million (including a reserve of $160.5 million recognized, related to the Global Partnership Restructuring
Program) and $35.6 million, respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. </P>

is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in FASB guidance, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically
tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a goodwill
impairment analysis using a two-step process. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first step involves comparing each reporting unit&#146;s estimated fair value with its
carrying value, including goodwill. To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant
estimates and assumptions. These assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because significant assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows,
choosing peer companies and selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to
be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one
indicated a potential impairment may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual
assets, liabilities and identified intangibles. Events such as economic weakness, significant declines in operating results of reporting units, or significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g., estimates of cash flows
or cost of capital) could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Income Taxes </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
account for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in FASB guidance on Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Certain of our entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (&#147;UBT&#148;) in the
City of New York. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners (see Note 3&#151;&#147;Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings&#148; for a discussion of partnership
interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners&#146; tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our consolidated
financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. Pursuant to FASB guidance on Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB
Statement on Accounting for Income Taxes, we provide for uncertain tax positions based upon management&#146;s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to
determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant
assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We recognize interest and
penalties related to income tax matters in &#147;Interest expense&#148; and &#147;Other expenses,&#148; respectively, in our consolidated statement of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax
planning strategies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws
and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because our interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">See Note 4&#151;&#147;Summary of Significant Accounting

</I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit risk arises from potential non-performance by counterparties and customers. BGC Partners has established policies and
procedures to manage its exposure to credit risk. BGC Partners maintains a thorough credit approval process to limit exposure to counterparty risk and employs stringent monitoring to control the counterparty risk from its matched principal and
agency businesses. BGC Partners&#146; account opening and counterparty approval process includes verification of key customer identification, anti-money laundering verification checks and a credit review of financial and operating data. The credit
review process includes establishing an internal credit rating and any other information deemed necessary to make an informed credit decision, which may include correspondence, due diligence calls and a visit to the entity&#146;s premises, as
necessary. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Credit approval is granted subject to certain trading limits and may be subject to additional conditions, such as the receipt
of collateral or other credit support. Ongoing credit monitoring procedures include reviewing periodic financial statements and publicly available information on the client and collecting data from credit rating agencies, where available, to assess
the ongoing financial condition of the client. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Through its subsidiaries, BGC Partners executes matched principal transactions in which it
acts as a &#147;middleman&#148; by serving as counterparty to both a buyer and a seller in matching back-to-back trades. These transactions are then settled through a recognized settlement system or third-party clearing organization. Settlement
typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. BGC Partners generally avoids settlement of principal
transactions on a free-of-payment basis or by physical delivery of the underlying instrument. However, free-of-payment transactions may occur on a very limited basis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The number of matched principal trades BGC Partners executes has continued to grow as compared to prior years. Receivables from
broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers and Payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition primarily
represent the simultaneous purchase and sale of the securities associated with those matched principal transactions that have not settled as of their stated settlement dates. BGC Partners&#146; experience has been that substantially all of these
transactions ultimately settle at the contracted amounts. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, BGC Partners incurs limited credit risk related to certain
brokerage activities. The counterparty risk relates to the collectability of the outstanding brokerage fee receivables. The review process includes monitoring both the clients and the related brokerage receivables. The review includes an evaluation
of the ongoing collection process and an aging analysis of the brokerage receivables. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Market Risk </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses
for a specified position. BGC Partners may allow certain of its desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are primarily for the purpose of
facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, BGC Partners may have market risk exposure on these transactions. BGC Partners&#146; exposure varies based on the size of its
overall positions, the risk characteristics of the instruments held and the amount of time the positions are held before they are disposed of. BGC Partners has limited ability to track its exposure to market risk and unmatched positions on an
intra-day basis; however, it attempts to mitigate its market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging its exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to facilitate customer
transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, BGC Partners may not be able to unwind the position and it may be forced to hold the position for a longer period
than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have investments in marketable equity
securities, which are publicly-traded, and which had a fair value of $144.7 million as of December 31, 2014. Investments in marketable securities carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that the marketable securities will not lose value
and, in general, securities markets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of marketable securities could be materially and adversely affected. We may seek to minimize the effect of price changes
on a portion of our investments in marketable securities through the use of derivative contracts. However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with our investments in
marketable securities. See Note 10&#151;&#147;Marketable Securities&#148; and Note 12&#151;&#147;Derivatives&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding
these investments and related hedging activities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;page-break-before:always"></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our risk
management procedures and strict limits are designed to monitor and limit the risk of unintended loss and have been effective in the past. However, there is no assurance that these procedures and limits will be effective at limiting unanticipated
losses in the future. Adverse movements in the securities positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on
occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on BGC Partners&#146; consolidated financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many
currencies on a daily basis. If any of our data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity,
financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our
control, including cybersecurity incidents, a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also
constrain our ability to expand our businesses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, despite our contingency plans, our ability to conduct business may be
adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or
third parties with whom we conduct business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Foreign Currency Risk </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BGC Partners is exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign currency rates create volatility in the
U.S. dollar equivalent of the Company&#146;s revenues and expenses, in particular with regard to British Pounds and Euros. In addition, changes in the remeasurement of BGC Partners&#146; foreign currency denominated net assets are recorded as part
of its results of operations and fluctuate with changes in foreign currency rates. BGC monitors the net exposure in foreign currencies on a daily basis and hedges its exposure as deemed appropriate with highly rated major financial institutions.

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&nbsp;Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As indicated in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management&#146;s assessment of and conclusion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Cornish and Carey Commercial, which is included in the 2014 consolidated financial statements of BGC Partners, Inc. and constituted $71.7 million or
2.6% of total assets, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and $61.9 million or 3.5% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of BGC Partners, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control
over financial reporting of Cornish and Carey Commercial. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, BGC Partners, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the

million. The earn-out was excluded from the initial gain on the divestiture and will be recognized in income when it is realized and earned, consistent with the accounting guidance for gain contingencies. During each of the years ended
December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, the Company received 992,247 shares of NASDAQ OMX common stock and recognized revenues of $52.8 million and $39.5 million, respectively, related to the earn-out and related hedging transactions which are included in

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Founding/working partners have a limited partnership interest in BGC Holdings. The Company accounts for founding/working partner units
(&#147;FPUs&#148;) outside of permanent capital, as &#147;Redeemable partnership interest,&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. This classification is applicable to founding/working partner units because these
units are redeemable upon termination of a partner, including a termination of employment, which can be at the option of the partner and not within the control of the issuer. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Founding/working partner units are held by limited partners who are employees and generally receive quarterly allocations of net income. Upon
termination of employment or otherwise ceasing to provide substantive services, the founding/working partner units are generally redeemed, and the unit holders are no longer entitled to participate in the quarterly allocations of net income. Since
these allocations of net income are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and are contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder, they are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grant
of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Limited

collectively the &#147;limited partnership units&#148;). Generally, such units receive quarterly allocations of net income, which are cash distributed and generally are contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in
FASB guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grant of exchangeability to limited partnership units and
FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. From time to time the Company issues limited partnership units as part of the consideration for acquisitions. These units are not entitled to a distribution of earnings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount of the units
in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards, and in accordance with FASB guidance, the Company records compensation expense for the
awards based on the change in value at each reporting date in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has also awarded certain preferred partnership units (&#147;Preferred Units&#148;). Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings
are allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation (the &#147;Preferred Distribution&#148;). These allocations are deducted before the
calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in
partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they
are not included in the Company&#146;s fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under &#147;Allocations of net income and grant of exchangeability to limited
partnership units and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining partnership units generally receive quarterly allocations of net income based on their
weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Cantor Units </I></B></P>

one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment); additional limited partnership interests may become exchangeable for Class&nbsp;A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment). Any exchange of limited partnership interests into Class&nbsp;A
common shares would not impact the fully diluted number of shares and units outstanding. Because these limited partnership interests generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, such exchange would have no significant impact on the cash
flows or equity of the Company. Each quarter, net income is allocated between the limited partnership interests and the common stockholders. In quarterly periods in which the Company has a net loss, the loss allocation for FPUs, limited partnership
units and Cantor units is allocated to Cantor and reflected as a component of &#147;Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. In subsequent quarters in which
the Company has net income, the initial allocation of income to the limited partnership interests is to &#147;Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries,&#148; to recover any losses taken in earlier quarters, with the
remaining income allocated to the limited partnership interests. This income (loss) allocation process has no impact on the net income allocated to common stockholders. </P>

customers. Revenues earned from principal transactions represent the spread between the buy and sell price of the brokered security, commodity or derivative. Principal transaction revenues and related expenses are recognized on a trade-date basis.

fees are recognized at the time the related services have been performed, unless future contingencies exist. In addition, in regard to management and facility service contracts, the owner of the property will typically reimburse the Company for
certain expenses that are incurred on behalf of the owner, which are comprised primarily of on-site employee salaries and related benefit costs. The amounts which are to be reimbursed per the terms of the services contract are recognized as revenue
in the same period as the related expenses are incurred. In certain instances, the Company subcontracts property management services to independent property managers, in which case the Company passes a portion of their property management fee on to
the subcontractor, and the Company retains the balance. Accordingly, the Company records these fees net of the amounts paid to subcontractors. </P>

classified within Level 1 or Level 2. The types of instruments generally classified within Level 1 include most U.S. government securities, certain sovereign government obligations, and active listed equities. The Company does not adjust the quoted
price for such instruments. The types of instruments generally classified within Level 2 include agency securities, most investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, certain sovereign government obligations, money market securities, and less

exchange-traded or OTC. Exchange-traded derivatives typically fall within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether they are deemed to be actively traded or not. The Company generally values exchange-traded derivatives
using the closing price of the exchange-traded derivatives. OTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing
sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management
judgment. Such instruments are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">See Note 13&#151;&#147;Fair Value of

either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on some or all of their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of time. The forgivable portion of these loans is recognized as
compensation expense over the life of the loan. From time to time, the Company may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the
timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. The Company reviews the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If the Company determines that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, the Company

over three to five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated economic useful lives or the remaining lease term. Routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When fixed assets are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the related gain or loss is included in operating income. The Company has asset retirement obligations related to certain of its leasehold improvements, which it accounts for using the FASB guidance, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement cost
is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The liability is discounted and accretion expense is recognized using the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate in effect when the liability was initially recognized. </P>

assessing whether the unamortized carrying amount can be recovered over the remaining life through undiscounted future expected cash flows generated by the underlying assets. If the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying value of

assets for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. When reviewing goodwill for
impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company performed impairment evaluations for the years ended

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain
of the Company&#146;s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (&#147;UBT&#148;) in New York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT
rests with the partners (see Note 3&#151;&#147;Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings&#148; for a discussion of partnership interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners&#146; tax liability or benefit is not reflected
in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as
corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. Pursuant to FASB guidance on Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement on Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company provides for uncertain tax
positions based upon management&#146;s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in &#147;Interest
expense&#148; and &#147;Other expenses,&#148; respectively, in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company
files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various states, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to United States federal, and non-U.S. income tax examination by tax authorities for the years
prior to 2011, and no longer subject to state and local income tax examination by tax authorities for the years prior to 2009. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Equity-Based and Other

Equity-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of equity-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest. The grant-date fair value of equity-based awards is amortized to expense ratably
over the awards&#146; vesting periods. As equity-based compensation expense recognized in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reviewed for estimated forfeitures.
Further, FASB guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. </P>

guidance, the Company is required to record an expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. The grant-date fair value of RSUs is amortized to expense ratably over the awards&#146; vesting periods. The amortization is
reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Restricted

guidance, the Company is required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. The Company has granted restricted stock that is fully vested and not subject to continued employment or service with
the Company or any affiliate or subsidiary of the Company; however, transferability is subject to compliance with BGC Partners&#146; and its affiliates&#146; customary noncompete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by
partners in five to ten years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based
compensation expense in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Limited Partnership Units: </I></B></P>

requirements to be accounted for as an equity instrument, and the Company classifies the conversion feature within &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. At the issuance of the
4.50% Convertible Notes, the embedded conversion feature was measured at approximately $19.0 million on a pre-tax basis ($16.1 million net of taxes and issuance costs) as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of a similar

attributable to Cantor is included as part of &#147;Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. In the U.S., the Company provides Cantor with technology

established a fully electronic futures exchange. Prior to consolidating ELX, the Company accounted for ELX under the equity method of accounting (see Note&nbsp;15&#151;&#147;Investments&#148; for more details). Effective December&nbsp;23, 2014, the
Company consolidated ELX in its consolidated financial statements. The Company has entered into a technology services agreement with ELX pursuant to which the Company provided software technology licenses, monthly maintenance support and other
technology services as requested by ELX. As part of the sale of eSpeed, the Company sold the technology services agreement with ELX to NASDAQ OMX. In addition, in connection with the sale of eSpeed (see Note 2&#151;&#147;Divestiture&#148;), the

years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company was charged $34.3 million, $32.7 million and $35.3 million, respectively, for the services provided by Cantor and its affiliates, of which $22.2 million, $23.3 million and $23.5 million,
respectively, were to cover compensation to leased employees for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The fees paid to Cantor for administrative and support services, other than those to cover the compensation costs of leased

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of the 8.75% Convertible Notes was estimated based on a jump-diffusion convertible pricing
model, which among other inputs incorporates the scheduled coupon and principal payments, the conversion feature inherent in the 8.75% Convertible Notes, the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock price and a stock price volatility assumption. The
stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historic volatility of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. The fair value measurements of the 8.75% Convertible Notes are based on significant inputs observable in the market and are
considered Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the Senior Notes and 4.50% Convertible Notes were determined using observable market prices as these securities are traded and are considered Level 1 and Level 2, respectively,
within the fair value hierarchy, based on whether they are deemed to be actively traded. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Convertible Notes </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;1, 2010, BGC Holdings issued an aggregate of $150.0 million principal amount of the 8.75% Convertible Notes to Cantor in a
private placement transaction. The Company used the proceeds of the 8.75% Convertible Notes to repay $150.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes that matured on April&nbsp;1, 2010. The 8.75% Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations and
rank equally and ratably with all existing and future senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 8.75% Convertible Notes bear an annual interest rate of 8.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on April&nbsp;15 and October&nbsp;15 of each year,
beginning on October&nbsp;15, 2010, and were convertible into 24.0&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. The 8.75% Convertible Notes will mature on April&nbsp;15, 2015, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged
or converted. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 8.75% Convertible Notes of $13.1&nbsp;million for each year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the 8.75% Convertible Notes were convertible, at the holder&#146;s option, at a conversion rate of 159.9374
shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to customary adjustments upon certain corporate events, including stock dividends and stock splits on the Class&nbsp;A common stock and the Company&#146;s payment of a
quarterly cash dividend in excess of $0.10 per share of Class&nbsp;A common stock. The conversion rate will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest to the conversion date. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;29, 2011, the Company issued an aggregate of $160.0 million principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016. The
4.50% Convertible Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 4.50% Convertible Notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.50%&nbsp;per annum and were priced at par. The 4.50% Convertible Notes will mature on July&nbsp;15,
2016, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or converted. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 4.50% Convertible Notes of $11.9 million, $11.7 million and $11.6 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the 4.50% Convertible Notes were convertible, at the holder&#146;s
option, at a conversion rate of 101.6260 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including stock dividends and stock splits on the Class&nbsp;A common stock and the
Company&#146;s payment of a quarterly cash dividend in excess of $0.17 per share of Class&nbsp;A common stock. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, or a combination thereof at
the Company&#146;s election. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the 4.50% Convertible Notes were convertible into approximately 16.3&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As prescribed by FASB guidance, Debt, the Company recognized the value of the embedded conversion feature of the 4.50% Convertible Notes as an
increase to &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; of approximately $19.0 million on a pre-tax basis ($16.1 million net of taxes and issuance costs). The embedded conversion feature was measured as the difference between the proceeds received and
the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion feature. The value of the conversion feature is treated as a debt discount and reduced the initial carrying value of the 4.50% Convertible Notes to $137.2 million, net of debt issuance
costs of $3.8 million allocated to the debt component of the instrument. The discount is amortized as interest cost and the carrying value of the 4.50% Convertible Notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the 4.50% Convertible
Notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the offering of the 4.50% Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions, which are
expected to reduce the potential dilution of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock upon any conversion of the 4.50% Convertible Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, as measured
under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions ($10.62 as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The capped call transactions had an initial cap
price equal to $12.30 per share (50% above the last reported sale price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock on the NASDAQ on July&nbsp;25, 2011), and had a cap price equal to approximately $13.27 per share as of December&nbsp;31, 2014.
The purchase price of the capped call transactions resulted in a decrease to &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; of $11.4 million on a pre-tax basis ($9.9 million on an after-tax basis). The capped call transactions cover approximately
15.1&nbsp;million shares of BGC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The fair value of RSUs awarded to employees and directors is determined on the date of grant based on the
market value of Class&nbsp;A common stock (adjusted if appropriate based upon the award&#146;s eligibility to receive dividends), and is recognized, net of the effect of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period. The Company uses
historical data, including historical forfeitures and turnover rates, to estimate expected forfeiture rates for both employee and director RSUs. Each RSU is settled in one share of Class&nbsp;A common stock upon completion of the vesting period.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company granted 1.0&nbsp;million, 1.5&nbsp;million and
1.7&nbsp;million, respectively, of RSUs with aggregate estimated grant date fair values of approximately $5.8 million, $4.9 million and $9.1 million, respectively, to employees and directors. These RSUs were awarded in lieu of cash compensation for
salaries, commissions and/or discretionary or guaranteed bonuses. RSUs granted to these individuals generally vest over a two- to four-year period. </P>

million and $2.3 million, respectively, to pay taxes due at the time of vesting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, the aggregate

related to RSUs, before associated income taxes, was approximately $4.6 million, $5.8 million and $7.8 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, there was approximately $9.7

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the end of the second quarter of 2013, pursuant to the Global Partnership Restructuring Program the Company granted approximately
44&nbsp;million shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, of which approximately 41&nbsp;million were restricted shares. Transferability of the shares of restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service with the
Company or any affiliate or subsidiary of the Company; however, transferability is subject to compliance with BGC Partners&#146; and its affiliates&#146; customary noncompete obligations. Because the restricted stock was not subject to continued
employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock was expensed on the date of grant. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company incurred non-cash, non-dilutive compensation charges of $304.1 million related to
the redemption/exchange of partnership units and issuance of restricted shares, which was included in &#147;Allocation of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated
statements of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The restricted shares are generally saleable by partners in five to ten years. Partners who agree to extend the
lengths of their employment agreements and/or other contractual modifications sought by the Company are expected to be able to sell their restricted shares over a shorter time period. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, the
Company released the restrictions with respect to approximately 11.8&nbsp;million and 5.9&nbsp;million of such shares, respectively. </P>

New York against BGC Financial, L.P. (&#147;BGC Financial&#148;), an affiliate of BGC Partners, one of BGC Financial&#146;s officers, and certain persons formerly or currently employed by Tullett Liberty subsidiaries. Tullett Liberty thereafter
added Tullett Prebon Americas Corp. (&#147;Tullett Americas,&#148; together with Tullett Liberty, the &#147;Tullett Subsidiaries&#148;) as a claimant, and added 35 individual employees, who were formerly employed by the Tullett Subsidiaries, as
respondents. In the arbitration, the Tullett Subsidiaries alleged, among other things, that BGC Financial harmed their inter-dealer brokerage business by hiring 79 of their employees, and that BGC Financial aided and abetted various alleged wrongs
by the employees, engaged in unfair competition, misappropriated trade secrets and confidential information, tortiously interfered with contract and economic relationships, and violated FINRA Rules of Conduct. The parties stipulated to consolidate
the arbitration with five other related arbitrations (FINRA Case Nos. 09-04807, 09-04842, 09-06377, 10-00139 and 10-01265), and FINRA consolidated them. In addition, Tullett filed an action in the Supreme Court, New York County against three of
BGC&#146;s executives involved in the recruitment in the New York metropolitan area, but later agreed to discontinue the action in New York state court and add these claims to the arbitration. Tullett and the Company also agreed to join
Tullett&#146;s claims against BGC Capital Markets, L.P. (&#147;BGC Capital Markets&#148;) to the arbitration. The parties and FINRA also agreed to consolidate an eighth arbitration filed against the Tullett Subsidiaries by certain of its former

their contract with the people who sold them Chapdelaine Corporate Securities&nbsp;&amp; Co. (many of whom now work for BGC) and were ordered to pay those individuals over $6 million in damages. The Tullett Subsidiaries were also found to have
wrongly refused to pay compensation and expenses to one of their former employees who now works for BGC, who was awarded over $222,000. BGC Financial and BGC Capital Markets (the &#147;BGC Respondents&#148;) were found solely liable for

some additional pleading and motion practice, on June&nbsp;18, 2010, the District Court ordered that the New Jersey Action be dismissed with prejudice, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Judicial Circuit affirmed. Subsequently, Tullett,

expense and the August 2011 amendment to the change in control agreement of Mr.&nbsp;Lutnick was unfair to the Company. It sought to recover for the Company unquantified damages, disgorgement of payments received by defendants, a declaration that

Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 based upon criteria set forth in the Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)
(COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on the results of our 2014 evaluation, our management concluded that

2014, and did not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in 2014. However, we anticipate that this acquisition will be included in management&#146;s assessment of internal control over financial
reporting and our audit of internal controls over financial reporting for 2015. The aggregate 2014 GAAP revenues, recognized by Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey Commercial since the acquisition, represented approximately 3.5% or $61.9&nbsp;million of the
Company&#146;s total GAAP revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The effectiveness of our internal control over financial

acceleration of deferred financing costs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because the leases were terminated during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company
had no outstanding balance or fixed assets related to the leases as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 nor December 31, 2014. The Company recorded interest expense of $0.7 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because assets reverted back to the BGC Partners, Inc. and subsidiaries at the end of the leases, the transactions were
capitalized. As a result, consideration received from the purchaser was included in the BGC Partners, Inc. consolidated balance sheet as a financing obligation, and payments made under the lease were recorded as interest expense (at an effective
rate of approximately 6%). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;page-break-before:always"></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July&nbsp;29, 2011, the Company
issued an aggregate of $160.0 million principal amount 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016 (the &#147;4.50% Convertible Notes&#148;). The 4.50% Convertible Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of BGC Partners, Inc. The 4.50%
Convertible Notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.50%&nbsp;per annum and were priced at par. The 4.50% Convertible Notes will mature on July&nbsp;15, 2016, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or converted. The Company recorded interest

including stock dividends and stock splits on the Class&nbsp;A common stock and the Company&#146;s payment of a quarterly cash dividend in excess of $0.17 per share of Class&nbsp;A common stock.
Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, or a combination thereof at the Company&#146;s election. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the 4.50% Convertible Notes were convertible into
approximately 16.3&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As prescribed by FASB guidance, Debt, the Company recognized the
value of the embedded conversion feature as an increase to additional paid-in capital of approximately $19.0 million on a pre-tax basis ($16.1 million net of taxes and issuance costs). The embedded conversion feature was measured as the difference
between the proceeds received and the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion feature. The value of the conversion feature is treated as a debt discount and reduced the initial carrying value of the 4.50% Convertible Notes to $137.2
million, net of debt issuance costs of $3.8 million allocated to the debt component of the instrument. The discount is amortized as interest cost and the carrying value of the notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the notes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the offering of the 4.50% Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions, which are expected to
reduce the potential dilution of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock upon any conversion of the 4.50% Convertible Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, as measured under the
terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions ($10.62 as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances). The capped call transactions had an initial cap price
equal to $12.30 per share (50% above the last reported sale price of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock on the NASDAQ on July&nbsp;25, 2011), and had a cap price equal to approximately $13.27 per share as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. The
purchase price of the capped call resulted in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $11.4 million on a pre-tax basis ($9.9 million on an after-tax basis). The capped call transactions cover approximately 15.1 million shares of BGC&#146;s
Class&nbsp;A common stock as of December 31, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;26, 2012, the Company issued an aggregate of $112.5 million principal

unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date. The 8.125% Senior Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#147;BGCA.&#148; The Company used the proceeds to repay short-term

interest rate payable on the notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time based on the debt rating assigned by specified rating agencies to the notes, as set forth in the Indenture. The 5.375% Senior Notes will mature on December 9, 2019.
The Company may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time for cash at certain &#147;make-whole&#148; redemption prices (as set forth in the Indenture). If a &#147;Change of Control Triggering Event&#148; (as defined in the
Indenture) occurs, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
purchase date. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The initial carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes was $295.1 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs of
