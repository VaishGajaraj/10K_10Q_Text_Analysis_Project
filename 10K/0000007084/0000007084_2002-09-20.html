<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;The need to successfully market new or improved food and feed ingredients developed in the Company's research laboratories led to the concept of technical support. The Company is staffed with technical representatives who work closely with customers and potential customers on the development of food and feed products which incorporate Company-produced ingredients. These technical representatives are an adjunct to both the research and sales functions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;The Company maintains a research laboratory in Decatur, Illinois where product and process development activities are conducted. To develop new bioproducts and to improve existing bioproducts, new cultures are developed using classical mutation and genetic engineering. Protein and vegetable oil research is conducted at facilities in Decatur where bakery, meat and dairy pilot plants support application research. Research to support sales and development for bakery products is done at a laboratory in Olathe, Kansas. Research to support sales and development for cocoa and chocolate products is done in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the Netherlands. Research and technical support for industrial and food wheat starch applications is conducted in a Montreal, Canada research center. The Company maintains research centers in Quincy, Illinois and Decatur, Indiana that conduct swine and cattle feeding trials to test new formula feed products and to develop improved feeding efficiencies.</P>

<FONT FACE="CG Times"><P>Item 3.&#9;LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</P><DIR>

</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1993, the State of Illinois Environmental Protection Agency ("Illinois EPA") brought administrative enforcement proceedings arising out of the Company's alleged failure to obtain proper permits for certain pollution control equipment at one of the Company's processing facilities in Illinois. In 1998, the Illinois EPA filed an administrative enforcement proceeding arising out of certain alleged permit exceedances relating to the same facility. Also, in 1998 the Company voluntarily reported to the Illinois EPA certain other permit exceedances related to other processes at that same facility, and in 1999 Illinois EPA issued a Notice of Violation relating to those exceedances. In 2000, the Company voluntarily disclosed certain other permit exceedances at the same facility. In 1998, the State of Illinois filed a civil administrative action against the Company alleging violations of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, and regulations promulgated thereunder, arising from a one-time release of denatured ethanol at one of the Company's Illinois distribution facilities. The Company is in discussions with the Illinois EPA to settle all of the pending matters with the State. In January 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("U.S. EPA") issued a Notice of Violation to the Company for another Illinois facility regarding alleged emissions violations and the failure to obtain proper permits for various equipment at that facility. That matter has been referred to the Department of Justice ("DOJ"), and the Company has met with the U.S. EPA and DOJ regarding settlement of that matter. In management's opinion, the settlement of these proceedings, all seeking compliance with applicable environmental permits and regulations, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is involved in approximately 25 administrative and judicial proceedings in which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") under the federal Superfund law and its state analogs for the study and clean-up of sites contaminated by material discharged into the environment. In all of these matters, there are numerous PRPs. Due to various factors such as the required level of remediation and participation in the clean-up effort by others, the Company's future clean-up costs at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated. In management's opinion, these proceedings will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LITIGATION REGARDING ALLEGED ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is currently a defendant in various lawsuits related to alleged anticompetitive practices by the Company as described in more detail below. The Company intends to vigorously defend these actions unless they can be settled on terms deemed acceptable to the parties. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GOVERNMENTAL MATTERS</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Federal grand juries in the Northern Districts of Illinois, California and Georgia, under the direction of the DOJ, have been investigating possible violations by the Company and others with respect to the sale of lysine, citric acid and high fructose corn syrup, respectively. In connection with an agreement with the DOJ in fiscal 1997, the Company paid the United States fines of $100 million. This agreement constituted a global resolution of all matters between the DOJ and the Company and brought to a close all DOJ investigations of the Company. The federal grand juries in the Northern Districts of Illinois (lysine) and Georgia (high fructose corn syrup) have been closed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;The Company has received notice that certain foreign governmental entities were commencing investigations to determine whether anticompetitive practices occurred in their jurisdictions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;below, all such matters have been resolved as previously reported. In June 1997, the Company and several of its European subsidiaries were notified that the Commission of the European Communities had initiated an investigation as to possible anticompetitive practices in the amino acid markets, in particular the lysine market, in the European Union. On October 29, 1998, the Commission of the European Communities initiated formal proceedings against the Company and others and adopted a Statement of Objections. The reply of the Company was filed on February 1, 1999 and the hearing was held on March 1, 1999. On August 8, 1999, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a supplementary Statement of Objections expanding the period of involvement as to certain other companies. On June 7, 2000, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a decision imposing a fine against the Company in the amount of EUR 47.3 million. The Company has appealed this decision. In September 1997, the Company received a request for information from the Commission of the European Communities with respect to an investigation being conducted by that Commission into the possible existence of certain agreements and/or concerted practices in the citric acid market in the European Union. On March 28, 2000, the Commission of European Communities initiated formal proceedings against the Company and others and adopted a Statement of Objections. The reply of the Company was filed on June 9, 2000. On December 17, 2001, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a decision imposing a fine against the Company in the amount of EUR 39.69 million. The Company has appealed this decision. In November 1998, a European subsidiary of the Company received a request for information from the Commission of the European Communities with respect to an investigation being conducted by that Commission into the possible existence of certain agreements and/or concerted practices in the sodium gluconate market in the European Union. On May 17, 2000, the Commission of European Communities initiated formal proceedings against the Company and others and adopted a Statement of Objections. The reply of Company was filed on September 1, 2000. On October 2, 2001, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a decision imposing a fine against the Company in the amount of EUR 10.3 million. The Company has appealed this decision. On May 8, 2000, a Brazilian subsidiary of the Company was notified of the commencement of an administrative proceeding by the Department of Protection and Economic Defense relative to possible anticompetitive practices in the lysine market in Brazil. On July 3, 2000, the Brazilian subsidiary of the Company filed a Statement of Defense in this proceeding. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ultimate outcome of the proceedings of the Commission of the European Communities and the ultimate outcome and materiality of the proceedings of the Brazilian Department of Protection and Economic Defense cannot presently be determined.
