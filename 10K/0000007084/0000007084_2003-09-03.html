<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Since the Company's customers are principally other manufacturers and processors, its products are distributed mainly in bulk from processing plants or storage facilities directly to the customers' facilities.  The Company has developed a comprehensive transportation system utilizing trucks, rail, river barges and ocean-going vessels to efficiently move both commodities and processed products virtually anywhere in the world.

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company continues to expand its business through the development and production of new, value-added products.  A new line of trans-free fats and oils has been developed under the NovaLipid&trade; brand using enzymatic interesterification technology.  This portfolio of new products will allow margarines, shortenings and other products to be produced with near zero levels of trans-fatty acids.  This enzymatic interesterification technology has been used for over a year to supply the Company's cocoa operations with cocoa butter substitutes and the Company has been supplying external customers with these products.  This same process has been scaled up for trans-free fats and oils and is being tested by our customers for use in trans-free margarines, and bakery products in response to recent FDA trans-fatty acid labeling regulations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;The Company introduced a new product for latex paint manufacturers, Archer RC<FONT SIZE=1>&reg;</FONT>, that reduces the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released as latex paint dries.  During the drying process in a conventional latex paint, coalescing solvents soften the paint resin so that it will form a film.  These solvents then evaporate into the atmosphere as VOCs.  The new Archer RC<FONT SIZE=1>&reg;</FONT> works in a similar way, except that it becomes part of the film instead of evaporating, producing coatings with higher scrub resistance and gloss while greatly reducing or eliminating VOCs.  Archer RC<FONT SIZE=1>&reg;</FONT> is derived from vegetable oil, a renewable resource, and will replace a petroleum-based solvent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;Other new products include a wide-range of health and nutrition products known as nutraceuticals or functional foods.  The Company acquired an exclusive license for flax lignan technology that may have potential for health maintenance and possible risk reduction of several diseases.  The license gives the Company an exclusive, worldwide right to produce and sell flax lignans for use as an active ingredient in functional foods, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, animal feed additives and veterinary products.  Pilot scale quantities of this product have been produced to support clinical trials of this product.  The Company is a leader in the processing of flaxseed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;The Company has formed a joint venture with Kao Corporation of Japan to manufacture and market diacylglycerol oil in America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  This oil, developed by Kao, has been shown in several clinical studies in Japan to assist in lowering body fat content.  This naturally derived vegetable oil can be used as a home cooking oil or as an ingredient in packaged foods.  Semi-works scale production of this product has begun and is supplying test markets in Chicago and Atlanta.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company continues to develop its soy protein meat substitutes.  New product research in the area include new extrusion processes for the development of meat substitutes.  &#9;The Company also introduced a new organic soy protein ingredient, Nutrisoy<FONT SIZE=1>&reg;</FONT> whole soybean soymilk powder.  This product differs from traditional soymilks in that the fiber component of the soybean is retained in the soymilk.  In the nutraceutical area, work continues on expanding the use of isoflavones into more food formulations.</P>

There is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of the Company's principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa beans and other grains.  However, the actual physical movement of the millions of bushels of these crops through the Company's storage and processing facilities is reasonably constant throughout the year. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;During 2003, $50.9 million was spent for equipment, facilities and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with federal, state and local laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;&#9;&#9;In April 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with the federal and various state and county governments to reduce air emissions over the next 10 years.  This agreement relates to 52 facilities located in 16 states and resolves all air emissions issues at these facilities.  The Company anticipates achieving a portion of these reductions through process changes and optimization of existing pollution control equipment.  However, in the event the Company were to effect these emission reductions solely by installation of additional control equipment, the capital cost during the 10-year period is estimated to be $213 million.  The Company expects other expenditures for environmental facilities and programs to continue at approximately the present rate with no unusual amounts anticipated for the next two years.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is involved in approximately 25 administrative and judicial proceedings in which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party (&quot;PRP&quot;) under the federal Superfund law and its state analogs for the study and clean-up of sites contaminated by material discharged into the environment.  In all of these matters, there are numerous PRPs.  Due to various factors such as the required level of remediation and participation in the clean-up effort by others, the Company's future clean-up costs at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated.  In management's opinion, these proceedings will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LITIGATION REGARDING ALLEGED ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is currently a defendant in various lawsuits related to alleged anticompetitive practices by the Company as described in more detail below.  The Company intends to vigorously defend these actions unless they can be settled on terms deemed acceptable to the parties. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">GOVERNMENTAL MATTERS</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Federal grand juries in the Northern Districts of Illinois, California and Georgia, under the direction of the United States Department of Justice (&quot;DOJ&quot;), have been investigating possible violations by the Company and others with respect to the sale of lysine, citric acid and high fructose corn syrup, respectively. In connection with an agreement with the DOJ in fiscal 1997, the Company paid the United States fines of $100 million. This agreement constituted a global resolution of all matters between the DOJ and the Company and brought to a close all DOJ investigations of the Company. The federal grand juries in the Northern Districts of Illinois (lysine) and Georgia (high fructose corn syrup) have been closed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company has received notice that certain foreign governmental entities were commencing investigations to determine whether anticompetitive practices occurred in their jurisdictions. Except for the investigations being conducted by the Commission of the European Communities and the Brazilian Department of Protection and Economic Defense as described below, all such matters have been resolved as previously reported.  In June 1997, the Company and several of its European subsidiaries were notified that the Commission of the European Communities had initiated an investigation as to possible anticompetitive practices in the amino acid markets, in particular the lysine market, in the European Union. On October 29, 1998, the Commission of the European Communities initiated formal proceedings against the Company and others and adopted a Statement of Objections.  The reply of the Company was filed on February 1, 1999 and the hearing was held on March 1, 1999.  On August 8, 1999, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a supplementary Statement of Objections expanding the period of involvement as to certain other companies.  On June 7, 2000, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a decision imposing a fine against the Company in the amount of EUR 47.3 million.  The Company appealed this decision.  On July 9, 2003 the court reduced the fine assessed against the Company to EUR 43.9 million.  The Company is considering a further appeal of this decision.  In September 1997, the Company received a request for information from the Commission of the European Communities with respect to an investigation being conducted by that Commission into the possible existence of certain agreements and/or concerted practices in the citric acid market in the European Union.  On March 28, 2000, the Commission of the European Communities initiated formal proceedings against the Company and others and adopted a Statement of Objections.  The reply of the Company was filed on June 9, 2000.  On December 17, 2001, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a decision imposing a fine against the Company in the amount of EUR 39.7 million.  The Company has appealed this decision.  In November 1998, a European subsidiary of the Company received a request for information from the Commission of the European Communities with respect to an investigation being conducted by that Commission into the possible existence of certain agreements and/or concerted practices in the sodium gluconate market in the European Union.  On May 17, 2000, the Commission of the European Communities initiated formal proceedings against the Company and others and adopted a Statement of Objections.  The reply of the Company was filed on September 1, 2000.  On October 2, 2001, the Commission of the European Communities adopted a decision imposing a fine against the Company in the amount of EUR 10.3 million.  The Company has appealed this decision.  On May 8, 2000, a Brazilian subsidiary of the Company was notified of the commencement of an administrative proceeding by the Department of Protection and Economic Defense relative to possible anticompetitive practices in the lysine market in Brazil.  On July 3, 2000, the Brazilian subsidiary of the Company filed a Statement of Defense in this proceeding.  </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP ACTIONS</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company, along with other companies, has been named as a defendant in thirty-one antitrust suits involving the sale of high fructose corn syrup in the United States.  Thirty of these actions have been brought as putative class actions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FEDERAL ACTIONS.  Twenty-two of these putative class actions allege violations of federal antitrust laws, including allegations that the defendants agreed to fix, stabilize and maintain at artificially high levels the prices of high fructose corn syrup, and seek injunctions against continued alleged illegal conduct, treble damages of an unspecified amount, attorneys' fees and costs, and other unspecified relief. The putative classes in these cases comprise certain direct purchasers of high fructose corn syrup during certain periods in the 1990s. These twenty-two actions have been transferred to the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois and consolidated under the caption In Re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 1087 and Master File No. 95-1477.  On April 3, 2001, the Company and the other defendants filed motions for summary judgment. On August 23, 2001, the Court entered a written order granting the defendants' motions for summary judgment.  On June 18, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment for defendants.  On August 5, 2002, the Court of Appeals denied defendants' petitions for rehearing and rehearing en banc.  On February 24, 2003, the United States Supreme Court denied defendants' petitions for writ of certiorari.  On July 1, 2003, the Company and the other defendants filed a motion to decertify the class.  That motion is currently being briefed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On January 14, 1997, the Company, along with other companies, was named a defendant in a non-class action antitrust suit involving the sale of high fructose corn syrup and corn syrup. This action which is encaptioned Gray &amp; Co. v. Archer Daniels Midland Co., et al., No. 97-69-AS, was filed in federal court in Oregon, alleges violations of federal antitrust laws and Oregon and Michigan state antitrust laws, including allegations that the defendants conspired to fix, raise, maintain and stabilize the price of corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup, and seeks treble damages, attorneys' fees and costs of an unspecified amount. This action was transferred for pretrial proceedings to the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois.  On October 25, 2002, the defendants moved for partial summary judgment with respect to the corn syrup claims asserted in this case.  On May 13, 2003, the Court denied this motion.  On June 24, 2003, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation remanded the case back to federal court in Oregon.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">STATE ACTIONS.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE ACTIONS</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company, along with other companies, has been named as a defendant in sixteen putative class action antitrust suits and one non-class action suit involving the sale of monosodium glutamate and/or other food flavor enhancers in the United States and three putative class action antitrust suits involving the sale of nucleotides and monosodium glutamate in Canada.  Except for the actions specifically described below, all such suits have been settled, dismissed or withdrawn.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CANADIAN ACTIONS. The Company, along with other companies, has been named as a defendant in three actions filed pursuant to the Class Proceedings Act in which the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated the Competition Act with respect to the sale of nucleotides and monosodium glutamate in Canada.  The putative classes are comprised of direct and indirect purchasers in Canada during the period from January 1, 1990 to November 1, 1999.  The plaintiffs in these actions seek general, punitive and exemplary damages and &quot;disgorgement of ill-gotten overcharges&quot;, plus prejudgment interest and costs of the actions.   The first action was filed on or about September 7, 2001 in the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto, Ontario, and is encaptioned Long Duc Ngo and Christopher McLean v. Ajinomoto U.S.A., Inc., et al., Court File No. 37708.  The second action was filed on or about October 4, 2001 in the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver and is encaptioned Abel Lam and Klas Consulting &amp; Investment Ltd. v.

Inc., et al., No.:  200-06-000019-011.  On September 19, 2002, the plaintiffs in the Ontario class action served a motion seeking to amend the Statement of Claim to remove all allegations relating to the sale of nucleotides and to launch a separate class action in respect of the sale of nucleotides.  On December 10, 2002, the plaintiffs withdrew this motion and advised that they no longer intend to sever the MSG and nucleotides claims.  The plaintiffs further advised on December 10, 2002 that they would be serving a further Amended Statement of Claim, but no such pleading has yet been served.  The original timetable approved by the Court for the conduct of the motion for certification in Ontario has been abandoned and no new timetable has been set.  No schedule has been established for the actions pending in British Columbia and Quebec.  Plaintiffs' counsel has advised that the plaintiffs have now reached a settlement with certain, as yet unnamed, defendant(s) in all three actions.  The plaintiffs' motion for approval of this settlement, scheduled for June 2, 2003 in the Ontario Superior Court, has been tentatively adjourned to October 7, 2003.  On May 28, 2003, the Company and the plaintiffs in these three actions reached an agreement pursuant to which the Company will pay the plaintiffs C$150,000, plus up to C$25,000 in costs related to providing notice of this settlement.

The Company, along with other defendants, also has been named as a defendant in one non-class action antitrust suit filed by six individual business entities in Kansas state court involving the sale of monosodium glutamate and nucleotides.  The action alleges violations of the Kansas state antitrust laws, including allegations that defendants agreed to raise, fix and maintain prices for monosodium glutamate and nucleotides, and seeks damages, including treble damages and the full consideration or sum paid for monosodium glutamate or nucleotides or products containing these ingredients, of an unspecified amount, attorneys' fees and costs, and other unspecified relief.  This action was filed on October 8, 2002 in the District Court of Wyandotte County, Kansas and is encaptioned Four B Corp., et al., v. Archer Daniels Midland Co., et al., Civil Action No. 02-C-4271.  On January 3, 2003, the Company along with other defendants removed this action to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas.  On February 12, 2003, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the District of Minnesota for coordinated pretrial proceedings.  On April 3, 2003, the Company moved to dismiss the case.  This motion is currently pending.  The Company, along with other defendants, also has been named as a defendant in one putative class action antitrust suit filed in Wisconsin state court involving the sale of monosodium glutamate and nucleotides.  The action alleges violations of the laws of the States of Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  The action includes allegations that the defendants agreed to fix, stabilize, control and maintain the prices for monosodium glutamate and nucleotides, and seeks damages, including treble damages, of an unspecified amount, attorneys' fees and costs, and other unspecified relief.  The putative class in this action comprises all persons or entities in the above-referenced jurisdictions who indirectly purchased monosodium glutamate or nucleotides, or products containing these ingredients for human and/or animal consumption, during any time between January 1, 1989 and November 25, 2002.  This action was filed on November 25, 2002 in the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin and is encaptioned Lief v. Archer Daniels Midland Co., et al., Case No. 02-CV-3697.  On March 12, 2003, the Company and other defendants removed this action to the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.  On April 11, 2003, plaintiffs moved to remand this case to state court.  On May 6, 2003, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred this action to the District of Minnesota for coordinated pretrial proceedings.</P>
