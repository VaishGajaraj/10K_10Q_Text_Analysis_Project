SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

     Certain statements contained in this Form 10-K and accompanying 2003 Annual
Report, as well as other information provided from time to time by the Company
or its employees, may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in
the forward looking statements. The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate,"
"expect," "think," "should" and "objective" or similar expressions are intended
to identify forward looking statements. The forward looking statements are based
on the Company's then current views and assumptions and involve risks and
uncertainties that include, among other things:

     - the continued shift in the Company's business from lower cost, local-read
       meters towards more expensive, value-added automatic meter reading (AMR)
       systems;

     - the success or failure of new Company products, including the Orion radio
       frequency drive-by AMR meter, the advanced digital encoder (ADE) and the
       proposed Galaxy fixed base AMR system;

     - changes in competitive pricing and bids in the marketplace, and
       particularly continued intense price competition on government bid
       contracts for lower cost, local read meters;

     - the actions (or lack thereof) of the Company's competitors;

     - the Company's relationships with its alliance partners, particularly its
       alliance partners that provide AMR connectivity solutions;

     - the general health of the United States economy, particularly including
       housing starts and the overall industrial activity;

     - changes in foreign economic conditions, including currency fluctuations
       such as the recent increase in the euro versus the United States dollar;

     - changes in laws and regulations, particularly laws dealing with the use
       of lead (which can be used in the manufacture of certain meters
       incorporating brass housings) and Federal Communications Commission rules
       affecting the use and/or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for AMR
       products; and

     - increases in the cost and/or availability of needed raw materials and
       parts, including recent increases in the cost of brass housings as a
       result of increases in the commodity prices for copper and zinc at the
       supplier level.

     Some or all of these factors are beyond the Company's control.
Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these
factors carefully in evaluating the forward looking statements and are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements. The forward
looking statements made in this document are made only as of the date of this
document and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update such
forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

     Badger Meter, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading marketer and manufacturer
of products, and a provider of services, using flow measurement and control
technologies serving markets worldwide. The Company was incorporated in 1905.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

     The Company's Internet address is http://www.badgermeter.com. The Company
makes available free of charge (other than an investor's own Internet access
charges) through its Internet website its Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those
reports, on the same day they are electronically filed with, or furnished to,
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The

                                        1
<PAGE>

Company is not including the information contained on or available through its
website as a part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

MARKETS AND PRODUCTS

     Badger Meter is a leading marketer and manufacturer of products using flow
measurement and control technologies developed both internally and with other
technology companies. Its products are used to measure and control the flow of
liquids in a variety of applications. The Company's product lines fall into two
general categories, utility and industrial. Two product lines, residential and
commercial water meters (with various meter reading technology systems), are
generally sold to water utilities. Industrial sales comprise the remainder of
the sales and include automotive fluid meters and systems, small precision
valves, electromagnetic meters, impeller flow meters and industrial process
meters (all with related accessories and instrumentation).

     Residential and commercial water meters and related systems provide the
majority of the Company's sales. Sales are classified as local (or manual) read
meters or automatic meter reading (AMR) products. Local read meters consist of a
water meter and a register. If the device is automatic, the register digitally
encodes the mechanical reading and has a radio frequency transmitter
communicating to a computerized system that collects the data, which in turn is
sent to specific utility computerized programs. Net sales and the corresponding
net income depend on unit volume and mix of products, with generally higher
margins on AMR products. There is a base level of annual business driven by
replacement units, and to a lesser extent, housing starts. It is the Company's
belief that conversion from local read meters to AMR products can accelerate
replacements of meters and result in growth. Badger Meter's strategy is to solve
customers' metering needs with its proprietary meter reading systems or other
systems available through alliances within the marketplace.

     The industrial products generally serve niche markets and have in the past
utilized technology derived from utility products to serve industrial uses. As
these markets evolve, these products are becoming more specialized to meet
industrial flow measurement and communication protocol requirements. Serving
these markets allows the Company to expand its technologies into other areas of
flow measurement and control, as well as utilizing existing capacity and
spreading fixed costs over a larger sales base.

     The Company's products are primarily manufactured and assembled in the
Company's Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Rio Rico, Arizona; Nogales,
Mexico and Brno, Czech Republic facilities. Products are also assembled in the
Company's Stuttgart, Germany and Nancy, France facilities.

     The Company's products are sold throughout the world through various
distribution channels including direct sales representatives, distributors and
independent sales representatives. There is a moderate seasonal impact on sales,
primarily relating to slightly higher sales of certain utility products during
the spring and summer months. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of
the Company's sales.

COMPETITION

     There are several competitors in each of the markets in which the Company
sells its products, and the competition varies from moderate to intense. Major
competitors include Sensus Metering Systems, Inc. (formerly Invensys, Inc.),
Neptune Technologies (formerly Neptune Technology Group, Inc.) and AMCO Water
Metering Systems (formerly ABB-Kent Meters, Inc.). A number of the Company's
competitors in certain markets have greater financial resources. The Company
believes it currently provides the leading technology in water meters and
associated automatic meter reading systems for water utilities. As a result of
significant research and development activities, the Company enjoys favorable
patent positions for several of its products.

BACKLOG

     The dollar amount of the Company's total backlog of unshipped orders at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $24,800,000 and $21,200,000, respectively. At
December 31, 2003, backlog is comprised of firm orders and signed contractual
commitments, or portions of such commitments, that call for shipment in 2004.
Backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of orders for large utility
projects.

                                        2

RAW MATERIALS

     Raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products include
metal or alloys (such as bronze, aluminum, stainless steel, cast iron, brass and
stellite), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic
subassemblies and components. There are multiple sources for these raw
materials, but the Company purchases some bronze castings and certain electronic
subassemblies from single suppliers. The Company believes these items would be
available from other sources, but that the loss of its current suppliers would
result in higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in
inventory and higher quality control costs in the short term. The Company
carries business interruption insurance on key suppliers. Prices may also be
affected by world commodity markets.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     Expenditures for research and development activities relating to the
development of new products, the improvement of existing products and
manufacturing process improvements were $6,070,000 in 2003, compared to
$5,658,000 during 2002, and $5,422,000 during 2001. Research and development
activities are primarily sponsored by the Company. The Company also engages in
some joint research and development with other companies.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

     The Company owns or controls many patents, trademarks, trade names and
license agreements in the United States and other countries that relate to its
products and technologies. No single patent, trademark, trade name or license is
material to the Company's business as a whole.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

     The Company is subject to contingencies relative to compliance with
federal, state and local provisions and regulations relating to the protection
of the environment. Currently, the Company is in the process of resolving an
issue relative to a landfill site. The Company does not believe the ultimate
resolution of this issue will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations, either from a cash flow perspective
or on the financial statements as a whole. Expenditures during 2003, 2002 and
2001 for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations were
not material and the Company does not anticipate any material future
expenditures.

     To ensure compliance with environmental regulations at Company sites, the
Board of Directors has directed the Audit and Compliance Committee to monitor
the Company's compliance with various regulatory authorities with regard to
environmental matters, among other things.

EMPLOYEES

     The Company and its subsidiaries employed 1,065 persons at December 31,
2003, of which 226 employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement
with District 10 of the International Association of Machinists. The Company is
currently operating under a four-year contract with the union, which expires
October 31, 2004. The Company believes it has good relations with the union and
all of its employees.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

     The Company has distributors and sales representatives throughout the
world. Additionally, the Company has a sales, assembly and distribution facility
in Stuttgart, Germany; sales and customer service offices in Mexico and
Singapore; a manufacturing facility in Nogales, Mexico; a manufacturing and
sales facility in Brno, Czech Republic; and a sales and assembly facility in
Nancy, France. The Company exports products from the United States that are
manufactured in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Rio Rico, Arizona.

     Information about the Company's foreign operations and export sales is
included in Note 10 "Industry Segment and Geographic Areas" in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this 2003 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND OVERVIEW
---------------------------------

     Badger Meter is a leading marketer and manufacturer of products using flow
measurement and control technologies developed both internally and with other
technology companies. Its products are used to measure and control the flow of
liquids in a variety of applications. The Company's product lines fall into two
general categories, utility and industrial. Two product lines, residential and
commercial water meters (with various meter reading technology systems), are
generally sold to water utilities. Industrial sales comprise the remainder of
the sales and include automotive fluid meters and systems, small precision
valves, electromagnetic meters, impeller flow meters and industrial process
meters (all with related accessories and instrumentation).

     Residential and commercial water meters and related systems provide the
majority of the Company's sales. Sales are classified as local (or manual) read
meters or automatic meter reading (AMR) products. Local read meters consist of a
water meter and a register. If the device is automatic, the register digitally
encodes the mechanical reading and has a radio frequency transmitter
communicating to a computerized system that collects
                                        7
<PAGE>

the data, which in turn is sent to specific utility computerized programs. Net
sales and the corresponding net income depend on unit volume and mix of
products, with generally higher margins on AMR products. There is a base level
of annual business driven by replacement units, and to a lesser extent, housing
starts. It is the Company's belief that conversion from local read meters to AMR
products can accelerate replacements of meters and result in growth. Badger
Meter's strategy is to solve customers' metering needs with its proprietary
meter reading systems or other systems available through alliances within the
marketplace.

     The industrial products generally serve niche markets and have in the past
utilized technology derived from utility products to serve industrial uses. As
these markets evolve, these products are becoming more specialized to meet
industrial flow measurement and communication protocol requirements. Serving
these markets allows the Company to expand its technologies into other areas of
flow measurement and control, as well as utilizing existing capacity and
spreading fixed costs over a larger sales base.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
---------------------

     In the second quarter of 2002, the Company completed two acquisitions, Data
Industrial Corporation (DIC) and MecaPlus Equipements SA (MPE). Through the
acquisition of DIC, the Company acquired an impeller flow meter allowing it to
serve a market not previously served. The acquisition of MPE allowed the Company
to expand into the lubrication system market in France while continuing to have
a market for its automotive fluid meters. These acquisitions were accounted for
under the purchase accounting method, and as a result, some of the variances
shown since December 31, 2002 were attributable to having a full year's results
in 2003 versus a partial year in 2002. The acquisitions are further discussed in
Part II, Item 8 under the heading "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"
of this 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K, under Note 3 B "Acquisitions" of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

NET SALES

     Badger Meter's net sales increased nearly $16.7 million, or 10.0%, for 2003
compared to 2002. The increase was the net result of the acquisitions and
increases in net sales of the Company's products as further discussed below.

     Net sales in 2003 included $21.7 million of sales related to the acquired
companies compared to $11.0 million in 2002, with the latter amount representing
sales only from the dates of the acquisitions. Without the acquisitions, net
sales increased $6.0 million, or 3.9%, over 2002 net sales. Overall, Company
sales trends are primarily affected by water meter demand by municipalities
(both residential and commercial), new product introduction and general market
conditions.

     Water meter sales are influenced by a continued industry movement away from
manual-read meters to automatic meter reading technologies, the lengthening of
the sales cycle and financial budget conditions of the various water utilities
served. Customers include independent distributors, large cities, private water
companies and numerous smaller municipal water utilities. One group of the
Company's sales representatives focuses on distributors, another on large
accounts (public and private), and a third group focuses on the remaining
customers.

     Residential and commercial water meter net sales represented 72.3% of total
sales in 2003 compared with 77.1% in 2002. These sales increased $4.1 million in
2003 to $133.1 million compared to $129.0 million in 2002. While the number of
units utilizing the Company's principal automatic meter reading technologies
increased, overall unit volume declined due to lower volumes of local (or
manual) read water meters. The automatic meter reading technologies carry a
higher price, which contributed to the increase in net sales. In addition, the
increase in net sales included sales of the newly introduced Orion AMR system.
Sales for the year were negatively influenced by longer sales cycles,
particularly early in 2003 as water utilities evaluated the requirements and
costs of increased security resulting from concerns over the war in Iraq and
terrorism.

     Industrial sales are affected by economic conditions, domestically and
internationally, in each of the markets served by the various product lines. In
total, the industrial products represented 27.7% of total net sales in 2003
compared with 22.9% in 2002. Industrial product sales increased 32.7% to $50.9
million in 2003 compared with $38.3 million in 2002. Much of this increase is
attributable to the two acquisitions completed in the second
                                        8
<PAGE>

quarter of 2002 and to the effect of the stronger euro on sales in Europe.
Without the acquisitions, the net change would be an increase of $1.9 million,
or 7.0%, primarily due to the strengthening of the euro resulting in higher
sales of automotive fluid meters and electromagnetic flow meters.

     International net sales are comprised primarily of sales of automotive
fluid meters and small valves in Europe, sales of water meters and related
technologies in Latin America, and sales of valves and other metering products
throughout the world. In Europe, sales are made in both U.S. dollars and euros.
Most other international sales are made in U.S. dollars. The Company is able to
partially hedge its euro exposure by holding euro-denominated debt.
International sales, excluding the effects of the prior year acquisition,
increased 5.0% to $11.2 million from $10.6 million in 2002 due to increased
sales into Latin America.

     The 2002 net sales included $11.0 million, or 6.6%, related to the acquired
companies. Without the acquisitions, net sales increased $17.8 million, or
14.2%, over sales in 2001. In addition, the sales for 2001 included
approximately $1.4 million of net sales from product lines that were
discontinued. Residential and commercial water meter sales increased nearly
$20.6 million over 2001 due to increased volumes of both plastic and bronze
local-read meters as well as increased sales of AMR technologies.

GROSS MARGINS

     Gross margins were 32.9%, 33.5% and 32.1% for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The decrease between 2003 and 2002 was primarily due to lower unit
volumes resulting in higher absorbed factory costs, the inability to increase
prices for higher incurred costs due to market conditions, and to a lesser
extent, the addition of MPE which has lower margins as an assembly operation.
Somewhat offsetting these decreased volumes were increased volumes of AMR
products, which carry higher margins. The increase in gross margin between 2002
and 2001 was due to increased sales volumes, which absorbed factory capacity
costs, as well as continuing efforts to reduce product costs. Margins in 2002
were also affected by higher sales of automatic meter reading products.

OPERATING EXPENSES

     Selling, engineering and administration costs increased 8.4% in 2003 over
2002 levels. Some of the increase was attributable to the full year effects in
2003 of the prior year acquisitions, and to the severance costs of headcount
reductions at MPE to better position it in the market. Without the effects of
the acquisitions and the headcount reduction costs, these expenses increased
1.4% primarily due to increased health care expenses offset somewhat by
continuing cost control efforts. Selling, engineering and administration costs
increased 11.4% in 2002 over 2001 levels. Much of this increase was attributable
to the newly acquired companies, as well as increased incentive compensation as
a result of meeting sales and earnings targets.

INTEREST EXPENSE

     Interest expense decreased $112,000 in 2003 compared to 2002. This was
primarily due to continuing favorable rates on the commercial paper the Company
used to finance its operations in 2003, as well as the reduction in overall
debt. Interest expense increased $468,000 in 2002 compared to 2001. This
increase was due primarily to the increased borrowing needs as a result of the
Company's acquisition of two new companies and the payment of $9.4 million into
the Company's pension plan in 2002. These factors were offset somewhat by a
decrease in interest rates during 2002.

OTHER INCOME, NET

     Other income, net in 2003, 2002 and 2001 related primarily to foreign
exchange gains, particularly in 2003 due to the strengthening of the euro
against the U.S. dollar. The Company has euro-based receivables on its corporate
ledger that relate to its foreign subsidiaries, for which translation gain was
recognized through the income statement while the offsetting translation loss on
the corresponding subsidiary's debt was recognized as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss). The significant strengthening of the euro in 2003
resulted in a translation gain of $781,000. During the second quarter, the
Company borrowed euro-based debt domestically to hedge the euro-based receivable
exposure.

                                        9
<PAGE>

INCOME TAXES

     Income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes was 43.2%,
36.4% and 32.9% for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 from
2002 was primarily due to recording a valuation reserve on the operating losses
of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, as further described below.
The increase in 2002 from 2001 was due primarily to a higher level of pre-tax
earnings compared to 2001 that reduced the percentage effects of certain
permanent items on book-tax differences.

     In 2002, the Company determined that there were excess reserves for prior
year taxes, and accordingly reduced tax expense by $675,000. At the same time,
the Company concluded that it was not certain that net operating loss
carryforwards for certain foreign subsidiaries would be realized through future
profits, and as such a $475,000 valuation reserve was created by increasing the
tax expense. The net result of these transactions did not significantly affect
the effective tax rate for 2002.

     In 2003, the valuation reserve was further increased to $1,225,000 due to
continued realization uncertainties for foreign net operating loss
carryforwards. The increase in the reserve was recorded as additional tax
expense, which significantly increased the Company's effective rate for 2003. At
December 31, 2003, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards at
certain European subsidiaries totaling $6.2 million. The carryforwards have
unlimited carryforward periods, which can be used to offset future taxable
income at these locations.

NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

     As a result of the above-mentioned items, net earnings were $7,577,000,
$7,271,000 and $3,364,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. On a diluted
basis, earnings per share were $2.30, $2.20 and $1.03, respectively, for the
same periods.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
-------------------------------

     The main sources of liquidity for the Company are cash from operations and
borrowing capacity. Cash provided by operations in 2003 increased $1.9 million,
or 15.2%, compared to 2002 primarily as a result of increased earnings and no
required payment to the pension plan, offset by increases in receivables and
inventories. Cash provided by operations increased $3.6 million, or 42.5%, for
2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of increased earnings, deferral of
income taxes, higher current liabilities, and lower receivables (net of acquired
companies). Offsetting these items somewhat in 2002 was a $9.4 million payment
to the Company's pension plan to maintain full funding status.

     Receivables increased 18.8% between December 31, 2002 and 2003 due
primarily to higher fourth quarter sales in 2003 versus 2002. Inventories
increased 17.8% due primarily to the introduction of several new products in
2003 as well as longer lead-time on certain electronic components associated
with the increased sales of AMR products. The increases in both receivables and
inventories were also affected to a lesser extent by the strength of the euro on
foreign subsidiaries' balances. Capital expenditures totaled $7.1 million in
2003, $5.9 million in 2002 and $5.0 million in 2001. These amounts vary due to
the timing of capital expenditures. The Company believes it will be able to
increase production with minimal additional capital expenditures.

     Prepaid pension decreased $1.2 million at the end of 2003 compared to the
same date in 2002. This was the result of pension expense during 2003 and a
partial refund from prior year's overfunding. Assumptions for determining
pension liability, expected return on assets and annual expense are reviewed
and, if appropriate, adjusted annually. The impacts of hypothetical changes in
certain assumptions is difficult to determine as economic factors can often
impact multiple assumptions and inputs at the same time. The Company believes
its current assumptions are reasonable. At December 31, 2003, the market value
of the assets in the Company's pension plan was $43.9 million. Included in the
Company's December 31, 2003 prepaid pension balance was $17 million of
unrecognized net actuarial losses.

     The amount of net goodwill recorded at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was
$7,089,000 and $5,697,000, respectively. The increase included $635,000 due to
the translation effect resulting from changes in the euro exchange rate for two
of the Company's subsidiaries with euro based functional currency. In addition,
the increase included $757,000 for the amount of severance costs related to the
termination of several MPE
                                        10
<PAGE>

employees in connection with management's initial assessment at the date of
acquisition. The amount of the severance cost was not estimable until the first
quarter of 2003. As of December 31, 2003, $277,000 associated with the severance
remains accrued on the balance sheet.

     Short-term debt decreased $16.8 million in 2003. This decrease was offset
by proceeds from long-term debt obtained at year end, the proceeds of which were
used to repay much of the existing short- and long-term debt. The increase in
payables between years is primarily the result of the timing of purchases.
Accrued compensation and employee benefits increased $0.6 million due to
increased incentive costs associated with improved sales and earnings levels.
Income and other taxes increased $1.0 million as a result of increased earnings
during 2003 and the timing of tax payments.

     Total outstanding long-term debt (both the current and long-term portions)
increased $11.1 million, which was the net result of new long-term instruments
obtained in late 2003, offset by regular debt payments. None of the Company's
debt carries financial covenants or is collateralized.

     Common Stock and capital in excess of par value both increased during 2003
due to stock issued in connection with the exercise of stock options and
treasury stock issuances. Employee benefit stock decreased by $250,000 due to
shares released as a result of payments made on the ESSOP loan. Treasury stock
increased due to shares repurchased during the year.

     Badger Meter's financial condition remains strong. The Company believes
that its operating cash flows, available borrowing capacity including
$33,166,000 of unused credit lines, and its ability to raise capital provide
adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital and
development of new products.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
------------------------------

     The Company guarantees the debt of the Badger Meter Officers' Voting Trust
(BMOVT), from which the trust obtained loans from a bank on behalf of the
officers of the Company in order to purchase shares of the Company's Common
Stock. The officers' loan amounts are collateralized by the Company's shares
that were purchased with the loans' proceeds. There have been no loans made to
officers by the BMOVT since July 2002. The amount of such debt that the Company
guaranteed was $1,754,000 and $2,380,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The current loan was renewed in April 2003 with an expiration date
of April 2004, at which time it is expected to be renewed. The fair market value
of this guarantee at December 31, 2003 continues to be insignificant because the
collateral value of the shares exceeds the loan amount. The Company has no other
undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
-----------------------

     The Company guarantees the outstanding debt of the Badger Meter Employee
Savings and Stock Ownership Plan (ESSOP) that is recorded in long-term debt,
offset by a similar amount of unearned compensation that has been recorded as a
reduction of shareholders' equity. The loan amount is collateralized by shares
of the Company's Common Stock. Payments of $250,000 and $365,000 in 2003 and
2002, respectively, reduced the loan to $1,285,000 at December 31, 2003. The
terms of the loan allow variable payments of principal with the final principal
and interest payment due in June 2004, at which time it is expected to be
renewed.

     As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no material purchase obligations
other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory
and property, plant and equipment, which generally have terms of less than 90
days. The Company also has long-term obligations related to its pension and
postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in Note 7 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. As of the most recent actuarial measurement
date, no pension plan contributions are anticipated in 2004 and postretirement
medical claims are paid as they are submitted. Postretirement medical claims are
anticipated to be $1,276,000 in 2004.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES
-------------------------------------------------

     The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in Note 1, the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. The Company's more significant estimates relate primarily to
several judgmental reserves: allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for
obsolete inventories, warranty reserve, and the health care reserve. Each of
these judgmental reserves is evaluated quarterly and is reviewed with the
Company's Disclosure Committee and the Audit and Compliance Committee of the
Board of Directors. The basis for the reserve amounts is determined by analyzing
the minimum and maximum amount of anticipated exposure for each account, and
then selecting the most appropriate amount within the range based upon
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. This method has been used for all years in
the presented financials and has been used consistently throughout each year.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

     The criteria used for calculating each of the reserve amounts varies by
type of reserve. For the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve, significant
past due receivable balances are reviewed in conjunction with applying
historical write-off ratios to the remaining balances. The calculation for the
allowance for obsolete inventories reserve is determined by analyzing the
relationship between the age and quantity of items on hand versus estimated
usage to determine if excess quantities exist. The calculation for warranty and
after-sale costs reserve uses criteria that includes known potential problems on
past sales as well as historical claims ratios for current sales. The health
care reserve is determined by using medical cost trend analyses, reviewing
subsequent payments made and estimating unbilled amounts. The changes in the
balances of these reserves at December 31, 2003 compared to the prior year were
not material.

OTHER MATTERS
-------------

     The Company believes it is in compliance with the various environmental
statutes and regulations to which the Company's domestic and international
operations are subject. Currently, the Company is in the process of
                                        12
<PAGE>

resolving an issue relative to a landfill site. Provision has been made for all
known settlement costs, which are not material.

     The Company is also a defendant in several multi-party asbestos suits
generally as a result of its membership in certain trade organizations. The
cases are pending in state courts in Mississippi, Texas and Illinois. The
Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations, either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements
as a whole.

     On January 1, 2003, the Company changed the functional currency of one of
its European subsidiaries to the euro from the U.S. dollar as a result of being
sold by a subsidiary whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar to another
subsidiary of the Company where the majority of their activities are euro-based.
This change resulted in a credit of $479,000 to other comprehensive income,
offset by a similar amount to the subsidiary's inventory and property, plant and
equipment balances. The impact to the Company in the long-term is not expected
to be significant.

MARKET RISKS
------------

     In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various
market risks, including commodity prices, foreign currency rates and interest
rates. The Company typically does not hold or issue derivative instruments and
has a policy specifically prohibiting the use of such instruments for trading
purposes.

     Commodity risk is managed by keeping abreast of economic conditions and
locking in purchase prices for quantities that correspond to the Company's
forecasted usage.

     The Company's foreign currency risk relates to the sales of products to
foreign customers, specifically European customers, as most other foreign sales
are made in U.S. dollars. The Company uses lines of credit with U.S. and
European banks to offset currency exposure related to European receivables and
other monetary assets. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company's foreign
currency net monetary assets were substantially offset by comparable debt
resulting in no material exposure.

     The Company's short-term debt on December 31, 2003 was floating rate debt
with market values approximating carrying value. Fixed rate debt was principally
a U.S. dollar term loan with a 4.8% interest rate and a euro dollar revolving
term loan with a 4% interest rate. For the floating rate debt, future annual
interest costs will fluctuate based upon short-term interest rates. For the
short-term debt on hand on December 31, 2003, the effect of a 1% change in
interest rates is approximately $35,000 before income tax.

Operations" under the heading "Market Risks" in this 2003 Annual Report on Form

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Badger Meter, Inc.

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Badger
Meter, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Badger Meter,
Inc. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

     As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective
January 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                        DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001

Property, Plant and Equipment

     Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, principally by the
straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets are: for land
improvements, 15 years; for buildings and improvements, 10 - 39 years; and, for
machinery and equipment, 3 - 20 years.

Long-Lived Assets

     Property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are
reviewed for impairment, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets," whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected
undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset or
group of assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value
and carrying value of the asset or group of assets.

Intangible Assets

     Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their
estimated useful lives ranging from 5.5 to 10 years. The Company does not have
any intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives. Accumulated amortization
at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $384,000 and $226,000, respectively.
Amortization expense expected to be recognized for each of the next three years
beginning with 2004 is $176,000, and $171,000 in 2007 and $117,000 in 2008. The
carrying value and accumulated amortization by major class of intangible assets
are as follows:

Goodwill

     FASB Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," became
effective for the Company on January 1, 2002. This statement required companies
to stop amortizing goodwill and to test for impairment at least annually. During
2003 and 2002, the Company tested its goodwill balance for impairment in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 142 and no adjustments were recorded to
goodwill as a result of those reviews. Prior to 2002, goodwill was amortized on
a straight-line basis. The amount of net goodwill recorded at December 31, 2003
and 2002 was $7,089,000 and $5,697,000, respectively. The increase included
$635,000 due to the translation effect resulting from changes in the euro
exchange rate for two of the Company's subsidiaries with euro based functional
currency, and a $757,000 increase for the accrual of severance costs related to
MPE, which is further discussed in Note 3B "Acquisitions."

                        DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001

Revenue Recognition

     Revenues are generally recognized upon shipment of product, which
corresponds with the transfer of title. The costs of shipping are billed to the
customer upon shipment and are included in cost of sales. A small portion of the
Company's sales include shipments of products combined with services, such as
meters sold with installation. The product and installation components of these
multiple deliverable arrangements are considered separate units of accounting.
The value of these separate units of accounting are determined based on their
relative fair values determined on a stand-alone basis. Revenue is recognized
when the last element is delivered, which generally corresponds with
installation.

Warranty and After-Sale Costs

     The Company estimates and records provisions for warranties and other
after-sale costs in the period the sale is recorded. After-sale costs represent
a variety of activities outside of the written warranty policy, such as
investigation of unanticipated problems after the customer has installed the
product, or analysis of water quality issues. Changes in the Company's warranty
and after-sale costs reserve are as follows:

(a)  In 2002, the reserve increased $30,000 and $195,000 related to the
     acquisition of DIC and MPE, respectively. Refer to Note 3 B "Acquisitions"
     for a description of the acquisitions.

Research and Development

     Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and
amounted to $6,070,000, $5,658,000, and $5,422,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Other Income, Net

     Included in other income, net are foreign currency gains and losses, which
are recognized as incurred. The Company's functional currency for all of its
foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, with the exception of Badger Meter
France (the French parent holding company of MPE), MPE and Badger Meter Czech
Republic, whose functional currency is the euro. Foreign currency gains of
$781,000 were reported in 2003 compared to $267,000 and $99,000 in 2002 and
2001, respectively, primarily related to the strengthening of the euro versus
the U.S. dollar.

Stock Option Plans

     The Company has six stock option plans which provide for the issuance of
options to key employees and directors of the Company. Refer to Note 5 "Stock
Option Plans" for a description of the plans.

     As allowed by FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," and Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-based Compensation
-- Transition and Disclosure," the Company has elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB
25), in accounting for its stock option plans. Under APB 25, the Company does
not recognize compensation expense upon the issuance of its stock options
because the option terms are fixed and the exercise price equals the market
price of the underlying stock on the grant date. Pro forma information regarding
net earnings and earnings per

share required by FASB Statement No. 123 has been determined as if the Company
had accounted for stock options granted since January 1, 1995 under the fair
value method of that Statement. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used

     The weighted-average fair values of options granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001
were $6.03, $4.79 and $6.28 per share, respectively. The following table
illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123 to
stock-based employee compensation. These pro forma calculations only include the
effects of options granted since January 1, 1995. As such, the impacts are not
necessarily indicative of the effects on net earnings of future years.

changing its functional currency from the U.S. dollar to the euro, effective
January 1, 2003.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                        DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001

Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Reclassifications

     Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2002 Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements to conform to the 2003 presentation.

Accounting Pronouncements

     In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,"
which expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance concerning when
a company should include in its financial statements the assets, liabilities and
activities of another entity. A Variable Interest Entity (VIE) does not share
economic risk and reward through typical equity ownership arrangements, but by
contractual or other relationships that redistribute economic risks and rewards
among equity holders and other parties. Once an entity is determined to be a
VIE, the party with the controlling financial interest, the primary beneficiary,
is required to consolidate it. FIN 46 also requires disclosure about VIEs that a
company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant
variable interest. The adoption of applicable provisions of FIN 46 in 2003 did
not have an impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. Further, the adoption of the remaining provisions of FIN 46 in 2004
is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 2  COMMON STOCK

     The Company has Common Stock, and also a Common Shares Rights Agreement,
which grants certain rights to existing holders of Common Stock. Subject to
certain conditions, the rights are redeemable by the Company and are
exchangeable for shares of Common Stock. The rights have no voting power and
expire on May 26, 2008.

NOTE 3  AFFILIATED COMPANY AND ACQUISITIONS

  A.  AFFILIATED COMPANY

     In 2003, the Company sold its 15% interest in a Mexican company, Medidores
Azteca, S.A. (Azteca) for the original cost of $75,000. During 2003, 2002 and
2001, the Company sold $512,000, $1,201,000 and $689,000, respectively, of
product to Azteca. Receivables from Azteca at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were
$617,000 and $621,000, respectively.

  B.  ACQUISITIONS

     On May 1, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock
of Data Industrial Corporation (DIC) of Mattapoisett, Massachusetts for $5.1
million net of cash acquired. This amount included direct acquisition costs. DIC
manufactures and markets a line of impeller flow meters that are sold to
commercial and industrial markets.

     On June 1, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock
of MecaPlus Equipements SA (MPE) of Nancy, France, for $3.5 million net of cash

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                        DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001

     The Company finalized the allocation of the purchase price of DIC and MPE
during 2003. There were no adjustments recorded for DIC after the preliminary
allocations at December 31, 2002. During 2003, goodwill relating to MPE
increased $757,000 from the December 31, 2002 amount to reflect the accrual of
severances related to the termination of several MPE employees in connection
with management's initial assessment at the date of acquisition. The amount of
the severance cost was not estimable until the first quarter of 2003. As of
December 31, 2003, $277,000 associated with the severances remains reserved. The
following table shows the final purchase price allocation for each acquisition.

     The acquisitions of DIC and MPE were accounted for under the purchase
method and the results of both have been included in the Company's consolidated
results from the date of acquisition. These acquisitions are part of the
Company's strategy to broaden its line of meters for niche industrial markets.

     The following pro forma information combines historical results, as if DIC
and MPE had been owned by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001.

     The pro forma amounts include the results of the stand-alone operations of
DIC and MPE, plus the impact of purchase accounting entries, which include
amortization of acquired intangibles, depreciation of the step up basis of the
fixed assets, and interest expense on debt incurred to finance the purchases.
The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred
if the acquisitions had been completed as of the beginning of each fiscal period
presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results.

     In 2003, DIC was dissolved and the production of the DIC impeller flow
meter product line was transferred from the Company's facility in Mattapoisett,
Massachusetts to its facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma in order to better utilize
existing capacity. The lease on the Massachusetts facility expired in early
2004. Expenses associated with this decision included severance costs and the
disposal of leasehold improvements of $119,000 and $67,000, respectively, of
which $173,000 was expensed during 2003.

                        DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001

     The Company makes commitments in the normal course of business. At December
31, 2003, the Company had various contractual obligations, including royalty
commitments, minimum product purchases, other distribution rights, investment,
and research and development commitments, that were $5,115,000, of which
$1,780,000 is due in 2004 and the remainder due from 2005 through 2007.

  B.  CONTINGENCIES

     In the normal course of business, the Company is named in legal
proceedings. There are currently no material legal proceedings pending with
respect to the Company. The more significant legal proceedings are discussed
below.

     The Company is subject to contingencies relative to environmental laws and
regulations. Currently, the Company is in the process of resolving an issue
relative to a landfill site. Provision has been made for all known settlement
costs, which are not material.

     The Company is also a defendant in several multi-party asbestos suits
generally as a result of its membership in certain trade organizations. The
cases are pending in state courts in Mississippi, Texas and Illinois. The
Company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of
operations, either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements
as a whole.

     The Company has evaluated its worldwide operations to determine if any
risks and uncertainties exist that could severely impact its operations in the
near term. The Company does not believe that there are any significant risks.
However, the Company does rely on single suppliers for certain castings and
components in several of its product lines. Although alternate sources of supply
exist for these items, loss of certain suppliers could temporarily disrupt
operations in the short term. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by
working closely with key suppliers, purchasing minimal amounts from alternative
suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate.

     The Company reevaluates its exposures on a periodic basis and makes
adjustments to reserves as appropriate.

     The fair value of the pension plan assets was $43,877,000 at December 31,
2003 and $38,815,000 at December 31, 2002. The variation in the fair value of
the assets between September and December of each year is primarily from the
change in the market value of the underlying investments. The Company does not
expect to contribute funds to its pension plan in 2004.

     The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of
equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return
of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established
through careful consideration of short- and long-term plan liabilities, plan
funded status and corporate financial condition. The investment portfolio
contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments.
Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks,
as well as growth, value, and

</Table>

     The pension plan has a separately determined accumulated benefit obligation
which is the actuarial present value of benefits based on service rendered and
current and past compensation levels. This differs from the projected benefit
obligation in that it includes no assumption about future compensation levels.
The accumulated benefit obligation was $39,642,000 and $38,501,000 at September
30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     The Company also maintains a supplemental non-qualified unfunded pension
plan for certain officers and other key employees. In both 2003 and 2002, the
Company recorded an additional minimum liability to recognize the difference
between amounts originally recorded and the accumulated benefit obligation as of
the September 30 measurement date. A charge was recorded in other comprehensive
income (loss), net of the tax effect, for $49,000 and $453,000 in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Pension expense for this plan was $429,000 and $583,000 at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and the amount accrued was $2,706,000
and $2,949,000 as of the end of the same periods.

  B.  OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

     The Company has certain postretirement plans that provide medical benefits
for certain retirees and eligible dependents. The following table sets forth the
components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001:

     The discount rate used to measure the accumulated postretirement benefit

</Table>

     The discount rate used to measure the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 6.5% for 2003 and 7.0% for 2002. Because the plan requires the
Company to establish fixed Company contribution amounts for retiree health care
benefits, future health care cost trends do not impact the Company's accruals or
provisions. The Company estimates that it will pay $1,276,000 in other
postretirement benefits in 2004.

     In January 2004, the FASB issued Financial Staff Position No. FAS 106-1,
"Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" (the Act), to address the
impact of the Act enacted in December 2003. The Act provides a prescription drug
benefit for Medicare eligible employees starting in 2006. The impact of the Act
on the Company is not yet known.

  C.  BADGER METER EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

     The Badger Meter Employee Savings and Stock Ownership Plan (the ESSOP) has
used proceeds from loans, guaranteed by the Company, to purchase Common Stock of
the Company from shares held in treasury. The Company is obligated to contribute
sufficient cash to the ESSOP to enable it to repay the loan principal and
interest. The principal amount of the loan was $1,285,000 as of December 31,
2003, and $1,535,000 as of December 31, 2002. This principal amount has been
recorded as long-term debt and a like amount of unearned compensation has been
recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

     The Company made principal payments of $250,000, $365,000 and $400,000 in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These payments released shares of Common
Stock (12,157 in 2003, 17,749 in 2002 and 19,451 in 2001) for allocation to
participants in the ESSOP. The ESSOP held unreleased shares of 62,487, 74,644
and 92,393 as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, with the fair
value of $2,384,000, $2,396,000 and $2,072,000 as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Unreleased shares are not considered outstanding for
purposes of computing earnings per share.

     The ESSOP includes a voluntary 401(k) savings plan which allows certain
employees to defer up to 20% of their income on a pretax basis subject to limits
on maximum amounts. The Company matches 25% of each employee's contribution,
with the match percentage applying to a maximum of 7% of the employee's salary.
The match is paid using Company stock released through the ESSOP loan payments.
For ESSOP shares purchased prior to 1993, compensation expense is recognized
based on the original purchase price of the shares released and

                                        30

                        DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001

dividends on unreleased shares are charged to retained earnings. For shares
purchased after 1992, expense is based on the market value of the shares on the
date released and dividends on unreleased shares are accounted for as additional
interest expense. At December 31, 2003, the Company intends to contribute
$220,000 to the ESSOP in 2004 to be used to pay down the existing loan. This
commitment releases shares to satisfy the 401(k) match for 2003. Compensation
expense of $231,000, $234,000 and $268,000 was recognized for the match for
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     The valuation reserve relates primarily to net operating loss carryforwards
in certain foreign entities where there is uncertainty regarding the realization
of the deferred tax benefit through future earnings. At December 31, 2003, the
Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards at certain European
subsidiaries totaling $6.2 million. The carryforwards have unlimited
carryforward periods, which can be used to offset future taxable income from
these subsidiaries.

     No provision for federal income taxes was made on the earnings of foreign
subsidiaries that are considered permanently invested or that would be offset by
foreign tax credits upon distribution. Such undistributed earnings at December
31, 2003 were $608,000.

     Interest on the ESSOP debt may be charged at either prime rate or at LIBOR
plus 1.5%. As of December 31, 2003, the LIBOR-based loan had an interest rate of
2.7%. The terms of the loan allow variable payments of principal with the final
principal and interest payment due June 20, 2004, at which time it is expected
to be renewed. The interest expense on the ESSOP debt was $27,000, $31,000 and
$76,000, which was net of dividends on unallocated ESSOP shares of $39,000,
$45,000 and $54,000 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                        DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001

     In July 2001, the Company borrowed $1,700,000 in connection with the
construction of a new manufacturing facility in the Czech Republic, of which
$734,000 and $1,214,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The debt bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.75% and the rate is set
daily with a rate of 2.9% at December 31, 2003. Payments are due in quarterly
installments through April 2005. Principal payments total $486,000 for 2004,
with a final principal payment of $248,000 in 2005.

     In December 2003, the Company obtained two long-term, unsecured loans to
replace existing short- and long-term debt. The Company secured a $16,000,000,
3-year term loan that bears interest at 4.8% with annual principal payments of
$5,071,000, $5,331,000 and $5,598,000 in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. In
addition, the Company secured a $12,000,000 euro-based, revolving loan facility
that bears interest at 4% and expires in April 2007. Borrowings under this
revolving loan facility were $11,970,000 at December 31, 2003.

     Cash, receivables and payables are reflected in the financial statements at
fair value. Short-term debt is comprised of notes payable drawn against the
Company's lines of credit and commercial paper. Because of the short-term nature
of these instruments, the carrying value approximates the fair value. The
$734,000 outstanding bank debt in the Czech Republic is a term loan with
variable interest based upon daily LIBOR rates; accordingly, carrying value
approximates the fair value. The $16,000,000 term loan and $11,970,000
outstanding under the euro-based revolving loan facility were obtained in
December 2003 at current interest rates and therefore carrying value
approximates fair value.

     The Company guarantees the debt of the Badger Meter Officers' Voting Trust
(BMOVT), from which the trust obtained loans on behalf of the officers of the
Company from a bank in order to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock.
The officers' loan amounts are collateralized by the Company's shares that were
purchased with the loans' proceeds. There have been no loans made to officers by
the BMOVT since July 2002. The amount that the Company guaranteed was $1,754,000
and $2,380,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The current loan was
renewed in April 2003 with an expiration date of April 2004, at which time it is
expected to be renewed. The fair market value of this guarantee at December 31,
2003 continues to be insignificant because the collateral value of the shares
exceeds the loan amount.

installed. This resulted in net sales and margins for the third quarter being
overstated by $488,000 and $306,000, respectively, or $ .06 per diluted share,
and the fourth quarter being understated by the same amounts. Accordingly,
amounts for the full year of 2003 were correctly recorded.

     Fourth quarter 2002 adjustments, primarily related to the determination of
the functional currency of MPE, resulted in an increase in net earnings of
$187,000 or $ .06 per diluted share. These adjustments represent reversals of
amounts recorded in previous quarters.

     Badger Meter, Inc. Common Stock is listed on the American Stock Exchange
under the symbol BMI. Earnings per share is computed independently for each
quarter. As such, the annual per share amount may not equal the sum of the
quarterly amounts due to rounding. The Company currently anticipates continuing
to pay cash dividends. Shareholders of record as of December 31, 2003 and 2002
totaled 535 and 494, respectively, for Common Stock. Voting trusts are counted
