                                     Part I


Item 1.   Business

          Badger Meter, Inc. (the "company") is a marketer and manufacturer of
products, and a provider of services, using flow measurement and control
technologies serving markets worldwide. The company was incorporated in 1905.

                              Markets and Products

          The company's products are sold to water utilities, original equipment
manufacturers and various industrial customers primarily operating in the
following markets: water, wastewater and process waters; energy and petroleum;
food and beverage; pharmaceutical; chemical; and concrete.

          The company has five major product lines: residential and
commercial/industrial water meters (with related technologies), automotive fluid
meters, small precision valves and industrial process meters. Water meters and
related systems produce the majority of the company's sales. A "water meter
system" generally consists of a water meter, a register (some with an interface
technology for communicating the reading), packaging and the monitoring or
computerized management system used to collect and relay the reading.

          The company's products are primarily manufactured and assembled in the
company's Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Rio Rico, Arizona
facilities. Assembly is also done in the company's Nogales, Mexico and
Stuttgart, Germany facility.

          Badger Meter's products are sold throughout the world through various
distribution channels including direct sales representatives, distributors and
independent sales representatives. There is only a moderate seasonal impact on
sales, primarily relating to slightly higher sales of certain utility products
during the spring and summer months. No single customer accounts for more than
10% of the company's sales.

                                   Competition

          There are several competitors in each of the markets in which the
company sells its products, and the competition varies from moderate to intense.
Major competitors include Invensys, Inc., Schlumberger Industries, Inc. and
ABB-Kent Meters, Inc. A number of the company's competitors in certain markets
have greater financial resources. The company believes it currently provides the
leading technology in certain types of automated and automatic water meter
systems and high precision valves. As a result of significant research and
development activities, the company enjoys favorable patent positions for
several of its products.

                                     Backlog

          The dollar amount of the company's total backlog of unshipped orders
at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $20,400,000 and $24,985,000, respectively. The
company expects to ship nearly all of the December 31, 2000 backlog in 2001.

                                  Raw Materials

          Raw materials used in the manufacture of the company's products
include metal or alloys (such as bronze, aluminum, stainless steel, cast iron,
brass and stellite), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic
subassemblies and components. There are multiple sources for these raw
materials, but the company purchases some bronze castings and certain electronic
subassemblies from single suppliers. The company believes these items would be
available from other sources, but that the loss of its current suppliers would
result in higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in
inventory and higher quality control costs. The company carries business
interruption insurance on key suppliers. Prices may also be affected by world
commodity markets.

                                       2

                            Research and Development

          Expenditures for research and development activities relating to the
development of new products, the improvement of existing products and
manufacturing process improvements were $6,562,000 during 2000, as compared to
$6,012,000 during 1999 and $6,105,000 during 1998. Research and development
activities are primarily sponsored by the company. The company also engages in
some joint research and development with other companies.

                                Intangible Assets

          The company owns or controls many patents, trademarks, trade names and
license agreements in the United States and other countries that relate to its
products and technologies. No single patent, trademark, trade name or license is
material to the company's business as a whole.

                            Environmental Protection

          The company is subject to contingencies relative to compliance with
Federal, State and local provisions and regulations relating to the protection
of the environment. Currently the company is in the process of resolving issues
relative to two landfill sites. The company does not believe the ultimate
resolution of either of these claims will have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations. Expenditures during 2000 and 1999 for compliance with
environmental control provisions and regulations were not material and the
company does not anticipate any material future expenditures.

          To insure compliance with environmental regulations at company sites,
the Board of Directors has established a Compliance Committee that monitors the
company's compliance with various regulatory authorities in regard to
environmental matters, among other things.

                                    Employees

          The company and its subsidiaries employed 956 persons at December 31,
2000, of which 245 employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement
with District 10 of the International Association of Machinists. The company is
currently operating under a four-year contract with the union, which expires on
October 31, 2004. The company has good relations with the union and all of its
employees.

                       Foreign Operations and Export Sales

          The company has distributors and sales representatives throughout the
world. Additionally, the company has a sales, assembly and distribution facility
in Stuttgart, Germany, sales and customer service offices in Mexico City and
Singapore, and two assembly facilities in Nogales, Mexico. The company exports
products manufactured in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Rio Rico,
Arizona.

          Information about the company's foreign operations and export sales is
included in Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the
company's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders and such information is
incorporated herein by reference.

                  Financial Information about Industry Segments

          The company operates in one industry segment as a marketer and
manufacturer of various flow measurement and control products.
