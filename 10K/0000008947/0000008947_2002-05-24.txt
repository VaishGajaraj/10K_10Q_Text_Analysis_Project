                                     PART I

Item 1.  Business

AZZ incorporated ("AZZ" or the "Company") was established in 1956 and
incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas. The Company is an electrical
equipment and components manufacturer serving the global growth markets of power
generation, transmission and distribution, and industrial markets as well as a
leading provider of hot dip galvanizing services to the steel fabrication market
nationwide.

The Company offers products through two distinct business segments, Electrical
and Industrial Products and the Galvanizing Services Segment.

The Company changed its name from Aztec Manufacturing Co. to AZZ incorporated on
July 10, 2000. The Company believes the new name more effectively represents the
scope of its business beyond manufacturing, reflects the changes in the Company
over the past 10 years and better enables it to cross-leverage its marketing
opportunities through the use of a common name and new image.

On November 1, 2001, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of
Central Electric Company (CEC), headquartered in Fulton, Missouri. CEC is
comprised of three operations consisting of a metal clad switchgear facility in
Fulton, Missouri, a power center operation in Tulsa, Oklahoma and a relay panel
and non-segmented bus-duct operation in Nashville, Tennessee. The consolidated
annual revenues of CEC are expected to be approximately $50 million. The cost of
the acquisition was $28.5 million including transaction costs. The acquisition
was paid for with $26.7 million of cash; $1.8 million in AZZ incorporated stock
(97,297 shares of common stock), which was valued based upon the average value
of the stock at the time of the public announcement of the acquisition. The
operating assets acquired included $1.2 million in cash.

On November 1, 2001, the Company also acquired the operating assets of Carter &
Crawley, Inc., headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina for $15.4 million in
cash including transaction costs. The operating assets acquired included $2.2
million in cash. Carter & Crawley, Inc. designs, manufactures and installs relay
panels and custom control systems for utilities and industrial manufacturers.
The annual revenues of Carter & Crawley are expected to be approximately $20
million.

Electrical and Industrial Products Segment

The Electrical and Industrial Products Segment produces highly engineered
specialty electrical products as well as lighting and tubular products. The
Company markets and sells its products throughout the global market place. The
electrical portion of this segment designs, manufactures, and configures
products that distribute electrical power to a generator, transformer, switching
device or other electrical configurations. These electrical systems are supplied
to the power generation, transmission and distribution markets as well as the
industrial market. Also provided by this segment are industrial lighting and
tubular products used for petrochemical and industrial applications. Lighting
products are provided to the petroleum, food processing, and power generation
industries, to consumer retail outlets and to industries with unique lighting
challenges. The principal markets for tubular products is the petroleum
industry. The markets for the Company's Electrical and Industrial Products
Segment are highly competitive and consist of a few large national companies, as
well as numerous small independents. Competition is based primarily on product
quality, range of product line, price and service. While some of these companies
are much larger and better financed than the Company, the Company believes that
it can compete favorably with them. Copper, aluminum and steel are the primary
raw materials used in this segment and are readily available. This segment's
products are sold though manufacturers' representatives and its internal sales
force. This segment is not dependent on any single customer or limited number of
customers for as much as 10% of sales, and the loss of any single customer would
not have a material adverse effect on consolidated revenues or net income of the
Company. Backlog of orders was approximately $85.3 million at February 28, 2002,
$34.8 million at February 28, 2001 and $31.2 million at February 29, 2000. All
of the year-end backlog should be delivered during the next 18 months.

                                       1

<PAGE>

Orders included in the backlog are represented by contracts and purchase orders
that the Company believes to be firm. Total employment in this segment is 839
persons.

Galvanizing Services Segment

The Galvanizing Services Segment provides hot dip galvanizing to the steel
fabrication industry through facilities located throughout the South and
Southwest United States. The eleven galvanizing plants of the Company are
located in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Arizona. Hot
dip galvanizing is a metallurgical process by which molten zinc is applied to a
customer's material. The zinc bonding provides corrosion protection of
fabricated steel for extended periods of up to 50 years. Galvanizing is a highly
competitive business and the Company competes with other independent galvanizing
companies, captive galvanizing facilities operated by manufacturers, and
alternate forms of corrosion protection such as paint. The Company is limited,
to some extent, in its galvanizing market to areas within a close proximity of
its existing locations due to freight cost. Zinc, the principal raw material
used in the galvanizing process, is readily available, but has volatile pricing.
The Company manages its exposure to commodity pricing of zinc by utilizing
contracts with zinc suppliers that include protective caps to guard against
rising commodity prices. This segment typically serves fabricators and/or
manufacturers involved in the highway construction, electrical utility,
transportation, water treatment, agriculture, petrochemical and chemical, pulp
and paper industries, and numerous OEM's. The market in general is broken into
two major categories, being large structural steel projects and custom
fabrication. This segment is not dependent on any single customer or limited
number of customers for as much as 10% of sales, and the loss of any customer
would not have a material adverse effect on consolidated revenues or net income
of the Company. The backlog of galvanizing orders generally is nominal due to
the short time requirement involved in the process. Total employment in this
segment is 416 persons.

General

The Company does not have a material portion of business that may be subject to
renegotiations of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of the government. There were no material amounts spent on research and
development activities during the proceeding three fiscal years.

Environmental

The Company is subject to various environmental protection reviews by state and
federal government agencies. The ultimate liability, if any, which might result
from such reviews or additional clean-up and remediation expenses cannot
presently be determined; however, as a result of an internal analysis and prior
clean-up efforts, management believes the results will not have a material
impact on the Company and that the recorded reserves for estimated losses are
adequate. The Company has reserved $590,000 and $186,000 as of February 28, 2002
and 2001, respectively, for estimated losses related to environmental
liabilities.

In order to maintain permits to operate certain of the Company's facilities,
future capital expenditures for equipment may be required to meet new or
existing environmental regulations.

The Company is involved from time to time in various suits and claims arising in
the normal course of business. In management's opinion, the ultimate resolution
of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
         And Results of Operations

AZZ incorporated (the "Company") operates two distinct segments, Electrical and
Industrial Products Segment and Galvanizing Services Segment. The Electrical and
Industrial Products Segment serves the power generation, transmission and
distribution market as well as the industrial market. The Galvanizing Services
Segment consists of eleven hot dip galvanizing facilities located throughout the
South and Southwest United States that provides a value added galvanizing
service to the steel fabrication industry.

Management believes that the following commentary appropriately discusses and
analyzes the comparative results of operations and the financial conditions of
the Company for the periods covered.

General

For the fiscal year-ended February 28, 2002, the Company recorded record
revenues of $152.9 million compared to the prior year's revenues of $121.4
million. Approximately 68% of the Company's revenues were generated from the
Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and approximately 32% were generated
from the Galvanizing Services Segment. Net income for fiscal 2002 was $7.8
million compared to $8.2 million in the prior fiscal year. Net income as a
percent of sales was 5.1% for fiscal 2002 as compared to 6.7% for fiscal 2001.
The reduction in net income as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower
operating margins in the Company's Galvanizing Services Segment and the
industrial products within the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment. These
lower margins were a result of the overall downturn of the general economy.
Earnings per share decreased by 8% to $1.50 per share for fiscal 2002 compared
to $1.63 per share in the prior fiscal year, on a diluted basis.

Results of Operations

Year ended February 28, 2002 (2002) compared with year ended February 28, 2001
(2001)

Revenues

The Company's consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2002 increased by $31.5
million or 26%, as compared to fiscal 2001.

The Electrical and Industrial Products Segment produces highly engineered
specialty products supplied to the power generation, transmission and
distribution market as well as lighting and tubular products to the industrial
market. The segment recorded record revenues for fiscal 2002 of $103.3 million,
an increase of 50% over the prior year results of $68.9 million. These results
were aided by the acquisitions of Central Electric Company and Carter & Crawley
Inc. on November 1, 2001. These acquisitions reinforce the Company's strategy of
broadening our range of products that we are able to offer to our existing
customer base. Excluding the acquisitions, revenues for the Electrical and
Industrial Products Segment increased 17% to $80.8 million for fiscal 2002. The
Electrical and Industrial Products Segment ended fiscal 2002 with a backlog of
$85.3 million, an increase of 145% from the prior year's backlog of $34.8
million. The backlog excluding acquisitions increased 34% to $46.5 million for
fiscal 2002. The electrical products backlog increased $51.5 million to $81.5
million. Approximately 75% of the $51.5 million increase is associated with the
acquired companies, which ended fiscal 2002 with a backlog of $38.8 million. The
remaining 25% increase is due to the dynamic market in which the existing
electrical products served during fiscal 2002. The industrial products backlog
decreased 21% to $3.8 million due the slow down in the petroleum and industrial
markets as well as the economic downturn in the general economy.

Revenues for this segment's electrical products increased 72% to $80.1 million
for fiscal 2002 as compared to $46.5 million in fiscal 2001. Revenues from the
acquisitions of Central Electric Company and Carter & Crawley, Inc. for four
months of the Company's ownership was $22.4 million. Revenues for the electrical
products excluding the acquisitions was $57.7 million for fiscal 2002, as
compared to $46.5 million in fiscal 2001, an increase of 24%. Increased demand

                                       6

<PAGE>

for these products continued in fiscal 2002 as a result of the need for new
power plants and the upgrading of existing power plants in order to supply
economical and reliable electricity. The Company's prior year's expansions and
acquisitions have enabled it to capitalize on the growth in the power industry
market. Recent developments, which have impacted the capital markets funding for
new projects, have caused delays and cancellations of domestic power plant
construction planned for 2003 and beyond. Even though the current problems in
the power generation industry tempers our short term optimism, the Company
believes the long term need to expand power generation capacity is a basic one
that should resume once the capital markets are sorted out.

Revenues for industrial products of the Electrical and Industrial Products
Segment increased 4% to $23.2 million for fiscal 2002 as compared to $22.4
million for fiscal 2001. The growth was due to increased demand for petroleum
products during the first half of fiscal 2002. The Company was notified in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 that it was being replaced as a supplier of a
product being offered to the automotive industry. This product generated
revenues of $950,000 for fiscal 2002 and $890,000 for fiscal 2001.

The Company's Galvanizing Services Segment, which is made up of eleven hot dip
galvanizing facilities, generated revenues of $49.6 million, a 6% decrease from
the prior year's revenues of $52.5 million. The downturn in the general economy
and the severe downturn of the telecommunication industry contributed to lower
revenues for this segment. This segment historically has closely followed the
direction of the overall industrial segment of the domestic economy.

Operating Income

The Company's consolidated operating income (see note 11 to Note to Consolidated
Financial Statements) increased 4% to $21.8 million in fiscal 2002 as compared
to $20.9 million in fiscal 2001. Increased revenues for the Electrical and
Industrial Segment produced the improvement in operating income for fiscal 2002.
Consolidated operating margins as a percent of sales declined in fiscal 2002 to
14.2% from the previous years operating margins of 17.2% as a result of
declining margins in the Galvanizing Services Segment.

In the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, operating income for fiscal
2002 increased to $14.6 million, an increase of 29% as compared to $11.3 million
in fiscal 2001. These results were aided by acquisitions of Central Electric
Company and Carter & Crawley on November 1, 2001. Excluding the acquisitions,
operating income increased to $13.1 million for fiscal 2002, an increase of 16%,
as compared to $11.3 million in fiscal 2001. Operating margins for this segment
were 14.1% for fiscal 2002 as compared to 16.4% for fiscal 2002.

Operating income for this segment's electrical products increased 45% to $11.2
million for fiscal 2002 as compared to $7.7 million in fiscal 2001. The
acquisitions made on November 1, 2001 contributed operating income of $1.5
million for fiscal 2002. The additional $2 million of increased operating
income, excluding acquisitions, is a result of increased demand for the
segment's electrical systems. Margins for electrical products were 14% for
fiscal 2002 compared to 16.6% for fiscal 2001. The decline in operating margins
is a result of the lower margin products offered by the recent acquisitions as
compared with the Company's existing electrical products.

Operating income for this segment's industrial products decreased 5% to $3.4
million in fiscal 2002 as compared to $3.6 million in fiscal 2001. Operating
margins for industrial products were 14.4% for fiscal 2002 compared to 15.8% in
fiscal 2001. Pricing pressures on these products in order to maintain market
share contributed to lower margins. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 the
Company was notified it was being replaced with an alternative vendor for it's
product offered to the automotive industry. Due to the effects of the loss of
this product and current economic conditions in the industrial market,
management has instituted cost reducing measures.

In the Galvanizing Services Segment, operating income decreased 26% to $7.2
million for fiscal 2002 as compared $9.7 million in fiscal 2001. Operating
margins were 15% for fiscal 2002 as compared to 18% in fiscal 2001. Operating
income and margins were impacted by higher natural gas and zinc costs for the
first half of fiscal 2002. In addition this segment experienced significant
reductions in sales volumes due to the downturn in the general economy. During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, management instituted cost reductions to
offset a portion of the effect of lower sales volumes. As of the end of fiscal
2002 it appears the prices for zinc and natural gas have stabilized.

General Corporate Expense

General corporate expenses for fiscal 2002 were $6.4 million, an increase of 23%
from fiscal 2001. As a percent of sales, general corporate expenses were 4.2%
for fiscal 2002 as compared to 4.3% in fiscal 2001.

Interest expense for fiscal 2002 was $2.4 million, an increase of 3% as compared
to fiscal 2001. The additional debt required to purchase the acquisitions of
Central Electric Company and Carter & Crawley Inc. created the additional
interest expense. A portion of the increased interest costs associated with the
acquisitions was offset by lower variable interest rates.

Provision For Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 38% for fiscal
2002 and 37.7% for fiscal 2001. The increase in the effective tax rate is a
result of higher state taxes and increased non-deductible expenses.

Year ended February 28, 2001 (2001) compared with year ended February 29, 2000
(2000)

Revenues

The Company's consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2001 grew by $28.9 million or
31% over the prior year.

The Electrical and Industrial Products Segment recorded revenues for fiscal 2001
of $68.9 million, an increase of 34% over the prior year results of $51.5
million. These results were aided by the inclusion of a full year of results of
operations associated with the acquisition made on September 1, 1999, which
added to the segment's capacity to manufacture electrical products. The
Electrical and Industrial Products Segment ended fiscal 2001 with a backlog of
$34.8 million, up 12% from the prior year's backlog of $31.2 million. The
backlog increased for both electrical and industrial products. The electrical
products backlog increased $2.4 million to $30 million primarily from inclusion
of backlog in the amount of $4.5 million associated with the acquisition made in
fiscal 2000. The industrial products backlog increased by $1.2 million to $4.8
million due to increased demand from the petroleum industry for the segment's
industrial products.

Revenues for this segment's electrical products increased 40% to $46.5 million
for fiscal 2001 as compared to $33.2 million in fiscal 2000. Approximately 27%
or $3.6 million of the increase is due to inclusion of a full year's operations
of the segment's acquisition made in fiscal 2000. The remainder of the $9.7
million increase, or 73%, was due to increased demand for the segment's
electrical systems that are provided to the power generation industry. These
products continue to benefit from the deregulation of the power industry and
growing need for reliable supplies of electricity throughout the United States.
The Company's recent plant expansions over the past two years have enabled it to
capture more market share through increased capacity. Excluding the fiscal 2000
acquisition, revenues from the sales of electrical products improved by 34% over
the prior year.

Revenues for this segment's industrial products increased 22% to $22.4 million
for fiscal 2001 as compared to $18.3 million in fiscal 2000. The growth is due
to increased demand for the industrial products in the petroleum markets served.
Revenues for the segment's industrial products were also aided by a full year of
business for its two new products for the automotive industry and the retail
lighting markets. Revenues for these two products increased to $1.9 million for
the current year versus $545,000 in the prior year, a 244% increase.

The Company's Galvanizing Services Segment, which is made up of eleven hot dip
galvanizing facilities, generated record revenues of $52.5 million for fiscal
2001, a 28% increase over the prior year's revenues of $41.1 million. The
acquisition of the Company's eleventh galvanizing facility on January 31, 2000
added an additional $8.1 million in revenue for fiscal 2002. Revenues for the
Galvanizing Services Segment excluding the prior year acquisition were $44.4
million in the current fiscal year as compared to $40.4 million in the prior
fiscal year, a 10% increase. This improvement was associated with higher volumes
due to increased demand for galvanized products from pole and tower
manufacturers as well as other areas of the telecommunications industry.

Operating Income

The Company's consolidated operating income (see note 11 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements) increased 27% to $20.9 million in fiscal 2001
as compared to $16.5 million in fiscal 2000. The Company's increased operating
income for fiscal 2001 is the result of increased revenues in both segments of
the Company's business. Consolidated operating margins were 17.2% for fiscal
2001 compared to 17.9% in fiscal 2000 as a result of declining operating margins
in the Galvanizing Services Segment.

In the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, operating income for fiscal
2001 increased to $11.3 million, up 61% from $7 million in fiscal 2000.
Operating margin in this segment improved for fiscal 2002 to 16.3%, a 20%
increase from the prior year's operating margin of 13.6%.

Operating income for this segment's electrical products increased 45% to $7.7
million for fiscal 2001 as compared to $5.3 million in fiscal 2000. The
acquisition made on September 1, 1999 contributed operating income of $1 million
for fiscal 2001 as compared to $227,000 for fiscal 2000. Approximately $1.6
million of the increased operating income is due to the increased demand for the
segments electrical systems. Margins for electrical products were 16.6% for the
current fiscal year compared to 16% in the prior fiscal year. Improved margins
were a result of increased operating efficiencies associated with higher
volumes.

Operating income for this segment's industrial product sales increased 108% to
$3.6 million for fiscal 2001 as compared to $1.7 million for fiscal 2000. The
increase in operating income for these products is due to higher revenues and
improved margins. This group's operating income also benefited from the
increased demand for the two new products first offered in fiscal 2000. The new
products serve the retail lighting market and automotive industry, contributing
$28,000 and $290,000, respectively, to operating income. Operating margins
improved to 15.8% for fiscal 2001 as compared to 9.3% for fiscal 2000 a 70%
increase. The improved margins were a result of increased volumes allowing for
improved efficiencies due to an upturn in the petroleum market, one of the
markets served by these products.

In the Galvanizing Services Segment, operating income increased 2% to $9.7
million for fiscal 2001 from $9.5 million for the prior year. The acquisition of
the Company's eleventh galvanizing facility made on January 31, 2000 had a
positive impact on operating income for fiscal 2001 in the amount of $496,000 as
compared to a loss of $53,000 for the one month of operation in fiscal 2000. The
increase in operating income from the acquisition was offset by increased
operating costs in the other ten facilities. Operating margins for the existing
ten facilities prior to the acquisition decreased to 20.6% in the current fiscal
year as compared to 23.7% the prior fiscal year. The reduced margins were caused
by higher zinc and utility cost. Zinc costs for this segment increased 10% for
the fiscal 2001 year as compared to fiscal 2000. Net utility costs were up
approximately 42% for fiscal 2001 as compared with the prior year. The increase
in utility cost is a result of increased production as well as increased prices
for natural gas.

General Corporate Expenses

General corporate expenses for fiscal 2001 were $5.2 million, up 21% from fiscal
2000. As a percent of sales, general corporate expenses were 4.3% for fiscal
2001 compared to 4.6% in the prior year.

Interest expense for fiscal 2001 was $2.3 million, up 39% or $658,000 from
fiscal 2000. This increase was due to larger average outstanding loan balances
during fiscal 2001 associated with the acquisitions made during the second half
of fiscal 2000.

                                       9

<PAGE>

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 37.7% for
fiscal 2001 and 37.5% for fiscal 2000. The increase in the effective tax rate is
from an increase in non-deductible goodwill associated with the acquisition of
the Company's eleventh galvanizing facility in fiscal 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company has historically met its liquidity and capital resource needs
through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and bank
borrowings. The Company's cash requirements are generally for operating
activities, acquisitions, capital improvements, and debt repayment. The Company
believes that working capital, borrowing capabilities, and funds generated from
operations should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities,
capital improvements, debt repayment and possible future acquisitions.

The Company's operating activities generated cash flows of approximately $14.2
million, $12.4 million, and $13.8 million during fiscal 2002, 2001,and 2000,
respectively. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2002 included net income in
the amount of $7.8 million, depreciation and amortization in the amount of $6.3
million, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities and other increases
in cash flows from operations of $100,000.

Through the use of cash flows and bank debt, the Company made $12.8 million in
capital improvements, which included the construction of a new galvanizing
facility located in Crowley, Texas to replace an outdated facility at the same
location. The Company also purchased 100% of the outstanding stock of Central
Electric Company and the operating assets of Carter & Crawley Inc., net of cash
for a total purchase price of $38.8 million. The breakdown of capital spending
by segment can be found in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Cash dividends were paid early in fiscal 2002 in the amount of
$796,000, but no dividend was declared or paid early in fiscal 2003 and no
resumption of a cash dividend is currently anticipated.

On November 1, 2001, the Company entered into a new syndicated credit facility,
which replaced the previous term notes and revolving line of credit. This
agreement includes a $40 million term facility and a $45 million revolving
credit facility. The revolving credit is contingent on asset-based collateral of
inventories and accounts receivables. The $40 million term note is payable in
$10 million installments over the next four years. At the end of fiscal 2002,
the Company had $40 million outstanding under the term note and $23.5
outstanding on the revolving credit facility. At February 28, 2002, the Company
had approximately $7.9 million available under the revolving credit facility.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to protect against volatile
interest rates and manage interest rate expense. At February 28, 2002, the
Company has a $5.7 million interest rate swap agreement entered into in February
1999 at a fixed rate of 6.8%. The Company has an additional $7.4 million
interest rate swap agreement entered into in April 2000 for a fixed rate of
8.51%. On November 1, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement covering an additional $40 million of debt at a fixed rate of 5.89%.
In conjunction with the Company's new financing agreement the Company
discontinued hedge accounting for the February 1999 and April 2000 interest rate
swaps effective November 1, 2001. At February 28, 2002 the fair value of these
two swaps was a liability of $291,000. The November 2001 interest rate swap,
which was designated as a hedge of the Company's variable rate interest, has an
unrealized loss of $60,000 as of February 28, 2002. The accumulated balance in
other comprehensive income is $241,000, net of tax of $145,000, as of February
28, 2002. This amount will be charged to interest expense over the respective
terms of the three swaps.

The Company's current ratio was 1.70 to 1 at the end of fiscal 2002, as compared
to 1.88 to 1 in fiscal 2001. Shareholder equity grew 26% during fiscal 2002 to
$54.8 million ($10.70 per share). Long-term debt as a percent of shareholders
equity was 98% for fiscal 2002 as compared to 53% in fiscal 2001. The increase
in long-term debt as a percent of shareholder's equity for fiscal 2002 is the
result of additional long-term debt to complete the purchase of the Company's
two acquisitions on November 1, 2001.

Inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company's operations in recent
years; however, the Company attempts to recover any cost increases through
improvements to its manufacturing process and through increases in price where
competitively feasible.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Company to
make estimates that affect the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses. The Company's estimates are based on historical experience and
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, and form the basis for the Company's conclusions. The Company
continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates as the
business and the economic conditions change. The use of estimates is pervasive
throughout the Company's financial statements, but accounting policies and
estimates considered most critical are allowances for doubtful accounts,
accruals for contingent liabilities and revenue recognition. More information
regarding significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts- The carrying value of the accounts receivables
is continually evaluated based on the likelihood of collection. An allowance is
maintained for estimated losses resulting from our customer's inability to make
required payments. The allowance is determined by historical experience of
uncollected accounts, the level of past due accounts, overall level of
outstanding accounts receivables, information about specific customers with
respect of their inability to make payments and future expectations of
conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts receivables. If the
financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in
an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be
required.

Accruals for Contingent Liabilities- The amounts the Company records for claims
such as insurance recoverables, warranty and other contingent liabilities
requires the Company to make judgments regarding the amount of expenses that
will ultimately be incurred. The Company uses past history and experience, as
well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims in evaluating the
amount of liability that should be recorded. Actual results may be different
than the Company's estimates.

Revenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized for the Galvanizing Services segment
upon completion of the galvanizing services or shipment of product. Revenue is
recognized for the Electrical and Industrial Products segment upon shipment of
product or customer receipt of product, or based upon percentage of completion
method as contract services are performed. The extent of progress for revenue
recognized using the percentage of completion method is measured by the ratio of
contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs at completion.
Contract costs include direct labor and material, and certain indirect costs.
Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are made in
the period in which such losses are estimable. The assumptions made in
determining the estimated cost could differ from actual performance resulting in
a different outcome for profits or losses than anticipated.

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141
"Business Combinations", and SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets", (Statement 142) effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and certain intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual
impairment tests in accordance with the Statements. Other intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives.

The Company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, except, as
provided for under Statement 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets resulting from acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001 have not been
amortized. In 2002, the Company recognized $537,000 of tax-deductible goodwill
amortization expense and $702,000 of non-tax deductible goodwill amortization

expected to result in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately

occurring in 2002 that will not occur in 2003. As of March 1, 2002, the Company
performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite
lived intangible assets and has determined that these tests will not have an
effect on the earnings and financial position of the Company.

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143,
"Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2002. This Statement addresses financial accounting and
reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The Company is
currently evaluating the effect, if any, this Statement will have on its
financial statements and related disclosures.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. The new Statement supercedes current accounting guidance
relating to impairment of long-lived assets and provides a single accounting
methodology for long-lived assets to be disposed of, and also supercedes
existing guidance with respect to reporting the effects of the disposal of a
business. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any, this Statement
will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.

Forward Looking Statements

This Report contains, and from time to time the Company or certain of its
representatives may make, "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are generally
identified by the use of words such as "anticipate," "expect," "estimate,"
"intend," "should," "may," "believe," and terms with similar meanings. Although
the Company believes that the current views and expectations reflected in these
forward-looking statements are reasonable, those views and expectations, and the
related statements, are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and other
factors, many of which are not under the Company's control. Those risks,
uncertainties, and other factors could cause the actual results to differ
materially from these in the forward-looking statements. Those risks,
uncertainties, and factors include, but are not limited to, many of the matters
described in this Report: change in demand, prices and raw material cost,
including zinc and natural gas which is used in the hot dip galvanizing process;
changes in the economic conditions of the various markets the Company serves,
foreign and domestic, including the market price for oil and natural gas;
customer requested delay of shipments, acquisition opportunities, adequacy of
financing, and availability of experienced management employees to implement the
Company's growth strategy; and customer demand and response to products and
services offered by the Company. The Company expressly disclaims any obligations
to release publicly any updates or revisions to these forward-looking statements
to reflect any change in its views or expectations. The Company can give no
assurances that such forward-looking statements will prove to be correct.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk relating to the Company's operations results primarily from changes
in interest rates and commodity prices. The Company has only limited involvement
with derivative financial instruments and is not a party to any leveraged
derivatives.

The Company manages its exposures to changes in interest rates by optimizing the
use of variable and fixed rate debt. The Company had approximately $23.6 million
of variable rate borrowings at February 28, 2002 after its hedges. In November
2001, the Company entered into a interest rate protection agreement with its
lender to modify the interest characteristics of $40 million of debt from
variable rate to a fixed rate. In conjunction with the Company's new financing
agreement the Company discontinued hedge accounting for the February 1999 and
April 2000 interest rate swaps effective November 1, 2001. At February 28, 2002
the fair value of these two swaps was a liability of $291,000. The November 2001
interest rate swap, which was designated as a hedge of the Company's variable
rate interest, has an unrealized loss of $60,000 as of February 28, 2002. The
accumulated balance in other comprehensive income is $241,000, net of tax of
$145,000, as of February 28, 2002. This amount will be charged

                                       12

<PAGE>

to interest expense over the respective terms of the three swaps. The Company
believes it has adequately protected itself from increased interest cost under
these financial arrangements.

The Company manages its exposures to commodity prices, primarily zinc used in
its Galvanizing Services Segment, by utilizing contracts with its zinc suppliers
that include protective caps to guard against rising commodity prices.
Management believes these contractual agreements ensure adequate supplies and
partial offset against exposure to commodity price swings.

The Company does not believe that a hypothetical change of 10% of the interest
rate currently in effect or a change of 10% of commodity prices would have a
significantly adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors

Board of Directors and Shareholders
AZZ incorporated

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AZZ incorporated
as of February 28, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of
income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended February 28, 2002. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AZZ incorporated
at February 28, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 28,
2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

AZZ incorporated NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.     Summary of significant accounting policies

       Organization--AZZ incorporated (the Company) operates primarily in the
       ------------
       United States. Information about the Company's operations by segment is
       included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

       Basis of consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include the
       ----------------------
       accounts of AZZ incorporated and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
       significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated
       in consolidation.

       Use of estimates--The preparation of the financial statements in
       ----------------
       conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
       States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
       the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
       and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
       amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
       results could differ from those estimates.

       Concentrations of credit risk--Financial instruments that potentially
       -----------------------------
       subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
       principally of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and
       interest rate swaps. See further discussion on the credit risk associated
       with the interest rate swaps under "Derivative Financial Instruments."

       The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various financial
       institutions. These financial institutions are located throughout the
       United States and Company policy is designed to limit exposure to any one
       institution. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative
       credit standing of those financial institutions that are considered in
       the Company's banking relationships. The Company has not experienced any
       losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant
       credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents.

       Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable
       are limited due to the Company's diversity by virtue of two operating
       segments, the number of customers, and the absence of a concentration of
       trade accounts receivable in a small number of customers. The Company's
       net credit losses in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately $204,000,
       $219,000 and $168,000, respectively. Collateral is usually not required
       from customers as a condition of sale.

       Revenue recognition--The Company recognizes revenue for the Galvanizing
       -------------------
       Services segment upon completion of galvanizing services or shipment of
       product. Revenue for the Electrical and Industrial Products segment is
       recognized upon shipment of product or customer receipt of product, or
       based upon the percentage-of-completion method of accounting as contract
       services are performed. The extent of progress for revenue recognized
       using the percentage-of-completion method is measured by the ratio of
       contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs at
       completion. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of related billings on
       uncompleted contracts are recorded as current assets and billings in
       excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are
       recorded as current liabilities. Contract costs include all direct
       material and labor, and certain indirect costs. Selling, general and
       administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for
       estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are made in the period
       in which such losses are estimable.

       Cash and cash equivalents--For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and
       -------------------------
       cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits with banks and all highly
       liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

       Inventories--Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost
       -----------
       is determined principally using a weighted-average method for the
       Electrical and Industrial Products segment and the first-in-first-out
       (FIFO) method for the Galvanizing Services segment.

1.     Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

       Property, plant and equipment -- For financial reporting purposes,
       -----------------------------
       depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated
       useful lives of the related assets as follows:

                         Buildings and structures                10-25 years
                         Machinery and equipment                  3-15 years
                         Furniture and fixtures                   3-15 years
                         Automotive equipment                        3 years

       Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; renewals and
       betterments are capitalized.

       Intangible assets and goodwill -- Intangible assets include purchased
       ------------------------------
       intangibles primarily comprised of customer lists, backlogs and
       non-compete agreements. Such intangible assets and goodwill, which
       resulted from acquisitions completed on or before June 30, 2001, are
       being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
       lives of the assets ranging from two to forty years. Goodwill and
       intangible assets with indefinite lives related to acquisitions
       subsequent to June 30, 2001 will no longer be amortized in accordance
       with SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (see New
       Accounting Pronouncements below).

       Impairment of long-lived assets -- The Company reviews long-lived assets
       -------------------------------
       and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or
       changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset is
       impaired. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
       comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated fair
       value, based on future net cash flows expected to be generated by the
       asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment
       recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
       assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Management assesses whether
       there has been an impairment of goodwill by considering factors such as
       expected future operating income, current operating results and other
       economic factors (see New Accounting Pronouncements below).

       Debt Origination Costs - Debt origination costs are amortized using the
       ----------------------
       effective interest rate method. Debt origination costs, net of
       accumulated amortization, were $886,000 and $0 at February 28, 2002 and
       2001, respectively.

       Income taxes -- Income tax expense is based on the liability method.
       ------------
       Under this method of accounting, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
       recognized based on differences between financial accounting and income
       tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates and
       laws.

       Stock-based compensation -- The Company grants stock options for a fixed
       ------------------------
       number of shares to employees and directors with an exercise price equal
       to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The Company follows
       Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
       to Employees (APB 25), and related interpretations in accounting for
       employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the
       Company's employee and director stock options equal the market price of
       the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
       recognized.

       Financial instruments -- The Company's financial instruments consist of
       ---------------------
       cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, long-term debt and
       interest rate swaps. The fair value of financial instruments is
       determined by reference to various market data and other valuation
       techniques as appropriate. Unless otherwise disclosed, the fair value of
       financial instruments approximates their recorded values.

                                       21

AZZ incorporated NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.     Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

       The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage variable interest rate
       risk associated with portions of its long-term debt. The fair value of
       interest rate swap agreements is based on quotes obtained from financial
       institutions. Information about the Company's swap agreements is included
       in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

       Derivative financial instruments--From time to time, the Company uses
       --------------------------------
       derivatives to manage interest rate risk. The Company's policy is to use
       derivatives for risk management purposes only, which includes maintaining
       the ratio between the Company's fixed and floating rate debt obligations
       that management deems appropriate, and prohibits entering into such
       contracts for trading purposes. The Company enters into derivatives only
       with counterparties (primarily financial institutions) which have
       substantial financial wherewithal to minimize credit risk. The amount of
       gains or losses from the use of derivative financial instruments has not
       been and is not expected to be material to the Company's consolidated
       financial statements.

       Change in Accounting Principle
       ------------------------------

       As of March 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
       Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
       Instruments and Hedging Activities," which was amended by SFAS No. 138,
       "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
       Activities," (collectively Statement 133). As amended, Statement 133
       establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
       instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
       contracts, and for hedging activities. The Statement requires that an
       entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the
       balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in the
       fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized
       periodically in income or in stockholders' equity as a component of
       comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative financial
       instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it
       qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. The ineffective
       portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately
       recognized in earnings. At March 1, 2001, the Company's derivatives
       consisted of two interests rate swap agreements, which qualified for
       hedge accounting.

       The Company accounted for the adoption of Statement 133 as a cumulative
       effect of a change in accounting principle. The adoption of Statement 133
       resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment net of tax of $185,000, which
       was recognized as a charge to cumulative other comprehensive income
       (equity). The offsetting fair value of the interest rate swaps was
       recognized in accrued liabilities. Through October 31, 2001, an
       additional $164,000 was accrued in association with these swaps. In
       conjunction with the Company's new financing (see Note 9), the Company
       discontinued hedge accounting for these two swaps effective November 1,
       2001. At February 28, 2002 the fair market value of these two swaps was a
       liability of $291,000. The Company entered into a new interest rate swap
       in November 2001, which was designated as a hedge of the Company's
       variable rate interest exposure and has an unrealized fair value loss of
       $60,000 as of February 28, 2002. The accumulated balance in other
       comprehensive income is $241,000, net of tax of $145,000, as of February
       28, 2002. This amount will be charged to interest expense over the
       respective terms of the three swaps.

       New accounting pronouncements
       -----------------------------

       In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
       141 "Business Combinations", and SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other
       Intangible Assets", (Statement 142) effective for fiscal years beginning
       after December 15, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and intangible
       assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but
       will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the
       Statements. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over
       their useful lives.

AZZ incorporated NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.     Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

       The Company will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other
       intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, except,
       as provided for under Statement 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived
       intangible assets resulting from acquisitions completed after June 30,
       2001 will not be amortized (See Note 13). In fiscal 2002, the Company
       recognized $537,000 of tax-deductible goodwill amortization expense and
       $702,000 of non-tax deductible goodwill amortization expense. Application
       of the non-amortization provisions of Statement 142 is expected to result
       in an increase in income before income taxes of approximately $1,239,000
       in 2003 based on goodwill amortization occurring in 2002 that will not
       occur in 2003. As of March 1, 2002, the Company performed the first of
       the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible
       assets and has determined that these tests will not have an effect on the
       earnings and financial position of the Company.

       In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
       143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective for fiscal
       years beginning after June 15, 2002. This Statement addresses financial
       accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the
       retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
       retirement costs. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if any,
       this Statement will have on its financial statements and related
       disclosures.

       In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the
       Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," effective for fiscal years
       beginning after December 15, 2001. The new Statement supercedes current
       accounting guidance relating to impairment of long-lived assets and
       provides a single accounting methodology for long-lived assets to be
       disposed of, and also supercedes existing guidance with respect to
       reporting the effects of the disposal of a business. The Company is
       currently evaluating the effect, if any, this Statement will have on its
       financial statements and related disclosures.

2.     Inventories

       Inventories consist of the following:

6.     Income taxes

       Deferred federal and state income taxes reflect the net tax effects of
       temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
       liabilities for financial accounting purposes and the amounts used for
       income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company's net deferred
       income tax asset are as follows:

7.     Earnings per share

       Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of
       shares outstanding during each year. Diluted earnings per share were
       similarly computed but have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of the
       weighted average number of stock options outstanding.

7.     Earnings per share (continued)

       Stock options for which the exercise price was greater than the average
       market price of common shares were not included in the computation of
       diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. At the
       end of fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, there were 129,514, none and
       229,487 stock options, respectively, outstanding with exercise prices
       greater than the average market price of common shares.

       Cash dividends paid per share were $0.16, $0.16 and $0.12 in 2002, 2001
       and 2000, respectively.

8.     Stock options and other shareholder matters

       During fiscal 2002, the Company adopted the AZZ incorporated 2001
       Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2001 plan"). The purpose of the plan is to
       promote the growth and prosperity of the Company by permitting the
       Company to grant to its employees, directors and advisors restricted
       stock and options to purchase common stock of the Company. The maximum
       number of shares that may be issued under this plan is 750,000 shares. In
       conjunction with the adoption of the 2001 plan, all options still
       available for issuance under pre-existing option plans were terminated.
       At February 28, 2002, options outstanding under this plan amounted to
       103,264 of which 17,753 are vested and exercisable at prices ranging from
       $19.80 to $24.25 per share. Options under this plan vest from immediately
       upon issuance to ratably over a period of three to five years and expire
       at various dates through November 2011.

       In addition to the 2001 Plan, the Company has options that were issued
       but not exercised under the 1998 Incentive Stock Option Plan, (the "1998
       Plan"). The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the plan
       was 750,000 shares, prior to the adoption of the 2001 Plan. The 1998 Plan
       was amended to withdraw 508,100 options and the common stock underlying
       those options on February 28, 2002. At February 28, 2002, options
       outstanding under this plan amounted to 128,436 of which 124,436 options
       are vested and exercisable at prices ranging from $8.88 to $17.84 per
       share. Options under this plan vest from immediately upon issuance to
       ratably over a period of five years and expire at various dates through
       March 2006.

       In addition to the 2001 Plan, the Company has options that were issued
       but not exercised under the 1991 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan, (the
       "1991 Plan") and the 1997 Non-Statutory Stock Option Grants, (the"1997
       Grants"). The maximum number of shares that may be issued under these
       plans were 157,500 shares for the 1991 Plan and 70,000 shares for the
       1997 Grants, prior to the adoption of the 2001 Plan. The 1991 Plan
       expired prior to the adoption of the 2001 Plan. At February 28, 2002,
       options granted and outstanding under these plans amounted to 53,500 of
       which 51,400 options are vested and exercisable at prices ranging from
       $11.125 to $16.88 per share. Options under these plans vest ratably over
       a five-year period and expire at various dates through July 2008.

       In February 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with a company to
       issue 70,000 stock options in exchange for services received and to be
       received. These options vested over a period of eighteen months
       contingent upon the achievement of certain performance measures. As of
       February 28, 2001, 38,500 options had vested under this plan and the
       remaining 31,500 unvested options were to vest in three separate groups
       over six months following February 28, 2001 contingent upon the Company
       meeting certain performance goals. During fiscal 2002 an additional
       19,250 shares vested under this plan with 7,000 of the vested shares
       being exercised in fiscal 2002. In August 2001, the Company amended the
       February 2000 plan to allow for the remaining 12,250 unvested options to
       vest over an additional eighteen-month period contingent upon the

       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting
       for Stock Based Compensation, requires the disclosure of pro forma net
       income and income per share of common stock computed as if the Company
       had accounted for its stock options under the fair value method set forth
       in SFAS 123. The fair value of stock options granted was estimated at the
       date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
       following weighted average assumptions: a risk-free interest rate ranging
       from 5% to 6.5%, a dividend yield ranging from 1% to 1.25% and a
       volatility factor ranging from 0.367 to 0.498. In addition, the fair
       value of these options was estimated based on an expected life ranging
       from 1 1/2 years to 6 years.

8.     Stock options and other shareholder matters (continued)

       The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
       estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting
       restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation
       models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
       expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's stock options have
       characteristics significantly different from those described above, and
       because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
       the fair value estimate, in management's opinion the existing models do
       not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of fair value for the
       Company's stock options.

       For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
       options is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the
       option's vesting period as adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The
       Company's pro forma information for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000 using the
       fair value method is as follows:

       As of February 28, 2001, the Company has approximately 1,001,936 and
       17,693,484 shares, respectively reserved for future issuance under the
       stock option plans and shareholder rights plan.

       Effective January 7, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a stock rights
       plan, which authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one right
       for each share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on
       February 4, 1999. The rights are exercisable at an initial exercise price
       of $60, subject to certain adjustments as defined in the agreement, if a
       person or group acquires 15% or more of the Company's common stock or
       announces a tender offer that would result in ownership of 15% or more of
       the common stock. Alternatively, the rights may be redeemed at one cent
       per right at any time until ten business days following the first public
       announcement of the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 15% of the
       Company's common stock. The rights expire on January 7, 2009.

9.      Long-term debt (continued)

        On November 1, 2001, the Company entered into a new syndicated credit
        facility, which replaced the previous term notes and revolving line of
        credit. This agreement includes a $40 million term facility and a $45
        million revolving credit facility.

        Interest on borrowings under the term note and revolving line of credit
        bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of the base rate
        plus applicable margin for the base rate borrowings for the applicable
        facility, or the adjusted eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin for
        eurodollar rate borrowings for the applicable facility. The applicable
        margin range is based on the leverage ratio, which was 2.25% at February
        28, 2002 and correlated to an interest rate of 5.89% on the term note
        and 4.44% on the revolving line of credit at February 28, 2002.
        Additionally, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee based on
        the leverage ratio at a rate ranging from .25% to .5% on the unused
        revolving credit facility,

        The Company's credit facility and industrial revenue bonds are subject
        to loan agreements, which require the Company to comply with various
        financial covenants including minimum requirements with regard to
        consolidated net worth, leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and
        capital expenditures. The Company's long-term debt is secured by
        substantially all of the assets of the Company. Under the terms of the
        credit facility, borrowing's on the revolving line of credit are subject
        to a borrowing base calculation which is limited to 85% of certain trade
        accounts receivable and a range of 50% to 60% of certain raw materials
        and finished good inventories and is reduced by the balance of
        outstanding letters of credit which may not exceed $5 million at any one
        time. At February 28, 2002, the Company has approximately $7,858,000
        available under the revolving credit facility after deducting $851,000
        of outstanding letters of credit.

        In order to manage interest rate expense, the Company has entered into
        interest rate protection agreements (the Swap Agreements) to modify its
        interest characteristics from a variable rate to a fixed rate. The
        February 1999 swap agreement involves the exchange of interest
        obligations from February 1999 through February 2006 whereby the Company
        pays a fixed rate of 6.8% in exchange for a variable 30-day LIBOR plus
        1.25% (3.08% at February 28, 2002). At the end of February 2002 the
        notional amount of this swap was $5.7 million. The April 2000 swap
        agreement involves the exchange of interest obligations from April 2000
        through April 2002 whereby the Company pays a fixed rate of 8.51% in
        exchange for a variable 30-day LIBOR plus 1.25% (3.08% at February 28,
        2002). At the end of February 2002 the notional amount of this swap was
        $7.4 million. In conjunction with the Company's new financing, the
        Company discontinued hedge accounting for these two swaps effective
        November 1, 2001. The November 2001 swap agreement involves the exchange
        of interest rate obligations from November 2001 through November 2005
        whereby the Company pays a fixed rate of 5.89% in exchange for a
        variable 30-day LIBOR rate plus 2.25% (4.08% at February 28, 2002). At
        the end of February 2002 there was $40 million of debt covered by this
        swap agreement. The amount of debt covered by the November 2001 swap
        agreement reduces on the same amortization schedule as the $40 million
        term facility as defined by the loan agreement. Management intends to
        hold the swaps until their maturities in April 2002, February 2006, and
        November 2005, respectively. The fair value of the February 1999, April
        2000 and November 2001 swap agreements is approximately $(225,000),
        $(65,000), and $(60,000), respectively, at February 28, 2002.

        Maturities of long-term debt are as follows (in thousands):

                          2003                         $10,045

       $1,421,000, $1,003,000, and $800,000 for the years ended February 28,
       2002, February 28, 2001 and February 29, 2000, respectively, and includes
       all short-term as well as long-term rental agreements.

       Litigation and Environmental Contingencies

       The Company is subject to various environmental protection reviews by
       state and federal government agencies. The ultimate liability, if any,
       which might result from such reviews or additional clean-up and
       remediation expenses cannot presently be determined; however, as a result
       of an internal analysis and prior clean-up efforts, management believes
       the results will not have a material impact on the Company and that the
       recorded reserves for estimated losses are adequate. The Company has
       reserved $590,000 and $186,000 as of February 28, 2002 and 2001,
       respectively, for estimated losses related to environmental liabilities.

       In order to maintain permits to operate certain of the Company's
       facilities, future capital expenditures for equipment may be required to
       meet new or existing environmental regulations.

       The Company is involved from time to time in various suits and claims
       arising in the normal course of business. In management's opinion, the
       ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on
       the Company's financial position or results of operations.

13.    Acquisitions

       On November 1, 2001, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock
       of Central Electric Company (CEC), headquartered in Fulton, Missouri. CEC
       is comprised of three operations consisting of a metal clad switchgear
       facility in Fulton, Missouri, a power center operation in Tulsa, Oklahoma
       and a relay panel and non-segmented bus-duct operation in Nashville,
       Tennessee. The consolidated annual revenues of CEC are expect to be
       approximately $50 million. The cost of the acquisition was $28.5 million
       including transaction costs. The acquisition was paid for with $26.7
       million of cash; $1.8 million in AZZ incorporated stock (97,297 shares of
       common stock), which was valued based upon the average value of the stock
       at the time of the public announcement of the acquisition. The operating
       assets acquired included $1.2 million in cash. The acquisition resulted
       in non-tax deductible goodwill of $15.4 million. The goodwill is reported
       with the Industrial and Electrical Products Segment. Acquired intangible
       assets of $885,000, consisted of a $583,000

                                       32

13.    Acquisitions (continued)

       non-compete with a previous owner and $302,000 for the acquired backlog.
       The weighted-average period for amortization of these intangible assets
       is approximately three years. The previous owner guaranteed all
       outstanding accounts receivable as of the closing date of November 1,
       2001 and $500,000 was set-up in escrow to cover any potential bad debt
       for the acquired accounts receivable.

       On November 1, 2001, the Company also acquired the operating assets of
       Carter & Crawley, Inc., headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina for
       $15.4 million in cash including transaction costs. The operating assets
       acquired included $2.2 million in cash. Carter & Crawley, Inc. designs,
       manufactures and installs relay panels and custom control systems for
       utilities and industrial manufactures. The annual revenues of Carter &
       Crawley are expected to be approximately $20 million. The acquisition
       resulted in tax-deductible goodwill of approximately $8 million. The
       goodwill is reported with the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment.

       The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets
       acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition November
       1, 2001:

       twelve-month periods ended February 28, 2002 and 2001, the incentive plan
       expense net of tax was $520,000 and $1 million, respectively. This

13.    Acquisitions (continued)

       In September 1999 and February 2000, the Company purchased CGIT and
       Westside Galvanizing, respectively. The total purchase price, net of cash
       acquired, for these two businesses was approximately $13 million and
       $10.6 million, respectively, and comprised of cash paid of $10.9 million
       and $9.9 million and liabilities assumed of $2.1 million and $752,000,
       respectively. The assets purchased were recorded at estimated fair value
       and the costs in excess of fair value for these acquisitions of
       approximately $7.3 million and $5.7 million were recorded as goodwill.
       Pursuant to the provisions of the purchase agreement for CGIT, the
       Company received from the seller purchase price refunds approximating
       $371,000 during fiscal 2002.

       These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
       accounting. Operations applicable to acquired businesses are included in
       the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income from their respective
       dates of acquisitions. The pro forma consolidated results of operations
       for the year ended February 29, 2000, assuming the acquisitions had been
       consummated as of March 1, 1999 are as follows:
