                                    PART I

Item 1.   Business

AZZ incorporated ("AZZ" or the "Company") was established in 1956 and
incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas. The Company is an electrical
equipment and components manufacturer serving the global growth markets of power
generation, transmission and distribution, and industrial markets as well as a
leading provider of hot dip galvanizing services to the steel fabrication market
nationwide.

The Company offers products through two distinct business segments, Electrical
and Industrial Products Segment, previously known as the Manufactured Products
Segment, and the Galvanizing Services Segment, previously known as the Services
Segment.

The Company changed its name from Aztec Manufacturing Co. to AZZ incorporated on
July 10, 2000. The Company believes the new name will more effectively represent
the scope of its business beyond manufacturing, reflect the changes in the
Company over the past 10 years and better enable it to cross-leverage its
marketing opportunities through the use of a common name and new image.

Electrical and Industrial Products Segment

The Electrical and Industrial Products Segment produces highly engineered
specialty electrical products as well as lighting and tubular products. The
Company markets and sells its products throughout the global market place. The
electrical portion of this segment designs, manufactures, and configures
products that distribute electrical power to a generator, transformer, switching
device or other electrical configurations. These electrical systems are supplied
to the power generation, transmission and distribution markets. Also provided by
this segment are industrial lighting and tubular products used for petrochemical
and industrial applications. Lighting products are provided to the petroleum,
food processing, and power generation industries, to consumer retail outlets and
to industries with unique lighting challenges. The principal markets for tubular
products are the petroleum and automotive industries. The markets for the
Company's Electrical and Industrial Products Segment are highly competitive and
consist of a few large national companies, as well as numerous small
independents. Competition is based primarily on product quality, range of
product line, price and service. While some of these companies are much larger
and better financed than the Company, the Company believes that it can compete
favorably with them. Copper, aluminum and steel are the primary raw materials
used in this segment and are readily available. This segment's products are sold
though manufacturers' representatives and its internal sales force. This segment
is not dependent on any single customer or limited number of customers for as
much as 10% of sales, and the loss of any single customer would not have a
material adverse effect on consolidated revenues of the Company. Backlog of
orders was approximately $34.8 million at February 28, 2001, $31.2 million at
February 29, 2000, and $18.2 million at February 28, 1999. All of the year-end
backlog should be delivered in the next 18 months. Orders included in the
backlog are represented by contracts and purchase orders that the Company
believes to be firm. Total employment in this segment is 445 persons.

Galvanizing Services Segment

The Galvanizing Services Segment provides hot dip galvanizing to the steel
fabrication industry through facilities located throughout the South and
Southwest United States. The eleven galvanizing plants of the Company are
located in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Arizona. Hot
dip galvanizing is a metallurgical process by which molten zinc is applied to a
customer's material. The zinc bonding provides corrosion protection of
fabricated steel for extended periods of up to 50 years. Galvanizing is a highly
competitive business and the Company competes with other independent galvanizing
companies, captive galvanizing facilities operated by manufacturers, and
alternate forms of corrosion protection such as paint. The Company is limited,
to some extent, in its galvanizing market to areas within a close proximity of
its existing locations due to freight cost. Zinc, the principal raw material
used in the galvanizing process, is readily available, but has volatile pricing.
The Company manages its exposure to commodity pricing of zinc by utilizing
contracts with zinc suppliers that include protective caps to guard against
rising commodity prices. This segment typically serves fabricators and/or
manufacturers

                                       2
<PAGE>

involved in the highway construction, electrical utility, transportation, water
treatment, agriculture, petrochemical and chemical, pulp and paper industries,
and numerous OEM's. The market in general is broken into two major categories,
being large structural steel projects and custom fabrication. This segment is
not dependent on any single customer or limited number of customers for as much
as 10% of sales, and the loss of any customer would not have a material adverse
effect on consolidated revenues of the Company. The backlog of galvanizing
orders generally is nominal due to the short time requirement involved in the
process. Total employment in this segment is 452 persons.

General


The Company does not have a material portion of business that may be subject to
renegotiations of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of the government. There were no material amounts spent on research and
development activities during the proceeding three fiscal years. The Company has
been under review by the New York Stock Exchange for compliance with its
continued listing requirements but is confident that its common stock will
continue to be traded on that exchange.


Environmental


In the course of its galvanizing operations, the Company is subject to
occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to noise, air
emissions and water discharges into the environment. As part of its continuing
environmental program, the Company has complied with such proceedings and orders
without any materially adverse effect on its business.

The Company provides for costs related to contingencies when a loss is probable
and the amount is reasonably determinable. It is the opinion of management,
based on past experience, that the ultimate resolution of these contingencies,
to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a materially adverse
effect on the Company.

General

For the fiscal year-ended February 28, 2001, the Company recorded record
revenues of $121.4 million compared to the prior year's revenues of $92.5
million. Approximately 57% of the Company's revenues were generated from the
Electrical and Industrial Products Segment and approximately 43% were generated
from the Galvanizing Service Segment. Net income for fiscal 2001 was $8.2
million compared to $6.6 million in the prior fiscal year. Net income as a
percent of sales was 6.7% for fiscal 2001 as compared to 7.1% for fiscal 2000.
The reduction in net income as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher
interest cost associated with the Company's prior year acquisition activity as
well as lower operating margins in the Company's Galvanizing Services Segment.
Earnings per share increased by 18% to $1.63 per share for fiscal 2001 compared
to $1.38 per share in the prior fiscal year, on a diluted basis. A discussion
concerning effects of new accounting standards can be found in note 1 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.


Results of Operations

Year ended February 28, 2001 (2001) compared with year ended February 29, 2000
(2000)

Revenues

The Company's consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2001 grew by $28.9 million or
31% over the prior year.

The Electrical and Industrial Products Segment produces highly engineered
specialty products supplied to the power generation, transmission and
distribution market as well as lighting and tubular products to the industrial
market. This segment recorded record revenues for fiscal 2001 of $68.9 million,
an increase of 34% over the prior year results of $51.5 million. These results
were aided by the inclusion of a full year of results of operations associated
with the acquisition made on September 1, 1999, which added to the segment's
capacity to manufacture electrical products. The Electrical and Industrial
Products Segment ended fiscal 2001 with a backlog of $34.8 million, up 12% from
the prior year's backlog of $31.2 million. The backlog increased for both
electrical and industrial products. The electrical products backlog increased
$2.4 million to $30 million primarily from inclusion of backlog in the amount of
$4.5 million associated with the acquisition made in fiscal 2000. The industrial
products backlog increased by $1.2 million to $4.8 million due to increased
demand from the petroleum industry for the segment's industrial products.

Revenues for this segment's electrical products increased 40% to $46.5 million
for fiscal 2001 as compared to $33.2 million in fiscal 2000. Approximately 27%
or $3.6 million of the increase is due to inclusion of a full year's operations
of the segment's acquisition made in fiscal 2000. The remainder of the $9.7
million increase, or 73%, was due to increased demand for the segment's
electrical systems that are provided to the power generation industry. These
products continue to benefit from the deregulation of the power industry and
growing need for reliable supplies of electricity throughout the United States.
The Company's recent plant expansions over the past two years have enabled it to
capture more market share through increased capacity. Excluding the fiscal 2000
acquisition, revenues from the sales of electrical products improved by 34% over
the prior year.

Revenues for this segment's industrial products increased 22% to $22.4 million
for fiscal 2001 as compared to $18.3 million in fiscal 2000. The growth is due
to increased demand for the industrial products in the petroleum markets served.
Revenues for the segment's industrial products were also aided by a full year of
business for its two new products for the automotive industry and the retail
lighting markets. Revenues for these two products increased to $1.9 million for
the current year versus $545,000 in the prior year, a 244% increase.

The Company's Galvanizing Services Segment, which is made up of eleven hot dip
galvanizing facilities, generated record revenues of $52.5 million, a 28%
increase over the prior year's revenues of $41.1 million. The acquisition of the
Company's eleventh galvanizing facility on January 31, 2000 added an additional
$8.1 million in revenue for fiscal 2001. Revenues for the Galvanizing Services
Segment excluding the prior year acquisition were $44.4 million

                                       7
<PAGE>

in the current fiscal year as compared to $40.4 million in the prior fiscal
year, a 10% increase. This improvement was associated with higher volumes due to
increased demand for galvanized products from pole and tower manufacturers as
well as other areas of the telecommunications industry.

Operating Income

The Company's consolidated operating income (see note 12 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements) increased 27% to $20.9 million in fiscal 2001
as compared to $16.5 million in fiscal 2000. The Company's increased operating
income for fiscal 2001 is the result of increased revenues in both segments of
the Company's business. Consolidated operating margins were 17.2% for fiscal
2001 compared to 17.9% in fiscal 2000 as a result of declining operating margins
in the Galvanizing Services Segment.

In the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, operating income for fiscal
2001 increased to $11.2 million, up 61% from $7 million in fiscal 2000.
Operating margin in this segment improved for fiscal 2001 to 16.3%, a 20%
increase from the prior year's operating margin of 13.6%.

Operating income for this segment's electrical products increased 45% to $7.7
million for fiscal 2001 as compared to $5.3 million in fiscal 2000. The
acquisition made on September 1, 1999 contributed operating income of $1 million
for fiscal 2001 as compared to $227,000 for fiscal 2000. Approximately $1.6
million of the increased operating income is due to the increased demand for the
segments electrical systems. Margins for electrical products were 16.6% for the
current fiscal year compared to 16% in the prior fiscal year. Improved margins
were a result of increased operating efficiencies associated with higher
volumes.

Operating income for this segment's industrial product sales increased 108% to
$3.5 million for fiscal 2001 as compared to $1.7 million for fiscal 2000. The
increase in operating income for these products is due to higher revenues and
improved margins. This group's operating income also benefited from the
increased demand for the two new products first offered in fiscal 2000. The new
products serve the retail lighting market and automotive industry, contributing
$28,000 and $290,000, respectively, to operating income. Operating margins
improved to 15.8% for fiscal 2001 as compared to 9.3% for fiscal 2000 a 70%
increase. The improved margins were a result of increased volumes allowing for
improved efficiencies due to an upturn in the petroleum market, one of the
markets served by these products.

In the Galvanizing Services Segment, operating income increased 2% to $9.7
million for fiscal 2001 from $9.5 million for the prior year. The acquisition of
the Company's eleventh galvanizing facility made on January 31, 2000 had a
positive impact on operating income for fiscal 2001 in the amount of $496,000 as
compared to a loss of $53,000 for the one month of operation in fiscal 2000. The
increase in operating income from the acquisition was offset by increased
operating costs in the other ten facilities. Operating margins for the existing
ten facilities prior to the acquisition decreased to 20.6% in the current fiscal
year as compared to 23.7% the prior fiscal year. The reduced margins were caused
by higher zinc and utility cost. Zinc costs for this segment increased 10% for
the fiscal 2001 year as compared to fiscal 2000. Net utility costs were up
approximately 42% for fiscal 2001 as compared with the prior year. The increase
in utility cost is a result of increased production as well as increased prices
for natural gas.

General Corporate Expenses

General corporate expenses for fiscal 2001 were $5.2 million, up 21% from fiscal
2000. As a percent of sales, general corporate expenses were 4.3% for fiscal
2001 compared to 4.6% in the prior year.

Interest expense for fiscal 2001 was $2.3 million, up 39% or $658,000 from
fiscal 2000. This increase was due to larger average outstanding loan balances
during fiscal 2001 associated with the acquisitions made during the second half
of fiscal 2000.

Other income and expense consists of scrap sales and other (income) expense
items not specifically identifiable to a segment.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 37.7% for
fiscal 2001 and 37.5% for fiscal 2000. The increase in the effective tax rate is
from an increase in non-deductible goodwill associated with the acquisition of
the Company's eleventh galvanizing facility in fiscal 2000.

Year ended February 29, 2000 (2000) compared with year ended February 28, 1999
(1999)

Revenues

The Company's consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2000 grew by $11.6 million or
14% over the prior year.

The Electrical and Industrial Products Segment recorded revenues for fiscal 2000
of $51.5 million an increase of 11% over fiscal 1999 results of $46.4 million.
These results were aided by the inclusion of six months of operations associated
with an acquisition made on September 1, 1999. The acquisition added revenue of
$4.6 million for its six months of operations for fiscal 2000. The Electrical
and Industrial Products Segment ended fiscal 2000 with a backlog of $31.2
million, up 71% from the prior years backlog of $18.2 million. The backlog
increased for both electrical and industrial products for the segment. The
largest increase came from electrical products with an increase of 69% or $11.3
million to close the year with a backlog of $27.5 million. The acquisition
contributed $2.3 million to the ending backlog while the Company's existing
electrical products contributed $9 million of the increase. The existing
electrical products before the acquisition all benefited from increased domestic
demand of these products due to the deregulation of the power industries and the
need for more power plants in order to meet increasing demand for reliable
electricity. The backlog for industrial products increased 89% or $1.7 million
for fiscal 2000 to end the year with a backlog $3.7 million. The industrial
products backlog increased due to higher demand for these products associated
with the upturn of the petroleum market during the last quarter of fiscal 2000.

Revenues for this segment's electrical products increased 40% to $33.2 million
for fiscal 2000 as compared to $23.8 million in fiscal 1999. Approximately 50%
or $4.6 million of the increase is due to the added capacity associated with the
segment's fiscal 2000 acquisition. The remaining 50% or $4.8 million of the
increase is due to increased demand for the segments electrical systems that are
provided to the power generation industry. Increased demand of these products
continued in fiscal 2000 due to the deregulation of the power industry and the
increased demand for reliable electricity. The Company completed the expansion
of an electrical products facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2000,
which increased capacity and allowed the company to capitalize on the dynamic
power industry market. Revenues increased for the electrical products excluding
the fiscal 2000 acquisition by 20% over the prior year.

Revenues for industrial products of the Electrical and Industrial Products
Segment decreased 19% to $18.3 million for fiscal 2000 as compared to $22.6
million in fiscal 1999. The decrease in revenues is from the continued
implementation of a diversification strategy to eliminate low margin products
and replace them with higher margin products. Fiscal 1999 revenues were higher
due to the liquidation of inventory as part of the implementation of the
Company's diversification strategy. Also as part of this strategy, a new product
for this group was introduced in the last quarter of fiscal 2000 to serve the
automotive industry.

The Company's Galvanizing Services Segment, which is made up of eleven hot dip
galvanizing facilities, generated revenues of $41.1 million, a 19% increase over
the prior year's revenues of $34.5 million. The increase was due to increased
volumes from increased customer demand for the Company's galvanizing services.
The acquisition of the Company's eleventh galvanizing facility on January 31,
2000 had little impact on fiscal 2000. The Galvanizing Services Segment also
benefited from the overall expansion of the domestic economy.

Operating Income

The Company's consolidated operating income (see note 12 to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements) increased $4.7 million or 39% for fiscal
2000. The improved operating results for fiscal 2000 were a direct result of
increased volumes and expanding margins in both segments of Company's
businesses.

In the Electrical and Industrial Products Segment, operating income for fiscal
2000 increased to $7 million up 60% from $4.4 million in fiscal 1999. Operating
margin in this segment improved for fiscal 2000 to 14%, a 45% increase from the
prior years operating margin of 9%.

Operating income for this segment's electrical products increased 89% to $5.3
million for fiscal 2000 as compared to $2.8 million in fiscal 1999. Margins
improved 36% to 16% for fiscal 2000 as compared to 12% in the prior year. The
acquisition on September 1, 1999 contributed $227,000 of operating income for
the six months of fiscal 2000. The existing electrical products from this group
produced improved operating margins of 18% due to a market shift from foreign
demand in fiscal 1999 to domestic demand in fiscal 2000. The domestic market
during fiscal 2000 was very dynamic due to deregulation of the power industry,
which resulted in favorable pricing in the domestic market versus the foreign
markets primarily served in fiscal 1999, which were very competitive due to the
turmoil in the Asian and Latin American markets. The products of this group also
recorded improved margins as a result of operational efficiencies associated
with a recent plant expansion at one of its facilities.

Operating income for this segment's industrial products increased 8% to $1.7
million for fiscal 2000 as compared to $1.6 million for fiscal 1999. Operating
margin for this product group improved 35% to 9% for fiscal 2000 as compared to
7% in fiscal 1999. The liquidation of inventories had a negative effect on
operating margins for fiscal 1999. In fiscal 2000, the Company continued a
diversification strategy, which eliminated low margin products in order to
concentrate on higher margin products and the introduction of a new product for
the automotive industry. The new product had very little impact on fiscal 2000.

In the Galvanizing Services Segment, operating income increased 27% to $9.5
million for fiscal 2000 from $7.5 million for the prior year. Operating margin
improved to 23.2% for fiscal 2000 from 21.6% in fiscal 1999. Operations
benefited from stable zinc costs, improved volumes, and a continued overall
expansion of the domestic economy. The acquisition of the Company's eleventh
galvanizing facility on January 31, 2000 had little impact on the operation for
fiscal 2000.

General Corporate Expense

General corporate expenses for fiscal 2000 were $4.3 million, up 38% from fiscal
1999. As a percent of sales, general corporate expenses were 4.6% for fiscal
2000 compared to 3.9% in the prior year. This increase was attributed to higher
employee benefits and profit sharing expenses as well as higher expenses for
professional services primarily associated with acquisitions.

Interest expense for fiscal 2000 was $1.7 million, up 70% or $692,000 from
fiscal 1999. This increase was due to larger outstanding loan balances during
fiscal 2000 associated with the acquisitions made during fiscal 2000 as well as
the repurchase of 1.2 million shares of the Company's common stock in the last
quarter of fiscal 1999.

Other income and expense consists of scrap sales and other (income) expense
items not specifically identifiable to a segment.

Provision For Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of 37.5% for both
fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company has historically met its liquidity and capital resource needs
through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and bank
borrowings. The Company's cash requirements are generally for operating
activities, acquisitions, capital improvements, debt repayment and dividend
payments. The Company believes that working

                                       10
<PAGE>

capital, borrowing capabilities, and the funds generated from operations should
be sufficient to finance anticipated operational requirements, internal growth,
and possible future acquisitions.

The Company's operating activities generated cash flows of approximately $12.4
million, $13.8 million, and $8.8 million during fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively. Cash flows provided by operations in fiscal 2001 included net
income in the amount of $8.2 million, depreciation and amortization in the
amount of $5.8 million, and net changes in operating assets and liabilities and
other decreased cash flows from operations by $1.6 million.

Through the use of cash flows and bank debt, the Company made $5.1 million in
capital improvements. The breakdown of capital spending by segment can be found
in Note 12 of Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements. Other major uses of
cash during fiscal 2001 included the repayment of long-term debt in the amount
of $8.2 million and payment of cash dividends in the amount of $771,000.

The Company has a credit facility with a bank that provides for a $20 million
revolving line of credit, a $10 million term note, and a $17.5 million term
note. At the end of fiscal 2001, the Company had $5.8 million outstanding under
the revolving line of credit and $21.4 million outstanding under the two term
facilities. At February 28, 2001, the Company has approximately $13.8 million
available under the revolving credit facility. The Company utilizes interest
rate swap agreements to protect against volatile interest rates. At the end of
fiscal 2001, the Company had in place interest rate swaps agreements covering
$15.7 million of term debt. The Company entered into the first interest rate
swap in February 1999 covering $10 million of term interest for the term of the
obligation. On April 2000, the Company entered into a second interest rate swap
covering $10 million of the $17.5 million term note for the period from April
2000 to April 2002. More information regarding interest rate swaps can be found
in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company's current ratio was 1.88 to 1 at the end of fiscal 2001, and
shareholders' equity grew 31% during fiscal 2001 to $43 million ($8.87 per
share). Long-term debt as a percent of shareholders' equity was 53% for the
current year compared to 94% in the prior year.

Inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company's operations in recent
years; however, the Company attempts to recover any cost increases through
improvements to its manufacturing processes and through increases in price where
competitively feasible.

Forward Looking Statements

This Report contains, and from time to time the Company or certain of its
representatives may make, "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are generally
identified by the use of words such as "anticipate," "expect," "estimate,"
"intend," "should," "may," "believe," and terms with similar meanings. Although
the Company believes that the current views and expectations reflected in these
forward-looking statements are reasonable, those views and expectations, and the
related statements, are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties, and other
factors, many of which are not under the Company's control. Those risks,
uncertainties, and other factors could cause the actual results to differ
materially from these in the forward-looking statements. Those risks,
uncertainties, and factors include, but are not limited to, many of the matters
described in this Report: change in demand, prices and raw material cost,
including zinc which is used in the hot dip galvanizing process; changes in the
economic conditions of the various markets the Company serves, foreign and
domestic, including the market price for oil and natural gas; acquisition
opportunities, adequacy of financing, and availability of experienced management

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk relating to the Company's operations results primarily from changes
in interest rates and commodity prices. The Company has only limited involvement
with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes
and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives.

The Company manages its exposures to changes in interest rates by optimizing the
use of variable and fixed rate debt. The Company had approximately $11.5 million
of variable rate borrowings at February 28, 2001. In February 1999 and April
2000 the Company entered into interest rate protection agreements with its
lender to modify the interest characteristics on a total of approximately $15.7
million of long-term debt from a variable rate to a fixed rate. The Company
believes it has adequately protected itself from increased cost under its
financial arrangements.

The Company manages its exposures to commodity prices, primarily zinc used in
its Galvanizing Services Segment, by utilizing contracts with its zinc suppliers
that include protective caps to guard against rising commodity prices.
Management believes these contractual agreements ensure adequate supplies and
guard against exposure to commodity price swings.

The Company does not believe that a hypothetical change of 10% of the interest
rate currently in effect or a change of 10% of commodity prices would have a
significantly adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows.

                  Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

1.   Summary of significant accounting policies

     Organization--AZZ incorporated (the "Company") operates primarily in the
     ------------
     United States. Information about the Company's operations by segment is
     included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

     Basis of consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include the
     ----------------------
     accounts of AZZ incorporated and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and
     partnerships. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have
     been eliminated in consolidation.

     Use of estimates--The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
     ----------------
     with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
     estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities
     and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
     financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
     during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
     estimates.

     Concentrations of credit risk--Financial instruments that potentially
     -----------------------------
     subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
     principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.

     The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various financial
     institutions. These financial institutions are located throughout the
     United States and Company policy is designed to limit exposure to any one
     institution. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative
     credit standing of those financial institutions that are considered in the
     Company's banking relationships. The Company has not experienced any losses
     in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit
     risk on cash and cash equivalents.

     Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are
     limited due to the Company's diversity by virtue of two operating segments,
     the number of customers, and the absence of a concentration of trade
     accounts receivable in a small number of customers. The Company's net
     credit losses in 2001, 2000, and 1999 were approximately $219,000,
     $168,000, and $127,000, respectively. Collateral is usually not required
     from customers as a condition of sale.

     Revenue recognition--The Company recognizes revenue for the Galvanizing
     -------------------
     Services segment upon shipment of product, FOB shipping point. Revenue for
     the Electrical and Industrial Products segment is recognized upon shipment
     of product, FOB shipping point, or based upon the percentage-of-completion
     method of accounting as contract services are performed. The extent of
     progress for revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion method
     is measured by the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to estimated
     total contract costs at completion. Costs and estimated earnings in excess
     of related billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as current assets
     and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted
     contracts are recorded as current liabilities.

     Contract costs include all direct material and labor, and certain indirect
     costs. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as
     incurred. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts
     are made in the period in which such losses are anticipated.

     Cash and cash equivalents--For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and
     -------------------------
     cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits with banks and all highly
     liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

     Inventories--Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
     -----------
     determined principally using a weighted-average method for the Electrical
     and Industrial Products segment and first-in-first-out (FIFO) method for
     the Galvanizing Services segment.

                  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.   Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

     Property, plant and equipment--For financial reporting purposes,
     -----------------------------
     depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated
     useful lives of the related assets as follows:

                    Buildings and structures          10-25 years
                    Machinery and equipment            3-15 years
                    Furniture and fixtures             3-15 years
                    Automotive equipment                  3 years

     Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; renewals and
     betterments are capitalized.

     Intangible assets and costs in excess of fair value of assets acquired
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     ("goodwill")--Intangible assets include purchased intangibles primarily
     ------------
     comprised of customer lists and non-compete agreements. Such intangible
     assets and goodwill are being amortized using the straight-line method over
     the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 5 to 40 years.

     Impairment of long-lived assets --The Company reviews long-lived assets and
     -------------------------------
     certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes
     in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset is impaired.
     Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of
     the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be
     generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
     impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
     amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Management
     assesses whether there has been an impairment of goodwill by considering
     factors such as expected future operating income, current operating results
     and other economic factors.

     Income Taxes--Income tax expense is based on the liability method. Under
     ------------
     this method of accounting, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
     recognized based on differences between financial statement and income tax
     bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates and laws.

     Stock-based compensation--The Company grants stock options for a fixed
     ------------------------
     number of shares to employees and directors with an exercise price equal to
     the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The Company has elected
     to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
     Issued to Employees" (APB 25), and related interpretations in accounting
     for employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the
     Company's employee and director stock options equal the market price of the
     underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
     recognized.

     Financial Instruments--The Company's financial instruments consist of cash
     ---------------------
     and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, and long-term debt. The fair
     value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various market
     data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. Unless otherwise
     disclosed, the fair value of financial instruments approximates their
     recorded values.

     Interest rates on the majority of the Company's borrowings float with
     prevailing market rates; therefore, the fair value of such debt
     approximates carrying value at February 28, 2001 and February 29, 2000. The
     Company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage variable interest rate risk
     associated with portions of its long-term debt. The fair value of interest
     rate swap agreements is based on quotes obtained from financial
     institutions. Information about the Company's swap agreements is included
     in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.

     Derivative Financial Instruments - From time to time, the Company uses
     --------------------------------
     derivatives to manage interest rate risk. The Company's policy is to use
     derivatives for risk management purposes only, which includes maintaining
     the ratio between the Company's fixed and floating rate debt obligations
     that management deems appropriate, and prohibits entering into such
     contracts for trading purposes. The Company enters into derivatives only
     with counterparties (primarily financial institutions) which have

     wherewithal to minimize credit risk. The amount of gains or losses from the
     use of derivative financial instruments has not been and is not expected to
     be material to the Company's financial statements.

     New Accounting Pronouncements
     -----------------------------

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
     "Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities," which was amended by
     SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
     Hedging Activities (an Amendment of FASB Statement 133)," (collectively
     "SFAS 133"). SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards of
     derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
     in other contracts, and for hedging activities. The Statement will require
     the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
     value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value
     through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of
     the hedge, changes in fair value of derivatives will either be offset
     against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm
     commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income
     until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of
     a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in
     earnings. The company will adopt SFAS 133 in its quarter ending May 31,
     2001. The Company has evaluated its derivative instruments, consisting
     solely of two interest rate protection agreements, and believes these
     instruments will qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to SFAS 133.

8.   Earnings per share

     Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares
     outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share were similarly
     computed but have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of the weighted-
     average number of stock options outstanding. Cash dividends paid per share
     were $.16, $.12 and $.10 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
     earnings per share:

8.   Earnings per share (continued)

     Stock options for which the exercise price was greater than the average
     market price of common shares were not included in the computation of
     diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. At the end
     of fiscal years 2001, 2000, and 1999, there were 0, 229,487, and 248,468
     stock options, respectively, outstanding with exercise prices greater than
     the average market price of common shares.

9.   Stock options and other shareholder matters

     The Company has two Incentive Stock Option Plans for its employees. The
     maximum number of shares that may be issued under each of the plans is
     750,000, and 525,000 shares respectively. At February 28, 2001, options
     outstanding under these plans amounted to 167,661 of which 161,661 options
     are vested and exercisable at prices (equal to the market price at the date
     of grant) ranging from $8.88 to $17.81 per share. Options under these plans
     vest from immediately upon issuance to ratably over a period of five years
     and expire at various dates through October 2005. Included in these
     outstanding options are 2,194 options granted in fiscal 2001 with an
     exercise price ranging from $10.25 to $17.81, which vest immediately.

     The Company also has three Non-statutory Stock Option Plans for the
     independent directors of the Company. The maximum number of shares that may
     be issued under each of the plans is 250,000, 115,762 and 157,500 shares.
     At February 28, 2001, options granted and outstanding under these plans
     amounted to 86,500 of which 68,300 options are vested and exercisable at
     prices ranging from $3.69 to $16.88 per share. Options under these plans
     vest ratably over a five-year period and expire at various dates through
     July 2008.

     In February 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with a company to
     issue 70,000 stock options in exchange for services received and to be
     received. A majority of these options vest over a period of eighteen months
     contingent upon the achievement of certain performance measures. As of
     February 28, 2001, 38,500 options have vested under this plan and the
     remaining 31,500 unvested options, vest in three separate groups over six
     months following February 28, 2001 contingent upon the company meeting
     certain performance goals. During fiscal 2001 the Company recorded expense
     of $159,000 related to these options. These options expire in February
     2005.

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for
     Stock Based Compensation," requires the disclosure of pro forma net income
     and income per share of common stock computed as if the Company had
     accounted for its stock options granted subsequent to February 28, 1995
     under the fair value method set forth in SFAS 123. The fair value of stock
     options granted was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
     option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: a
     risk-free interest rate ranging from 5.8% to 6.5%, a dividend yield ranging
     from 1% to 1.25% and a volatility factor ranging from .419 to .498. In
     addition, the fair value of these options was estimated based on an
     expected life ranging from 1 1/2 years to 5 years.

     The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
     estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting
     restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation
     models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
     expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's stock options have
     characteristics significantly different from those described above, and
     because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
     the fair value estimate, in management's opinion the existing models do not
     necessarily provide a reliable single measure of fair value for the
     Company's stock options.

     For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
     options is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the option's
     vesting period as adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The Company's pro
     forma income and income per share for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999 using the
     fair value method is as follows:

                                             2001         2000        1999

     As of February 28, 2001, the Company has approximately 1,868,262 and
     16,827,158 shares, respectively, reserved for future issuance under the
     stock option plans and shareholder rights plan.

     Effective January 7, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a stock rights
     plan, which authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one right
     for each share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on
     February 4, 1999. The rights are exercisable at an initial exercise price
     of $60, subject to certain adjustments as defined in the agreement, if a
     person or group acquires 15% or more of the Company's common stock or
     announces a tender offer that would result in ownership of 15% or more of
     the common stock. Alternatively, the rights may be redeemed at one cent per
     right at any time before a 15% position has been acquired. The rights
     expire on January 7, 2009.

     The Company's credit facility and industrial revenue bonds are subject to
     loan agreements which require the Company to comply with various financial
     covenants including minimum requirements with regard to tangible net worth,
     funded debt to EBITDA, dividend payments, capital expenditures and cash
     flows. The Company is in compliance with these covenants as of February 28,
     2001. The Company's long-term debt is secured by receivables, inventory,
     equipment, and fixtures. Under the terms of the credit facility,
     borrowing's on the revolving line of credit are subject to a borrowing base
     calculation which is limited to 80% of certain trade accounts receivable
     and a range of 50% to 60% of certain raw materials and finished good
     inventories and is reduced by the balance of outstanding letters of credit
     which may not exceed $2 million at any one time. At February 28, 2001, the
     Company has approximately $13,790,000 available under the revolving credit
     facility after deducting $460,000 of outstanding letters of credit.

     In order to reduce interest rate risk, the Company in February 1999 and
     April 2000 entered into interest rate protection agreements through the
     bank (the Swap Agreements) to modify the interest characteristics of the
     $10 million Term Note B and $10 million of the Term Note A, respectively,
     from a variable rate to a fixed rate. Term Note A Swap Agreement involves
     the exchange of interest obligations from April 2000 through April 2002
     whereby the Company receives a fixed rate of 8.51% in exchange for a
     variable 30-day LIBOR plus 1.25% (6.88% at February 28,2001), which is the
     stated interest rate under the Term Note A agreement. Term Note B Swap
     Agreement involves the exchange of interest obligations over the life of
     the Term Note B whereby the Company receives a fixed rate of 6.8% in
     exchange for a variable 30-day LIBOR plus 1.25% (6.88% at February 28,
     2001), which is the stated interest rate under the Term Note B agreement.
     Management intends to hold the Term A and Term B Swap Agreements until
     their maturities of April 2002 and March 2006, respectively. The Company
     has incurred no additional interest expense related to these Swap
     Agreements for the year ended February 28, 2001. The fair value of the Term
     A and Term B Swap Agreements represent a loss of approximately $(223,000)
     and $(73,000), respectively, at February 28, 2001.

12.  Operating segments

     The Company has two reportable segments as defined by the Financial
     Accounting Standards Board No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an
     Enterprise and Related Information": (1) Electrical and Industrial Products
     and (2) Galvanizing Services. The Electrical and Industrial Products
     segment provides highly engineered specialty components supplied to the
     power generation transmission, and distribution market as well as products
     to the industrial market. The Galvanizing Services segment provides hot dip
     galvanizing services to the steel fabrication industry through facilities
     located throughout the south and southwest. Hot dip galvanizing is a
     metallurgical process by which molten zinc is applied to a customer's
     material. The zinc bonding renders a corrosive resistant coating enhancing
     the life of the material for up to fifty years.

     Statement No. 131 modified existing standards for reporting information
     about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires
     selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports
     issued to stockholders. Operating segments are defined as components of an
     enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
     evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision
     making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
     performance. The segments follow the same accounting policies as described
     in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1). Information
     regarding operations and assets by segment is as follows:

        Leases

        The Company leases various facilities under non-cancelable operating
        leases with an initial term in excess of one year. As of February 28,
        2001, the future minimum payments required under these operating leases
        are summarized as follows:

                  Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

13.    Commitments and contingencies (continued) - Leases

       Rental expense for real estate and personal property was approximately
       $1,003,000, $800,000, and $369,000 for the years ended February 28, 2001,
       February 29, 2000 and February 28, 1999, respectively, and includes all
       short-term as well as long-term rental agreements.

       Litigation and Environmental Contingencies

       The Company is subject to various environmental protection reviews by
       state and federal government agencies and has been identified as a
       potential responsible party in certain investigations conducted by these
       agencies. The Company did not expense any significant amounts related to
       environmental liabilities in 2001, 2000, or 1999. The ultimate liability,
       if any, which might result from such reviews or additional clean-up and
       remediation expenses cannot presently be determined; however, as a result
       of an internal analysis and prior clean-up efforts, management believes
       the results will not have a material impact on the Company and that the
       recorded reserves for estimated losses are adequate.

       In order to maintain permits to operate certain of the Company's
       facilities, future capital expenditures for equipment may be required to
       meet new or existing environmental regulations.

       The Company is involved from time to time in various suits and claims
       arising in the normal course of business. In management's opinion, the
       ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on
       the Company's financial position or results of operations.

14.    Acquisitions

       In September 1999 and February 2000, the Company purchased CGIT and
       Westside Galvanizing, respectively. The total purchase price, net of cash
       acquired, for these two businesses was approximately $13 million and
       $10.6 million, respectively, and comprised of cash paid of $10.9 million
       and $9.9 million and liabilities assumed of $2.1 million and $752,000,
       respectively. The assets purchased were recorded at estimated fair value
       and the costs in excess of fair value for these acquisitions of
       approximately $7.3 million and $5.7 million were recorded as goodwill.
       Pursuant to the provisions of the purchase agreement for CGIT, the
       Company is to receive from the seller purchase price refunds
       approximating $371,000 as of February 28, 2001.

       These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
       accounting. The excess of costs over fair value for these two
       acquisitions is being amortized over a period of 15 and 20 years,
       respectively. Operations applicable to acquired businesses are included
       in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income from their
       respective dates of acquisitions. The pro forma consolidated results of
       operations for the year ended February 29, 2000 assuming the acquisitions
       had been consummated as of March 1, 1999 are as follows:
