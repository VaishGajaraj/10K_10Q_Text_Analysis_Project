Corporation is relocating certain back office operations to Puerto Rico and New York. The Corporation recorded a net gain of $33.8 million, after customary transaction costs, as a result of these
transactions. After the reorganization is complete, annual operating expenses are expected to decrease by approximately $35 million. This decrease in expenses is expected to offset a similar reduction in revenues that will result from the sale of
the regional operations. The Corporation recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $186.5 million, related to the goodwill asset allocated to these regions. This non-cash charge had no impact on the Corporation&#146;s tangible capital or
regulatory capital ratios. The Corporation also executed other transactions as part of the reorganization of its U.S. operations. These included the refinancing of $638 million in structured repos, which resulted in increased margins, at a cost of
approximately $39.8 million recognized during 2014. Also, the Corporation completed bulk sales or agreements to sell of non-performing and legacy assets with an aggregate book value of approximately $249 million, at a net loss of $11.1 million. </P>

changed the income tax rate for capital gains from 15% to 20%. As a result, the Corporation recognized an income tax expense of approximately $20.0 million during 2014, mainly related to the deferred tax liability associated with the portfolio
acquired from Westernbank. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">During the second quarter of 2014, the Corporation entered into a Closing Agreement with the Puerto Rico
Department of Treasury. The Agreement, among other matters, was related to the income tax treatment of certain charge-offs related to the loans acquired from Westernbank as part of the FDIC assisted transaction in the year 2010. As a result of the

developers and the financing of owner-occupied facilities if there is real estate as collateral. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability
that exceeds debt service requirements. Non-owner-occupied CRE loans are generally made to finance office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the

the loss sharing agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the loss sharing agreements, the FDIC&#146;s obligation to reimburse BPPR for losses with respect to assets covered by such agreements (the &#147;covered assets&#148;) begins with the first
dollar of loss incurred. On a combined basis, the FDIC will reimburse BPPR for 80% of all qualifying losses with respect to the covered assets during the covered period. BPPR will reimburse the FDIC for 80% of qualifying recoveries with respect to
losses for which the FDIC reimbursed BPPR. The loss sharing agreement applicable to single-family residential mortgage loans provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for ten years (ending on April&nbsp;30, 2020), and the
loss sharing agreement applicable to commercial and other assets provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for five years (ending on April&nbsp;30, 2015), with additional recovery sharing for three years thereafter. </P>

developers and the financing of owner-occupied facilities if there is real estate as collateral. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability
that exceeds debt service requirements. Non owner-occupied CRE loans are generally made to finance office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the

We currently do not make &#147;no doc&#148; or &#147;stated income&#148; loans where there is no income or asset verification by the lender. The credit policies also set forth the required closing documentation depending on the loan and the

are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrower&#146;s operations, including the borrower&#146;s business model, management, financial statements, pro-forma financial condition including financial projections, use of funds, debt
service capacity, leverage and the financial strength of any guarantor. Most of our commercial and construction loans are secured by real estate and other collateral. A review of the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party
appraisals of machinery and equipment and commercial real estate, as appropriate, is also conducted. Physical inspection of the collateral and audits of receivables is conducted when appropriate. Our credit policies provide maximum loan-to-value
ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value percentage varies by the type of collateral. Our loan-to value limitations are, in certain cases, determined
by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor, the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself. Most CRE loans are originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and
owners. Non-recourse lending is limited to borrowers with very solid financial capacity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; text-indent:5%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">As of December&nbsp;31,

consistent with the underwriting approach described above, but also include an assessment of each borrower&#146;s personal financial condition, including verification of income, assets and FICO score. Credit reports are obtained and reconciled with
the financial statements provided to us. Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans does not exist, for risk assessment purposes, subprime consumer and mortgage loans in the BPPR segment are determined based on the final rule
definition of higher risk consumer loans issued by the FDIC which was made effective during 2014. A higher-risk consumer loan is defined as a loan where, as of origination, or as of refinance, the probability of default (PD) within two years is
greater than 20%. In Puerto Rico, as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, consumer and mortgage loans with subprime characteristics consisted of $248.1 million (7% of the Puerto Rico consumer loan portfolio) and $803.4 million (15% of the Puerto Rico mortgage
loan portfolio), respectively. Since the final rule definition is not applicable to our US operation, subprime loans in the BPNA segment are defined as borrowers with one or a combination of certain credit risk factors, such as FICO scores
(generally less than 620 for secured products and 660 for unsecured products), high debt to income ratios (higher than 50%) and inferior payment history, including factors such as defaults and limited credit history. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014,
our mainland United States consumer and mortgage loans with subprime characteristics consisted of $48.5 million (or 10% of the U.S. mainland consumer loan portfolio) and $375.1 million (or 36% of U.S. mainland mortgage loans portfolio). As part of
the restructuring in 2008 of our U.S. mainland operations, we discontinued originating loans with subprime characteristics in those operations, including the U.S. non-conventional mortgage loan portfolio and E-LOAN. Popular does not target subprime
borrowers and does not offer products specifically designed for subprime borrowers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">As of

mortgage loans in our Puerto Rico portfolio. In Puerto Rico, we offer a special step loan mortgage product to purchasers of units within construction projects financed by BPPR. This product, with a term of up to 40 years, provides for 100% financing
at a 2.99% interest rate for the first five years of the term of the loan and 5.88% fixed-rate for the remaining term. Consistent with our credit policies, the underwriting and loan approval process for our step loan mortgage product is based on a
number of factors, including an assessment of each borrower&#146;s personal financial condition (including verification of income, assets and FICO score), as well as debt-to-equity ratio, reserves, loan-to-value and prior mortgage experience. While
Popular has not established specific limits for FICO scores, debt-to-income ratios and loan-to-values applicable to this product, the underwriting parameters applied to this product are generally similar to the standards used for the underwriting of
our non-conforming loans, except for higher loan-to-value ratios (90% or higher). As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, Popular had $414.2 million of these step loans. </P>

facilities are structured as lines of credit, which are mainly one year in term and therefore are required to be renewed annually. Other facilities may be restructured or extended from time to time based upon changes in the borrower&#146;s business
needs, use of funds, timing of completion of projects and other factors. If the borrower is not deemed to have financial difficulties, extensions, renewals and restructurings are done in the normal course of business and not considered concessions,

payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification; (ii)&nbsp;the borrower has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy; (iii)&nbsp;there is significant doubt as to whether the borrower will continue
to be a going concern; (iv)&nbsp;currently, the borrower has securities that have been delisted, are in the process of being delisted, or are under threat of being delisted from an exchange; and (v)&nbsp;based on estimates and projections that only
encompass the current business capabilities, the borrower forecasts that its entity-specific cash flows will be insufficient to service the debt (both interest and principal) in accordance with the contractual terms of the existing agreement through
maturity; and absent the current modification, the borrower cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at an effective interest rate equal to the current market interest rate for similar debt for a non-troubled debtor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We have specialized workout officers who handle substantially all commercial loans that are past due 90 days and over,
borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, and those that are considered problem loans based on their risk profile. As a general policy, we do not advance additional money to borrowers that are 90 days past due or over. In commercial and
construction loans, certain exceptions may be approved under certain circumstances, including (i)&nbsp;when past due status is administrative in nature, such as expiration of a loan facility before the new documentation is executed, and not as a

industry or other criteria, such as a percentage of the banks&#146; capital. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Loans to borrowers
with financial difficulties can be modified as a loss mitigation alternative. New terms and conditions of these loans are individually evaluated to determine a feasible loan restructuring. In many consumer and mortgage loans, a trial period is
established where the borrower has to comply with three consecutive monthly payments under the new terms before implementing the new structure. Loans that are restructured, renewed or extended due to financial difficulties and the terms reflect
concessions that would not otherwise be granted are considered as Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#147;TDRs&#148;). These concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal,
forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. These concessions stem from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or are imposed by law or a court. TDRs also include loans for which the Corporation has entered into
liquidation proceedings with borrowers in which neither principal or interest is forgiven, but the Corporation accepts payments which are different than the contractual payment schedule. Refer to additional information on TDRs on Note 12 to the
consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. </P>

if the loan was in non-accruing status at the time of the modification. The TDR loan will continue in non-accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated a willingness and ability to make the restructured loan payments (at least six months of
sustained performance after classified as TDR and management has concluded whether it is probable that the borrower would not be in payment default in a foreseeable future). If the loan was appropriately on accrual status prior to the restructuring,
the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms (for a period of at least six months, as defined), and the bank&#146;s credit evaluation shows the borrower&#146;s capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms (both
principal and interest payments), it is likely that the appropriate conclusion is for the loan to remain on accrual at the time of the restructuring. Loans classified as TDRs are excluded from TDR status if performance under the restructured terms
exists for a reasonable period (at least twelve months of sustained performance after being classified) and the loan yields a market rate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B>Business Concentration

municipalities amounted to $ 1.0 billion, of which approximately $ 811&nbsp;million is outstanding ($1.2 billion and $950 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). Of the amount outstanding, $ 689&nbsp;million consists of loans and $ 122&nbsp;million are
securities ($789 million and $161 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). Of this amount, $ 336&nbsp;million represents obligations from the Government of Puerto Rico and public corporations that are either collateralized loans or obligations that have
a specific source of income or revenues identified for their repayment ($527 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans to public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for
services or products, such as public utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from the central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from it. The remaining $ 475&nbsp;million represents obligations
from various municipalities in Puerto Rico for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment ($423 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). These municipalities
are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all of its general obligation bonds and loans. These loans have seniority to the payment of operating cost and expenses of the municipality.

exposure to loans or securities that are payable by non-governmental entities, but which carry a government guarantee to cover any shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default ($360 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). These included $289
million in residential mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (December 31, 2013 - $274 million). These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in
collateral in the event of a borrower default. Also, the Corporation had $49 million in Puerto Rico pass-through housing bonds backed by FNMA, GNMA or residential loans CMO&#146;s, and $32 million of industrial development notes ($52 million and $34

<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We have taken significant steps during the past years to counter the effect of the broad economic
slowdown in the United States and the prolonged economic recession in Puerto Rico, our principal market, where the economy entered into recession in the second quarter of 2006. In 2008, we participated in the TARP Capital Purchase Program in order
to strengthen our capital and liquidity position. In December 2008, we received $935 million from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#147;U.S. Treasury&#148;) as part of the TARP Capital Purchase Program in exchange for senior Perpetual Preferred
Stock and a warrant to purchase 2,093,283 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $67 per share (adjusted to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse stock split effective on May&nbsp;29, 2012). The shares of Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1
regulatory capital and paid cumulative dividends quarterly at a rate of 5%&nbsp;per annum for the first five years, and 9%&nbsp;per annum thereafter. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The TARP Capital Purchase Program gave us the opportunity to raise capital quickly and improve our
liquidity position, at a low cost, with limited shareholder dilution, at a time when the unprecedented market instability made it difficult, if not impossible, for us to raise capital. We used proceeds from the TARP, together with other available
moneys, to make capital contributions and loans to our banking subsidiaries to ensure they remain well-capitalized, and strengthen their ability to continue creditworthy lending in our home markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In August 2009, we completed an exchange offer in order to increase our common equity capital to
accommodate the more adverse economic and credit scenarios assumed under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (the &#147;SCAP&#148;), as applied to regional banking institutions. With the exchange offer we issued 35.7&nbsp;million new shares
of Common Stock in exchange for previously issued trust preferred securities and shares of preferred stock, and increased our Tier 1 common equity by $1.4 billion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In connection with the public exchange offer, we agreed with the U.S. Treasury to exchange the $935 million senior
perpetual preferred stock issued to it pursuant to the TARP Capital Purchase Program for $935 million of newly issued perpetual trust preferred securities, with the same distribution rate as that of the Preferred Stock. This exchange was completed
in August 2009. The trust preferred securities had a distribution rate of 5% until December&nbsp;5, 2013 and 9% thereafter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In
addition to our participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program and the completion of the exchange offer, during 2008 and 2009, we carried out various restructurings plans for our operations in the U.S. mainland to improve our U.S. operations,
address credit quality, contain controllable costs, maintain well capitalized ratios and improve capital and liquidity positions. Most of these plans were successfully completed at the end of 2009. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; text-indent:5%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">During 2010, the Corporation enhanced its capital position with an equity offering in which it raised $1.15 billion of
new common equity capital. This capital raise, along with the after-tax gain of $531.0 million, net of transaction costs, on the sale of a 51% interest in EVERTEC, substantially strengthened the Corporation&#146;s capital ratios, placing it in a
position to participate in the consolidation of the Puerto Rico banking market and to pursue strategies to improve the credit quality of its loan portfolio. On April&nbsp;30, 2010, BPPR acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of
Westernbank from the FDIC in an assisted transaction. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We have also carried out a series of actions to improve our
Puerto Rico operations, credit quality and profitability. During 2009, we implemented cost-cutting measures such as the reduction in hiring and pension plan freezes and the suspension of matching contributions to retirement plans. During 2011,
further steps were taken to improve our profitability, including the implementation of a voluntary employee retirement window at the end of 2011. As a result of this initiative in December 2011, we recorded $15.6 million in pension costs related to
369 employees that were eligible and elected to participate in the retirement program. The retirement was effective on January&nbsp;31, 2012. Also, during 2011 the Corporation executed sales of $457 million (unpaid principal balance) non-performing
mortgage loans at BPNA and $358 million in unpaid principal balance of construction and commercial real estate loans at BPPR as part of its de-risking strategy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We have continued to look for synergies and efficiencies within our operations. On December 2012,
Popular Mortgage, Inc. was merged into Banco Popular. This consolidation, among other things, resulted in cost savings for the Corporation. For the year 2013, FDIC deposit insurance expense was $25.2 million lower than for 2012, including a credit
of $11.3 million received during the first quarter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">During 2013, the Corporation continued to look
for opportunities to strengthen its capital structure and de-risk its balance sheet. The Corporation monetized part of its investment in EVERTEC by participating as a selling stockholder in EVERTEC&#146;s public offerings. The Corporation recorded
an after tax gain of $413 million as a result of these transactions, as discussed above.&nbsp;BPPR completed sales of assets with a book value of $944 million, most of which were in non-performing status. Coupled with loss mitigation strategies and
aggressive resolution of non-performing loans, the Corporation was able to reduce its non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, by $1.1 billion from December&nbsp;31, 2012. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">For the year 2014, the FDIC deposit insurance expense was $16.4 million lower than for 2013. This
reduction was also attributed to a lower volume of higher risk assets, after completion of the non-performing assets sales during the year 2013 and other efforts implemented by management. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; text-indent:6%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">On July&nbsp;2, 2014, the Corporation completed the repayment of TARP funds to the U.S. Treasury through the repurchase
of $935 million of trust capital securities issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program. The Corporation funded the repurchase through a combination of available cash and approximately $400 million from the proceeds of the
issuance of its $450 million aggregate principal amount of 7% Senior Notes due on 2019, which settled on July&nbsp;1, 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">On July&nbsp;23, 2014, the Corporation also completed the repurchase of the outstanding warrant
initially issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program in 2008 for a repurchase price of $3.0 million. With the completion of this transaction, the Corporation completed its exit from the TARP Capital Purchase Program. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Corporation completed the sale of its California,
Illinois and Central Florida regional operations to three different buyers as part of an internal reorganization. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation is relocating certain back office operations to Puerto Rico and New York. The
Corporation recorded a net gain of $33.8 million, after customary transaction costs, as a result of these transactions. After the reorganization is complete, annual operating expenses are expected to decrease by approximately $35 million. This
decrease in expenses is expected to offset a similar reduction in revenues that will result from the sale of the regional operations. The Corporation also executed other transactions as part of the reorganization of its U.S. operations. The
Corporation refinanced $638 million in structured repos, which resulted in increased margins, at a cost of approximately $39.8 million recognized during 2014. Also, the Corporation completed bulk sales or agreements to sell of non-performing and
legacy assets with an aggregate book value of approximately $249 million, at a net loss of $11.1 million. The Corporation recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $186.5 million, related to the goodwill asset allocated to these regions.
This non-cash charge had no impact on the Corporation&#146;s tangible capital or regulatory capital ratios. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B>Competition </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The financial services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. In Puerto Rico, our primary market, the

approximately $10 billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2014. On April&nbsp;30, 2010, the FDIC closed three commercial banks and entered into loss-share purchase and assumption agreements with three
other commercial banks with operations in Puerto Rico, including us with respect to Westernbank Puerto Rico. Those transactions involved the acquisition of most of the assets and liabilities of the closed banks, including the assumption of all of
the non-brokered deposits. While these transactions have reduced the number of banking competitors in Puerto Rico, they have allowed some of our competitors to gain greater resources, such as a broader range of products and services. On
December&nbsp;18, 2012, there was another banking consolidation in Puerto Rico when Oriental Financial Group, a locally based financial institution, acquired the Puerto Rico operations of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A. (BBVA), a foreign bank.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, there were 9 commercial banks operating in Puerto Rico. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We also
compete with specialized players in the local financial industry that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those competitors include brokerage houses, mortgage companies, insurance
companies, credit unions (locally known as &#147;cooperativas&#148;), credit card companies, consumer finance companies, institutional lenders and other financial and non-financial institutions and entities. Credit unions generally provide basic
consumer financial services. These competitors collectively represent a significant portion of the market and have lower cost structure and fewer regulatory constraints. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In the United States, our competition is primarily from community banks operating in our footprint and

<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In both Puerto Rico and the United States, the primary factors in competing for business include
pricing, convenience of branch locations and other delivery methods, range of products offered, and the level of service delivered. We must compete effectively along all these parameters to be successful. We may experience pricing pressure as some
of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. Competition is particularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is very aggressive. Increased competition could require that we increase the rates offered on deposits
or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:1%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Economic
factors, along with legislative and technological changes, will have an ongoing impact on the competitive environment within the financial services industry. We work to anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions whether it may be
developing and marketing innovative products and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our products and services, cross-marketing, or providing personalized banking services. We strive to distinguish ourselves from
other community banks and financial services providers in our marketplace by providing a high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to attract and retain business. However, we can provide no assurance as to the effectiveness of these
efforts on our future business or results of operations, as to our continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, and as to sufficiently improving our services and/or banking products in order to successfully compete in our

additional shares in connection with EVERTEC&#146;s public offerings. Revenue from the remaining 14.96% ownership interest in EVERTEC is reported as non-interest income in the Corporate group. </P>

implement financial regulatory requirements being proposed for the first time (for example, an enterprise-wide limit on exposures to any one counterparty and certain of its affiliates established at 25% of the capital and surplus of the covered
company) and others that overlap with other regulatory reforms (for example, the Basel III capital and liquidity reforms discussed below in this section). The Proposed SIFI Rules also address the Dodd-Frank Act&#146;s early remediation requirements
applicable to bank holding companies that have total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The proposed remediation rules are modeled after the prompt corrective action regime, described below, but are designed to require action beginning in
the earlier stages of a company&#146;s financial distress by mandating action on the basis of arranged triggers, including capital and leverage, stress test results, liquidity and risk management. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In October 2012, the Federal Reserve Board issued final rules implementing the requirements of Section&nbsp;165(i)(1) of the Dodd-Frank
Act concerning supervisory stress tests to be conducted by the Federal Reserve Board (the &#147;Annual Supervisory Stress Test Rule&#148;) and Section&nbsp;165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding semi-annual company-run stress tests (the
&#147;Semi-Annual Company-Run Stress Test Rule,&#148; and, together with the Annual Supervisory Stress Test Rule, the &#147;Stress Test Rules&#148;). The Stress Test Rules, effective on November&nbsp;15, 2012, apply to bank holding companies with
average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Concurrent with the Stress Test Rules, the Federal Reserve Board issued final rules implementing other
requirements of Section&nbsp;165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding annual company-run stress tests (the &#147;Annual Company-Run Stress Test Rules&#148;). The Annual Company-Run Stress Test Rules, effective on November&nbsp;15, 2012, apply to,
bank holding companies with average total consolidated assets of greater than $10 billion but less than $50 billion and any state member bank that has average total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion. The Stress Test Rules and the Annual
Company-Run Stress Test Rules set forth, among other things, the requirements on the methodology and scenarios for the stress tests and related publication requirements. On November&nbsp;7, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final policy
statement describing the processes it will use to develop scenarios for future capital planning and stress testing exercises. This policy statement became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2014. On October&nbsp;23, 2014, the Federal Reserve Board
released the supervisory scenarios that will be used in the next round of stress tests. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">On February&nbsp;18, 2014, the Federal
Reserve Board issued final rules (&#147;Final SIFI Rules&#148;) strengthening supervision and regulation of large U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations. The Final SIFI Rules established a number of enhanced prudential
standards for large U.S. bank holding companies to help increase the resiliency of their operations. These standards include liquidity, risk management, and capital. For U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or
more, the Final SIFI Rules incorporate the previously issued capital planning and stress testing requirements as an enhanced prudential standard. The Final SIFI Rules also require such a U.S. bank holding company to comply with enhanced
risk-management and liquidity risk-management standards, conduct liquidity stress tests, and hold a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs during a 30-day stress event. In addition, the Final SIFI Rules require publicly
traded U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more to establish enterprise-wide risk committees. </P>

Dodd-Frank Act stress test practices and offers additional details about methodologies that should be employed by banking organizations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion. </P>

&#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;, and &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148;. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk- based capital ratio </P>

and the leverage ratio. A depository institution&#146;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as
established by regulation. The relevant capital measures, which reflect changes under the Basel III Capital Rules that became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2015, are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio (a new ratio requirement under the
Basel III Capital Rules), the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:22pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">An insured depository institution will be deemed to be
(i)&nbsp;&#147;well capitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater (6.0% prior to January&nbsp;1, 2015),
and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii)&nbsp;&#147;adequately capitalized&#148; if the
institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater (4.0% prior to January&nbsp;1, 2015), and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is
not &#147;well capitalized&#148;; (iii)&nbsp;&#147;undercapitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% (4.0%
prior to January&nbsp;1, 2015) or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv)&nbsp;&#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3%, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% (3.0% prior to January&nbsp;1, 2015) or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v)&nbsp;&#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; if the institution&#146;s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of
average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an
unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. An insured depository institution&#146;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not
constitute an accurate representation of the institution&#146;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The
FDIC generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be
&#147;undercapitalized&#148;. &#147;Undercapitalized&#148; depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and
are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at the time it becomes
undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic
assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">&#147;Significantly undercapitalized&#148; depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including
orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. &#147;Critically undercapitalized&#148; depository institutions
are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to
the FDIC-insured depository institutions such as BPPR and BPNA, but they are not directly applicable to holding companies such as Popular and PNA, which control such institutions. As noted above, the Proposed SIFI Rules address the Dodd-Frank

provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all
dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income (as reportable in its Report of Condition and Income) for that year, combined with its retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the
preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its
Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the
Federal Reserve Board. Subject to the Federal Reserve&#146;s ability to establish more stringent specific requirements under its supervisory or enforcement authority, at December&nbsp;31, 2014, BPPR could have declared a dividend of approximately
$542 million. On October&nbsp;20, 2014, the Memorandum of Understanding (the &#147;FRB-NY MOU&#148;) entered into on July&nbsp;20, 2011 among Popular, Inc., BPPR, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the &#147;FRB-NY&#148;) and the Office of the
Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico was terminated. The FRB-NY MOU provided, among other things, for the Corporation to take steps to improve its credit risk management practices and asset quality, and for the Corporation to
develop strategic plans to improve earnings and to develop capital plans. The FRB-NY MOU also required the Corporation to obtain approval from the applicable FRB-NY MOU counterparties prior to, among other things, declaring or paying dividends,
purchasing or redeeming any shares of its stock, consummating acquisitions or mergers, or making any distributions on its trust preferred securities or subordinated debentures. On January&nbsp;9, 2015, another Memorandum of Understanding entered

Act&#148;) created a single DIF, increased the maximum amount of FDIC insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts, and provided for possible &#147;inflation adjustments&#148; in the maximum amount of coverage available with respect to other
insured accounts. Under the Reform Act, the FDIC made significant changes to its risk-based assessment system so that effective January&nbsp;1, 2007, the FDIC imposed insurance premiums based upon a matrix that is designed to more closely tie what
banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (&#147;EESA&#148;)
temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. Section&nbsp;335 of the Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 standard maximum limit for federal deposit insurance. In addition,
from December&nbsp;31, 2010 until January&nbsp;1, 2013, Section&nbsp;335 provided temporary unlimited federal deposit insurance protection for non-interest bearing transaction accounts that are payable on demand at insured depository institutions.

assessment base required by the Dodd-Frank Act, which is based on average total assets less average tangible equity. Section&nbsp;334 required the FDIC to take the steps necessary for the DIF to meet this revised reserve ratio by September&nbsp;30,

in initial assessment rates previously scheduled to take place on January&nbsp;1, 2011. On December&nbsp;14, 2010, the FDIC adopted a final rule, which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2011, to set the DIF&#146;s designated reserve ratio at 2% of
estimated insured deposits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">As required by Sections 331 and 332 of the Dodd-Frank Act, on February&nbsp;7, 2011, the FDIC adopted a
final rule relating to deposit insurance assessment base, assessment rate adjustments, deposit insurance assessment rates, dividends, and large bank pricing methodology, which became effective on April&nbsp;1, 2011. Under the final rule, the
assessment base for an insured depository institution is the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution minus the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period. Prior to April&nbsp;1, 2011, only

regulatory capital ratios and replace the prior general risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel Committee&#146;s 1988 &#147;Basel I&#148; capital accords, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the
&#147;standardized approach&#148; in the Basel Committee&#146;s 2004 &#147;Basel II&#148; capital accords. In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules implement certain provisions of Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section&nbsp;939A to

This election must be made concurrently with the first filing of certain of Popular&#146;s, BPPR&#146;s and BPNA&#146;s periodic regulatory reports in the beginning of 2015. Popular, BPPR and BPNA expect to make this election in order to avoid

that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Basel III Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category. Failure to

of a transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the costs of fraud prevention. On June&nbsp;29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network
exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. The final rule regarding debit card interchange fees became effective on October&nbsp;1, 2011. Under the final rule, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an

establish one or more bank branches in a state of the United States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from

Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real
estate market. Recent economic reports related to the real estate market in Puerto Rico indicate that several sectors of the real estate market are subject to reductions in value related to general economic conditions. In certain mainland markets
like southern Florida, Illinois and California, we have experienced the negative impact associated with low absorption rates and property value adjustments due to overbuilding. We exited the Illinois and California operations in 2014. We measure
loan impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, which is derived from estimated collateral values, principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration prices in observed
transactions involving similar assets in similar locations, size and supply and demand. An appraisal report is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be
obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, given the current slowdown in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, the properties securing these
loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Construction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential
real estate properties, entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to

began placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. Government intervened on an unprecedented scale. Several funding and capital programs by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury were launched in 2008
and 2009, with the objective of enhancing financial institutions&#146; ability to raise liquidity. These programs had the effect of increasing the degree or nature of regulatory supervision to which we are subjected. These and other potential
regulation and scrutiny may, or proposed legislative and regulatory changes could, significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and, limit our ability to

deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expands the FDIC&#146;s authority to raise insurance premiums. The legislation also calls for the FDIC to raise the ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by
September&nbsp;30, 2020 and to &#147;offset the effect&#148; of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions,
establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve, which will have broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit
products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards, and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower&#146;s ability to repay and prepayment penalties. The Dodd-Frank
Act also includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts. The legislation also restricts proprietary

institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at
prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings. </P>

institution&#146;s required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by the Corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately $92 million at December&nbsp;31, 2014. The Corporation could be required to post additional
collateral under the agreements. Management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the

have on economic activity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">On February&nbsp;12, 2015, S&amp;P further downgraded the debt rating of the Commonwealth general
obligation bonds and of various public instrumentalities. S&amp;P stated that, in their view, Puerto Rico&#146;s current economic and financial trajectory is now more susceptible to adverse financial, economic and market conditions that could
ultimately impair the Commonwealth&#146;s ability to fund services and its debt commitments. S&amp;P also cited implementation risk with respect to the value-added tax and expressed concern that, while higher taxes could improve the budget balance,
there could be potential negative economic implications. On February&nbsp;19, 2015, Moody&#146;s also downgraded its debt ratings for the Commonwealth general obligation bonds and of various public instrumentalities, citing similar concerns as
S&amp;P. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential further ratings downgrade of Puerto Rico&#146;s debt

municipalities amounted to $1.0 billion, of which approximately $811 million is outstanding ($1.2 billion and $950 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). Of the amount outstanding, $ 689&nbsp;million consists of loans and $ 122&nbsp;million are
securities ($789 million and $161 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). Of this amount, $336 million represents obligations from the Government of Puerto Rico and public corporations that are either collateralized loans or obligations that have a
specific source of income or revenues identified for their repayment ($527 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans to public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for
services or products, such as public utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from the central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from it. The remaining $475 million represents obligations from
various municipalities in Puerto Rico for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment ($423 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). These municipalities are
required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all of its general obligation bonds and loans. These loans have seniority to the payment of operating cost and expenses of the municipality. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:22pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In addition, at December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Corporation had $370 million in indirect exposure to loans or securities that are payable by
non-governmental entities, but which carry a government guarantee to cover any shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default ($360 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). These included $289 million in residential mortgage loans that are
guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (December 31, 2013 - $274 million). These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default.
Also, the Corporation had $49 million in Puerto Rico pass-through housing bonds backed by FNMA, GNMA or residential loans CMO&#146;s, and $32 million of industrial development notes ($52 million and $34 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013). </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into
a mortgage-backed security. In the past, we have retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December&nbsp;31, 2014, we serviced
$2.1 billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with FNMA and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, we are required to
repurchase the loan or reimburse the third party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is
equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2014, we repurchased approximately $89 million in mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse provisions. In
the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or
serviced with credit recourse amounted to $59 million. We may suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan
plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property. </P>

re-selling such loans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resulting from representations and warranty violations on specific portfolios. At December&nbsp;31, 2014, Popular&#146;s reserve for estimated

regulations under the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, including a final rule designating 2% as the designated reserve ratio and a final rule extending temporary unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest bearing transaction
accounts maintained in connection with lawyers&#146; trust accounts. On February&nbsp;7, 2011, the FDIC adopted regulations effective for the 2011 second quarter assessment and payable in September 2011, which outline significant changes in the
risk-based premiums approach for banks with over $10 billion of assets and creates a &#147;Scorecard&#148; system. The &#147;Scorecard&#148; system uses a performance score and loss severity score, which aggregate to an initial base assessment rate.
The assessment base also changes from deposits to an institution&#146;s average total assets minus its average tangible equity. For 2014, the FDIC deposit insurance expense of Popular totaled $40 million. </P>

regional operations in California, Illinois and Central Florida to three different buyers, resulting in the discontinuance of these businesses. In accordance with US&nbsp;GAAP, BPNA allocated a proportionate share of its goodwill balance to the
discontinued businesses on a relative fair value basis and performed an impairment test for the goodwill allocated to each of the discontinued operations as well as for retained business, each as a separate reporting unit. This allocation of
goodwill and related impairment analysis resulted in an impairment charge of $186.5 million during the second quarter of 2014. The goodwill impairment charge was a non-cash charge that did not have an impact on the Corporation&#146;s tangible

compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. In October 2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the
Federal Reserve Board, including Popular and our banking subsidiaries. The proposal sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage excessive
risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking
beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. The proposal also contemplates a detailed review by
the Federal Reserve Board of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of &#147;large, complex banking organizations.&#148; Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the
organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The proposal provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation
arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. Separately, the FDIC
has solicited comments on whether to amend its risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to potentially increase assessment rates on financial institutions with compensation programs that put the FDIC deposit insurance fund at risk, and
proposed legislation would subject compensation practices at financial institutions to heightened standards and increased scrutiny. </P>

These obligations and needs include capitalizing subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and BPNA, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other
distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial position.
Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business, may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market.

creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them
based on our below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute counterparties if any of our existing
agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. In addition, servicing, licensing and custodial agreements that we are party to with third parties include
ratings covenants. Servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings, the third parties could have the right to require
Popular to engage a substitute fund custodian and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post
collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $92 million at December&nbsp;31, 2014. We could be required to post additional
collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce
Popular&#146;s liquidity resources and impact its operating results. The termination of those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also
sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below investment grade.

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Under the Dodd-Frank Act, all financial companies with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as Popular, that are
supervised by a primary federal financial regulatory agency, are required to perform an annual stress test. This stress test supports the regulator&#146;s analysis of the adequacy of a banking organization&#146;s capital and is required as part of
Popular&#146;s capital management and review. The stress test is performed utilizing a variety of hypothetical stressed economic scenarios dictated by the Federal Reserve Board. If we are deemed to have inadequate capital under the hypothetical
scenarios, then our regulator could prohibit us from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends, or require us to increase our regulatory capital, including the issuance of common stock that would dilute the ownership of existing
shareholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The Basel III Capital Rules approved on July&nbsp;9, 2013 by the U.S. Federal Banking Regulatory Agencies
substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries. The Basel III Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as
modified certain asset risk weights and other matters affecting the numerator and denominator in a banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios thus implementing a new more complex methodology to calculate regulatory capital ratios. The
implementation of the new methodology will be phased-in over a 4-year period beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The need to maintain
more capital than has been historically required and calculated under revised standards could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also depress our return
on equity, thereby making it more difficult to earn our cost of capital. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased-in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account future expectations regarding the ability
of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stress conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividends and acquisitions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Due to the importance and complexity of the stress test process and new capital rules calculations under Basel III, we have dedicated
additional resources to comply with these requirements, however no assurance can be provided that these resources will be deemed sufficient or that we will be deemed to have adequate capital under the hypothetical economic stress scenarios thus
affecting our ability to take certain capital actions in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify"><B>Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have
the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as
possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control of the
Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire
Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two -thirds of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have the effect of
making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the
additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might
realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify"><B>The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have

affiliates, as well as EVERTEC, are obligated to comply with the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. These regulations prohibit U.S.- based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit
of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in
a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. Failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes may result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. In addition, various state and municipal governments,
universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business involving sanctioned countries or entities, and this could adversely affect the market for our securities. For these reasons, we have
established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. EVERTEC has also done this. These policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for
evidence of sanctioned-country and persons involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties in identifying all transactions of our customers&#146; customers that may involve a sanctioned country, there can be no assurance that
our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable U.S. laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Westernbank, which could present additional risks to our business. In that transaction, BPPR acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Westernbank from the FDIC in an assisted transaction. Although this transaction provides for FDIC
assistance to BPPR to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing exposure to loan losses (80% of the losses for a specified period in substantially all the acquired portfolio will be borne by the FDIC) and providing indemnification against certain
liabilities of the former Westernbank, we are still subject to some of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction. Such risks include risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to
realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect. In addition, because the FDIC-assisted transaction was structured in a manner that did not allow bidders the time and access to information normally

residential mortgage loans. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">With the acquisition of most of the former Westernbank&#146;s loan portfolio, the commercial real
estate loan and construction loan portfolios represent a larger portion of BPPR&#146;s total loan portfolio than prior to the FDIC-assisted transaction. This type of lending is generally considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional
single-family residential or consumer lending, because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful operation or completion of the related real estate or construction project. Consequently,
these loans are more sensitive to the current adverse conditions in the real estate market and the general economy. These loans are generally less predictable, more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and their collateral may be more difficult to
dispose of in a market decline. Furthermore, since these loans are to Puerto Rico based borrowers, Popular&#146;s credit exposure concentration in Puerto Rico increased as a result of the acquisition. Although, the negative economic aspects of these
risks are substantially reduced as a result of the FDIC loss sharing agreements, changes in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher loan charge-offs in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction all of which would not be
totally supported by the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We acquired significant portfolios of loans in the FDIC-assisted
transaction. Although these loan portfolios were initially accounted for at fair value, there is no assurance that there will not be additional charge-offs to this portfolio. The fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions,
including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level of charge-offs that we make to our loan portfolio, and consequently, reduce our net income, and may also increase the level of
charge-offs on the loan portfolio that we have acquired and correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if
other favorable events occur. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Although we have entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC which provide that 80% of losses
related to specified loan portfolios that we have acquired in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction will be borne by the FDIC, we are not protected for all losses resulting from charge-offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios.
Additionally, the loss sharing agreements have limited terms; therefore, any charge-off of related losses that we experience after the term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negatively impact our results of
operations. The loss sharing agreements also impose standard requirements on us which must be satisfied in order to retain loss share protections. The FDIC has the right to refuse or delay payment for loan losses if the loss sharing agreements are
not managed in accordance with their terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify"><B>Our decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate and our estimated loss
share indemnification asset in the FDIC-assisted transaction may be inaccurate, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loan portfolios, including the creditworthiness
of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In the FDIC-assisted transaction, we recorded a loss share indemnification asset that we consider adequate to absorb future
losses which may occur in the acquired loan portfolio. In determining the size of the loss share indemnification asset, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in
delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic
conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio. Any increase in future loan losses could have a negative effect on our operating results. However, in the event expected losses from the Westernbank portfolio were to increase more
than originally expected prior to the expiration of the applicable loss share periods, the related increase in loss reserves would be largely offset by higher than expected indemnity payments from the FDIC. To the extent that estimated losses on the
Westernbank portfolio are not realized before the expiration of the loss sharing agreements (June 30, 2015 for the commercial loss share agreement and June&nbsp;30, 2015 for the single-family loss share agreement), such losses would not be subject

difference related to the methodology for the computation of charge-offs for certain commercial late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans and OREO. In accordance with the terms of the
commercial loss share agreement, BPPR applied a methodology for charge-offs for late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans that conforms to its regulatory supervisory criteria and is calculated in accordance with BPPR&#146;s charge-off policy
for non-covered assets. The FDIC stated that it believed that BPPR should use a different methodology for those charge-offs. Notwithstanding the FDIC&#146;s refusal to reimburse BPPR for certain shared-loss claims, BPPR continued to calculate
shared-loss claims for quarters subsequent to June&nbsp;30, 2012 in accordance with its charge-off policy for non-covered assets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">BPPR&#146;s loss share agreements with the FDIC specify that disputes can be submitted to arbitration before a review board under the
commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. On July&nbsp;31, 2013, BPPR filed a statement of claims with the American Arbitration Association requesting that the review board determine certain matters relating to the
loss-share claims under its commercial loss share agreement with the FDIC, including that the review board award BPPR the amounts owed under its unpaid quarterly certificates. The statement of claim also included requests for reimbursement of
certain valuation adjustments for discounts to appraised values, costs to sell troubled assets and other items.&nbsp;The review board was comprised of one arbitrator appointed by BPPR, one arbitrator appointed by the FDIC and a third arbitrator
selected by agreement of those arbitrators. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">On October&nbsp;17, 2014, BPPR and the FDIC settled all claims and counterclaims that
had been submitted to the review board.&nbsp;The settlement provides for an agreed valuation methodology for reimbursement of charge-offs for late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans and resulting OREO.&nbsp;Although the terms of the
settlement could delay the timing of reimbursement of certain loss-share claims from the FDIC, the settlement is not expected to have a material adverse impact on BPPR&#146;s current estimate of expected reimbursable losses for the covered portfolio
through the end of the commercial loss share agreement in the quarter ending June&nbsp;30, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, BPPR
had unreimbursed losses and expenses of $299.4 million under the commercial loss share agreement with the FDIC.&nbsp;On January&nbsp;16, 2015, BPPR received reimbursement of $130.2 million from the FDIC covering claims filed prior to
December&nbsp;31, 2014.&nbsp;Taking into consideration this payment and claims submitted through that date, the total unreimbursed losses totaled $169.2 million, of which $30.1 million was submitted to the FDIC on January&nbsp;30, 2015.&nbsp;BPPR
continues to work on processing claims, including those which had previously not been reimbursed by the FDIC and expects to complete this process before the expiration of BPPR&#146;s ability to submit claims under the commercial loss share agreement
in the quarter ending June&nbsp;30, 2015.&nbsp;After giving effect to the claim submitted on January&nbsp;30, 2015, the amount of claims pending to be submitted for reimbursement to the FDIC amounted to $139.1 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">On November&nbsp;25, 2014, the FDIC notified BPPR that it (a)&nbsp;would not reimburse BPPR under the commercial loss share agreement for
a $66.6 million loss claim on eight related real estate loans that BPPR restructured and consolidated (collectively, the &#147;Disputed Asset&#148;), and (b)&nbsp;would no longer treat the Disputed Asset as a &#147;Shared-Loss Asset&#148; under the
commercial loss share agreement. The FDIC alleged that BPPR&#146;s restructure and modification of the underlying loans did not constitute a &#147;Permitted Amendment&#148; under the commercial loss share agreement, thereby causing the bank to
breach Article III of the commercial loss share agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">BPPR disagrees with the FDIC&#146;s determinations relating to the
Disputed Asset, and accordingly, on December&nbsp;19, 2014, delivered to the FDIC a notice of dispute under the commercial loss share agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The commercial loss share agreement provides that certain disputes be submitted to arbitration before a review board, to include two
party-appointed members, under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. BPPR and the FDIC have agreed that, if they are not able to resolve their disputes concerning the Disputed Asset through negotiation prior to
March&nbsp;13, 2015, they will name their respective party-appointed members of the review board on March&nbsp;16, 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">To the
extent we are not able to successfully resolve this matter through negotiation or the arbitration process described above, a write-off in the amount of approximately $53.3 million of the aforementioned pending claims would be recorded. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In addition, in November and December 2014, BPPR proposed separate portfolio sales to the FDIC. The FDIC has refused to consent to either
sale, stating that those sales did not represent best efforts to maximize collections on shared-loss assets under the commercial loss share agreement. We dispute that characterization, and negotiations are continuing. </P>

numbers and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the
