</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to
Popular, PIB, PNA and their respective subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be
complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and
regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their application by

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>General</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular, PIB and PNA are bank holding companies subject to consolidated supervision and
regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. Under the BHC Act, prior to the adoption
of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, the activities of bank holding companies and their
non-banking subsidiaries were limited to the business of banking and activities closely related to
banking, and no bank holding company could directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of
more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company in the
United States, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In
addition, bank holding companies generally have been prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in
non-banking activities, unless they were found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related
to banking. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act authorizes bank holding companies that qualify as &#147;financial
holding companies&#148; to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking activities, subject to
certain conditions. Popular has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the
provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. See &#147;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&#148; below for information
regarding these rules. The BHC Act, as amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to supervision and examination by applicable federal and
state banking agencies including, in the case of Banco Popular, the Federal Reserve Board and the
Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (the &#147;Office of the
Commissioner&#148;), and in the case of BPNA, the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking
Department. Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to requirements and restrictions under federal and
state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types
and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon, and
limitations on the other types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may
be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of Banco Popular and
BPNA. See &#147;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&#148; below for information about these rules. In addition to the
impact of regulations, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal

influence the economy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Prompt Corrective Action</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDIA&#148;) requires, among other things, the federal
banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of insured depository institutions
that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital tiers: &#147;well
capitalized&#148;, &#147;adequately capitalized&#148;, &#147;undercapitalized&#148;, &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;, and
&#147;critically undercapitalized&#148;. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital
ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies provide that an insured depository institution
will be deemed to be (1)&nbsp;well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and is
not subject to any written agreement or directive to meet a specific capital level; (2)&nbsp;adequately
capitalized, if it is not well capitalized, but maintains a leverage ratio of at least 4% (or at
least 3% if given the highest regulatory rating in its most recent report of examination and not
experiencing or anticipating significant growth), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4%
and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%; (3)&nbsp;undercapitalized if it fails to meet the
standards for adequately capitalized institutions (unless it is deemed significantly or critically
undercapitalized); (4)&nbsp;significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than 3%, a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than
6%; and (5)&nbsp;critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to 2% or less of total
assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, Banco Popular and BPNA were both well-capitalized. An institution&#146;s
capital category, as determined by applying the prompt corrective action provisions of law, may not
constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of the
institution, and the capital condition of our banking subsidiaries should be considered in
conjunction with other available information regarding our financial condition and results of
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well
capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The appropriate agency is
also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with
the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a
significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory
information other than the capital levels of the institution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified, if the appropriate federal banking
agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe
or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital
distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company,
if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository
institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition,
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to
submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the
capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at
the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution
fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without
determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to
succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to
submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly
undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and
restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized,
requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or
conservator.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to the
FDIC -insured depository institutions such as Banco Popular and BPNA, but
they are not directly applicable to holding companies such as Popular, PIB and PNA, which control
such institutions. However, the federal banking agencies have indicated that, in regulating holding

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer
of funds by any of them to Popular, PIB, PNA, or any of our other non-banking subsidiaries, whether
in the form of loans, other extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases. Such transfers by
Banco Popular and BPNA to any of Popular, PIB, PNA, or any of our other non-banking subsidiaries
are limited in amount to 10% of the transferring institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus and, with
respect to Popular and all of our non-banking subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the
transferring institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus. For these purposes an institution&#146;s capital
stock and surplus includes its total risk-based capital plus (1)&nbsp;the balance of its allowance for
loan losses not included therein and (2)&nbsp;the amount of certain investments made by the institution
in &#147;financial subsidiaries&#148; that is subject to these limits and is required to be deducted from the
institution&#146;s capital for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, any such loans and extensions
of credit are required to be secured in specified amounts. In addition, federal law requires that
any transaction between Banco Popular or BPNA, on the one hand, and Popular, PIB, PNA or any of our
other non-banking subsidiaries, on the other hand, be carried out on an arm&#146;s length basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company such as Popular, PIB or PNA is
expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit
resources to support each subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when, absent such
policy, the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support. In addition, any capital
loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository institutions are subordinated
in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository
institution. In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank
holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository
institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. Banco
Popular and BPNA are currently the only insured depository institution subsidiaries of Popular, PIB
and PNA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Popular, PIB and PNA are holding companies, their right to participate in the assets
of any subsidiary upon the latter&#146;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior
claims of the subsidiary&#146;s creditors (including depositors in the case of subsidiary depository
institutions) except to the extent that Popular, PIB or PNA, as the case may be, may itself be a
creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the FDIA, a depository institution, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, can
be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in
connection with (i)&nbsp;the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or
(ii)&nbsp;any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository
institution &#147;in danger of default&#148;. &#147;Default&#148; is defined generally as the appointment of a
conservator or a receiver, and &#147;in danger of default&#148; is defined generally as the existence of
certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory
assistance. Banco Popular and BPNA are currently FDIC-insured depository institution subsidiaries
of Popular and are subject to this cross-guarantee liability. In some circumstances (depending upon
the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the FDIC), cross-guarantee liability may
result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more insured depository institutions in a
holding company structure. Any obligation or liability owed by a subsidiary depository institution
to its parent company and other affiliates is subordinated to the subsidiary depository
institution&#146;s cross-guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository
institutions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Dividend Restrictions</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal sources of funding for the holding companies have included dividends received
from its banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of
medium-term notes, junior subordinated debentures and equity. Various statutory provisions limit
the amount of dividends Banco Popular may pay to Popular without regulatory approval. As a member
bank subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, Banco Popular must obtain the approval
of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all dividends declared by the member
bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income (as reportable in its Report
of Condition and Income) for that year, combined with its retained net income (as defined by
regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for
the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend
in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income,
unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also
may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been
approved by the Federal Reserve Board. For this purpose, permanent capital means the total of the
bank&#146;s perpetual preferred stock and related surplus, common stock and surplus and minority
interests in consolidated subsidiaries, as reportable in the Report of Condition and Income. At
December&nbsp;31, 2009, Banco Popular and BPNA could not declare any dividends without the approval of
the Federal Reserve Board.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment of dividends by Banco Popular and BPNA may also be affected by other regulatory
requirements and policies, such as the maintenance of adequate capital. If, in the opinion of the
applicable regulatory authority, a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or
is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (that, depending on the financial condition of
the depository institution, could include the payment of dividends), such authority may require,
after notice and hearing, that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice. The
FDIC has indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">practice if the payment would deplete a depository institution&#146;s capital base to an inadequate
level. Under the FDIA, an insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to
become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. See &#147;Prompt Corrective Action&#148; above.
Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that the
bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current
operating earnings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends
on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only
if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#146;s current
and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, under
Federal Reserve Board policy, bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that place
undue pressure on the capital of depository institution subsidiaries or that may undermine the bank
holding company&#146;s ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal
Reserve Board could prohibit a dividend by Popular, PIB or PNA that would constitute an unsafe or
unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. In the
current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank
holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged dividend
pay-out ratios that are at the 100% or higher level unless both asset quality and capital are very
strong. Popular is also subject to dividend restrictions because of
our participation in the TARP
Capital Purchase Program. For further information please refer to Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;5, &#147;Market for
Registrant&#146;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, subject to compliance with certain conditions,
distributions of U.S. sourced dividends to a corporation organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are subject to a withholding tax of 10% instead of the 30% applied to
other foreign corporations. This 2004 law lowering the withholding tax rate to 10% is not expected
to have a material impact on Popular in the foreseeable future.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. In 2006 the
President signed the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the &#147;Reform Act&#148;). The Reform
Act provided for the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund (&#147;BIF&#148;) and Savings Association Insurance
Fund (&#147;SAIF&#148;) into a single Deposit Insurance Fund, an increase in the maximum amount of FDIC
insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts, and possible &#147;inflation adjustments&#148; in the
maximum amount of coverage available with respect to other insured accounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deposits of Banco Popular, excluding the deposits of the branch located in the British
Virgin Islands, and BPNA are insured up to the applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are
subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Reform Act, the FDIC made significant changes to its risk-based assessment system so
that effective January&nbsp;1, 2007 the FDIC imposes insurance premiums based upon a matrix that is
designed to more closely tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;3, 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act of 2008 (&#147;EESA&#148;), which temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit
insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. The temporary increase in deposit
insurance coverage became effective upon the President&#146;s signature. The legislation provides, that
the basic deposit insurance limit returned to $100,000 after December&nbsp;31, 2009, however on May
2009, the FDIC extended the $250,000 coverage per depositor until December&nbsp;31, 2013. The
legislation did not increase coverage for retirement accounts, which continues to be $250,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;16, 2008, the Board of Directors of the FDIC voted to adopt a final rule
increasing risk-based assessment rates uniformly by seven basis points, on an annual basis, for the
first quarter of 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;27, 2009, the Board of Directors of the FDIC voted to adopt a final rule to alter
the way in which the FDIC&#146;s risk-based assessment system differentiates for risk, change deposit
insurance assessment rates, and make technical and other changes to the rules governing the
risk-based assessment system. Under this final rule, risk-based rates are ranging between 12 and 45
cents per $100 of domestic deposits (annualized)&nbsp;and between 7 and 77.5 cents per $100 of domestic
deposits after adjustments. Most institutions are being charged between 7 and 24 cents per $100 of
deposits, after adjustments. Also, in May&nbsp;2009, the FDIC adopted
a final rule, effective June&nbsp;30, 2009, that imposed a special assessment of 5 cents for every $100
on each insured depository institution&#146;s assets minus its Tier 1 Capital as of June&nbsp;30, 2009,
subject to a cap equal to 10 cents per $100 of assessable deposits for the second quarter 2009
risk-based capital assessment. The special assessment was collected on September&nbsp;30, 2009. For us
this special assessment represented an expense of $16.7&nbsp;million,
in the second quarter of 2009. In 2009 the FDIC assessment premiums of
our insured depository institutions totaled $76.8&nbsp;million,
including the previously mentioned special assessment paid in
September 2009 of $16.7&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on November&nbsp;2009, the Board of Directors of the FDIC voted to require insured
institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, as
well as, for all 2010, 2011, and 2012. Each quarter, the FDIC will bill insured institutions for

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">the actual risk-based premium for that quarter. Such amounts will reduce the prepaid asset.
Once the asset is exhausted, banks will resume paying and accounting for quarterly deposit
insurance assessments as they did prior to the implementation of this rule. The FDIC decided that
if the prepayment is not exhausted by June&nbsp;30, 2013, any remaining amount will be returned to the
insured institutions. The prepayment allows the FDIC to strengthen the cash position of the DIF
immediately, without immediately impacting earnings of the industry. In December&nbsp;30, 2009, Popular
prepaid $221&nbsp;million, which includes all of our quarterly assessments, typically paid one quarter
in arrears, for the calendar quarters ending December&nbsp;31, 2009
through December&nbsp;31, 2012.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in January&nbsp;2010, the FDIC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
seeking comment on ways that the FDIC&#146;s risk-based deposit insurance assessment system could be
changed to account for the risks posed by certain employee compensation programs. Rulemaking as a
result of this review could result in further assessments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;21, 2008, the Board of Directors of the FDIC approved the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (&#147; TLGP&#148;) to strengthen
confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. The TLGP is comprised of the Debt
Guarantee Program (&#147;DGP&#148;) and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (&#147;TAGP&#148;). We opted to
become a participating entity on both of these programs. However, no debt was issued by Popular
under the DGP, and no new FDIC-guaranteed debt can be issued under the DGP after October&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TAGP offers a full guarantee for non-interest-bearing transaction deposit accounts held by
Popular. The unlimited deposit coverage is in addition to the $250,000 FDIC deposit insurance per
depositor that was included as part of the EESA. As a result of our participation in the TAGP, we
are required to pay quarterly, additional insurance premiums to the FDIC in an amount equal to an
annualized 10 cents per $100 fee on balances in non-interest-bearing transaction accounts that
exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of $250,000. The TAGP deposit coverage is available
until June&nbsp;30, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 separated the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;)
assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the DIF assessment. The amount
assessed on individual institutions by the FICO is in addition to the amount paid for deposit
insurance according to the FDIC&#146;s risk-related assessment rate schedules. The FICO assessment rate
for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 1.02 cents per $100 of deposits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had a DIF deposit assessment base of approximately $26&nbsp;billion and
a TAGP deposit assessment base of approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Brokered Deposits</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FDIA governs the receipt of brokered deposits. Section&nbsp;29 of FDIA and the regulations adopted
thereunder restrict the use of brokered deposits and the rate of interest payable on deposits for
institutions that are less than well capitalized. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is
well capitalized. Popular does not believe the brokered deposits regulation has had or will have a
material effect on the funding or liquidity of Banco Popular and BPNA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Capital Adequacy</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information about our capital composition as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and for the four
previous years is presented in Table I &#147;Capital Adequacy Data&#148; on page 43 in the MD&#038;A.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and
member banks, the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital (&#147;Total Capital&#148;) to risk-weighted
assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. Under
the capital guidelines, a banking organization&#146;s Total Capital is divided into tiers. &#147;Tier 1
Capital&#148; consists of common equity, retained earnings, minority interests in equity accounts of
consolidated subsidiaries, (including for bank holding companies but not banks, trust preferred
securities), qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies
(but not banks) a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock less goodwill
(net of any associated deferred tax liability) and certain other intangible assets. Banking
organizations are expected to maintain at least 50&nbsp;percent of their Tier 1 Capital as common
equity. Not more than 25% of qualifying Tier 1 Capital may consist of non-cumulative perpetual
preferred stock, trust preferred securities or other &#147;so-called&#148; restricted core capital elements.
In addition, effective October&nbsp;17, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board approved an interim rule to
allow the inclusion of the senior perpetual preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the
Troubled Asset Relief Program (&#147;TARP&#148;) Capital Purchase Program, without limit, as Tier 1 Capital. &#147;Tier 2 Capital&#148; consists of,
among other things, a limited amount of subordinated debt, other preferred stock, certain other
instruments and a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for
bank holding companies and member banks. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1
Capital to total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (the
&#147;leverage ratio&#148;) of 3% for bank holding companies and member banks that have the highest
regulatory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s market risk capital measure. All
other bank holding companies and member banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of
4%. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making
acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum
supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to the risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted
by the Federal Reserve Board. See Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 25 &#147;Regulatory Capital
Requirements&#148; on page 138 and 139 for the capital ratios of Popular, Banco Popular and BPNA.
Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject Popular and our depository institution
subsidiaries to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance
by the FDIC and to certain restrictions on our business. See &#147;- Prompt Corrective Action&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, our restricted core capital elements would have exceeded the 25%
limitation and, as such, $7&nbsp;million of the outstanding trust preferred securities were disallowed
as Tier 1 Capital. Amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of this limit generally
may be included in Tier 2 capital, subject to further limitations. The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s
risk-based capital guidelines revised the quantitative limit which would limit restricted core
capital elements included in the Tier 1 Capital of a bank holding company to 25% of the sum of core
capital elements (including restricted core capital elements), net of goodwill less any associated
deferred tax liability. These new quantitative limits were scheduled to become effective on March
31, 2009. However, on March&nbsp;23, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a rule extending the
compliance date for the tighter limits to March&nbsp;31, 2011 in light of the stressful financial
conditions and the severely constrained ability of bank holding companies to raise additional
capital in the markets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, $842&nbsp;million in trust preferred securities that
Popular treated as Tier 1 Capital under existing Federal Reserve Board guidelines were outstanding.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the U.S. Government&#146;s Financial Stability Plan, on February&nbsp;25, 2009, the U.S.
Treasury announced preliminary details of its Capital Assistance Program, or the &#147;CAP.&#148; To
implement the CAP, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Banks, the FDIC and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency commenced a review, referred to as the Supervisory Capital
Assessment Program (the &#147;SCAP&#148;), of the capital of the 19 largest U.S. banking institutions.
Popular was not included in the group of 19 banking institutions reviewed under the SCAP. On May&nbsp;7,
2009, Federal banking regulators announced the results of the SCAP and determined that 10 of the 19
banking institutions were required to raise additional capital and to submit a capital plan to
their Federal banking regulators by June&nbsp;8, 2009 for their review.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though we were not one of the banking institutions included in the SCAP, we have closely
assessed the announced SCAP results, particularly noting that (1)&nbsp;the SCAP credit loss assumptions
applied to regional banking institutions included in the SCAP are based on a more adverse economic
and credit scenario and (2)&nbsp;Federal banking regulators are focused on the composition of regulatory
capital. Specifically, the regulators have indicated that voting common equity should be the
dominant element of Tier 1 capital and have established a 4% Tier 1 common/risk-weighted assets
ratio as a threshold for determining capital needs. Although the SCAP results are not applicable to
us, they do express general regulatory expectations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Popular has been well capitalized based on a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
assets, we believe that an improvement in the composition of our regulatory capital, including Tier
1 common equity, will better position us in a more adverse economic and credit scenario. As a
result, during the third quarter of 2009 we completed the exchange offer in order to increase our
common equity capital to accommodate the more adverse economic and credit scenarios assumed under
the SCAP as applied to regional banking institutions. With the exchange offer we increased our
Tier 1 common equity by $1.4&nbsp;billion. For more information about the exchange please refer to Part
II, Item&nbsp;5, &#147;Market for Registrant&#146;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities &#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#147;Basel Committee&#148;) published a new
set of risk-based capital standards (&#147;Basel II&#148;) in order to update the original international
capital standards that had been put in place in 1988 (&#147;Basel I&#148;). Basel II presents a three-pillar
framework for determining risk-based capital requirements for credit risk, market risk and
operational risk (Pillar 1); supervisory review of capital adequacy (Pillar 2); and market
discipline through enhanced public disclosure (Pillar 3). A definitive final rule for implementing
the advanced approaches of Basel II in the United States, which applies only to certain large or
internationally active or &#147;core&#148; banking organizations (defined as those with consolidated total
assets of $250&nbsp;billion or more or consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposures of $10&nbsp;billion or
more) became effective on April&nbsp;1, 2008. Other U.S. banking organizations may elect to adopt the
requirements of this rule (if they meet applicable qualification requirements), but are not
required to comply. The rule also allows a banking organization&#146;s primary Federal supervisor to
determine that application of the rule would not be appropriate in light of the bank&#146;s asset size,
level of complexity, risk profile or scope of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To correct differences between core and non-core banking organizations, Basel IA was proposed
in late 2006 presenting modifications to the general risk-based capital rules for non-core banking
organizations that do not adopt the advanced approaches. After considering the comments on both the
Basel IA and the advanced approaches, in July&nbsp;2008, the agencies proposed a new rule that would
provide all non-core banking organizations with an option to adopt the standardized approach under
Basel II. This alternative provides a more risk sensitive capital framework to institutions not
adopting the advanced approaches without unduly increasing regulatory burden. Comments on the
proposed rule were due to the agencies by October&nbsp;27, 2008, but a definitive final rule has not
been issued.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Popular is a non-core banking organization, we understand that the new capital
adequacy guidelines provide a framework which more closely aligns regulatory capital requirements
with actual risks, thus enhancing risk management practices.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2009, the Basel Committee issued two consultative documents proposing reforms to
bank capital and liquidity regulation. The Basel Committee&#146;s capital proposals would significantly
revise the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Among other things, they would: (i)
re-emphasize that common equity is the &#147;predominant&#148; component of Tier 1 capital by (a)&nbsp;adding a
minimum common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio, with the ratio itself to be determined based
on the outcome of an impact study that the Basel Committee is conducting, and (b)&nbsp;requiring that
goodwill, general intangibles and certain other items that currently must be deducted from Tier 1
capital instead be deducted from common equity as a component of Tier 1 capital; (ii)&nbsp;disqualify
innovative capital instruments &#151; including U.S.-style trust preferred securities and other
instruments that effectively pay cumulative dividends &#151; from Tier 1 capital status; (iii)
strengthen the risk coverage of the capital framework, particularly with respect to counterparty
credit risk exposures arising from derivatives, repos and securities financing activities; (iv)
introduce a leverage ratio requirement as an international standard; and (v)&nbsp;implement measures to
promote the build-up of capital buffers in good times that can be drawn upon during periods of
stress, introducing a countercyclical component designed to address the concern that existing
capital requirements are procyclical &#151; that is, they encourage reducing capital buffers in good
times, when capital could more easily be raised, and increasing capital buffers in times of
distress, when access to capital markets may be limited or they may effectively be closed. The
capital proposals do not specify a percentage for the new ratio of common equity to risk-weighted
assets or changes in the current minimum Tier 1 capital and total capital risk-based capital
requirements, which currently are 4% and 8%, respectively. Instead, they state that the minimum
percentage requirements for the new ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets and the other
capital ratios &#151; including Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted
assets and the new leverage ratio &#151; will be included in a &#147;fully calibrated, comprehensive set&#148; of
capital and liquidity proposals to be released by December&nbsp;31, 2010. Independently, in September
2009, the Department of the Treasury issued a policy statement titled &#147;Principles for Reforming the
U.S. and International Regulatory Capital Framework for Banking Firms&#148; setting forth core
principles intended to address many of the same substantive items as the Basel Committee capital
proposals and specifically calling for increased capital requirements for financial institutions,
and &#147;substantially heightened&#148; capital requirements for large financial institutions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If implemented, the Basel Committee&#146;s liquidity proposals, although apparently similar in many
respects to tests historically applied by banking organizations and regulators for management and
supervisory purposes, would for the first time be formulaic and required by regulation. They would
impose two measures of liquidity risk exposure, one based on a 30-day time horizon and the other
addressing longer-term structural liquidity mismatches over a one-year time period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basel Committee indicated that it expects final provisions responsive to the proposals to
be implemented by December&nbsp;31, 2012. Ultimate implementation in individual countries, including the
United States, is subject to the discretion of the bank regulators in those countries. The Basel
Committee&#146;s final proposals may differ from the proposals released in December&nbsp;2009, and the
regulations and guidelines adopted by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over Popular and
our subsidiaries may differ from the final accord of the Basel Committee. Moreover, although some
aspects of the Basel Committee proposals were quite specific (e.g., the definition of the
components of capital), others were merely conceptual (e.g., the description of the leverage test)
and others not specifically addressed (e.g., the minimum percentages for required capital ratios).
We are not able to predict at this time the content of guidelines or regulations that will
ultimately be adopted by regulatory agencies having authority over Popular and our subsidiaries or
the impact of changes in capital and liquidity regulation upon us. However, a requirement that
Popular and our depository institution subsidiaries maintain more capital, with common equity as a
more predominant component, or manage the configuration of their assets and liabilities in order to
comply with formulaic liquidity requirements, could significantly impact our financial condition,
operations, capital position and ability to pursue business opportunities.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Interstate Banking Legislation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended (the
&#147;Interstate Banking Act&#148;), generally permits a bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board
approval, to acquire banks located in states other than the holding company&#146;s home state without
regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law. In addition, national and state
banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines, with approval of the
appropriate federal banking agency. States are also allowed to permit de novo interstate branching.
Once a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank
may establish or acquire additional branches at any location in the state where any bank involved
in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable
federal or state law. A bank that has established a branch in a state through de novo branching (if
permitted under state laws) may establish and acquire additional branches in such state in the same
manner and to the same extent as a bank having a branch in such state as a result of an interstate
merger. If a state opted out of interstate branching within the specified time period, no bank in
any other state may establish a branch in the state that has opted out, whether through an
acquisition or de novo. For purposes of the Interstate Banking Act, Banco Popular is treated as a
state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks.
However, for purposes of the International Banking Act (the &#147;IBA&#148;), Banco Popular is considered to
be a foreign bank and may branch interstate by merger or de novo to the same extent as a domestic
bank in Banco Popular&#146;s home state, which is New York for purposes of the IBA.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was enacted on November&nbsp;12, 1999. Among other things, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: (i)&nbsp;allows bank holding companies whose subsidiary depository institutions
meet management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially
broader range of nonbanking financial activities than what was previously permissible, including
securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments
in nonfinancial companies; (ii)&nbsp;allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire
banks; (iii)&nbsp;removes various restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership
of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and (iv)&nbsp;establishes the overall regulatory
structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a bank holding company to engage in the broader range of activities that are
permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (i)&nbsp;all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be
well capitalized (as described above), and well managed and (ii)&nbsp;it must file a declaration with
the Federal Reserve Board that it elects to be a &#147;financial holding company.&#148; Popular, PIB and PNA
have elected to be treated as financial holding companies. A depository institution is deemed to be
&#147;well managed&#148; if at its most recent inspection, examination or subsequent review by the
appropriate federal banking agency (or the appropriate state banking agency), the depository
institution received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; composite rating and at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148;
rating for management. In addition, to commence any new activity permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and to acquire any company engaged in any new activities permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding
company must have received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating in its most recent examination under
the Community Reinvestment Act. If, after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking
activities not permissible for a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company, the
company fails to continue to meet any of the capital or managerial requirements for financial
holding company status, the company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to
comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to
compliance within 180&nbsp;days, the Federal Reserve Board may order the company to divest its
subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue, or divest investments in companies engaged in,
activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a
financial holding company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries
to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the
Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such
ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of
any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also modified other laws, including laws related to financial
privacy and community reinvestment. These financial privacy provisions generally prohibit financial
institutions, including our bank subsidiaries, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial
information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to &#147;opt out&#148; of the disclosure.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has
been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the
&#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;) broadened the application of U.S. anti-money laundering regulations to apply to
additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers, investment advisors and
insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to help prevent, detect
and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act imposed significant new compliance and due diligence
obligations, created new crimes and penalties and expanded the extra-territorial jurisdiction of
the United States. The principal provisions of Title III and regulations issued by the U.S.
Treasury thereunder impose obligations on financial institutions, including Popular&#146;s bank and
broker-dealer subsidiaries, to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect,
prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of
customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial
institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial
institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act&#146;s
requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to help serve the credit needs of their
communities, including credit to low and moderate-income individuals and geographies. Should
Popular or our bank subsidiaries fail to serve adequately the community, potential penalties may
include regulatory denials of applications to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated
foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#147;OFAC&#148; rules based on

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;). The
OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they
contain one or more of the following elements: (i)&nbsp;restrictions on trade with or investment in a
sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a
sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#147;U.S. persons&#148; engaging in financial transactions relating
to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to a sanctioned
country; and (ii)&nbsp;a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of
the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S.
jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets
(e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any
manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal
and reputational consequences.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various other legislative proposals, including proposals to limit the investments that a
depository institution may make with FDIC insured funds to restrict certain practices in connection
with lending activities, to require lenders to forego certain contractual rights, to amend
bankruptcy laws or to restrict executive compensation, are from time to time introduced in
Congress. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that such potential legislation, if enacted, or

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>General. </I></B>As a commercial bank organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, Banco Popular is
subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Office of the Commissioner, pursuant to
the Puerto Rico Banking Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Banking Law&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the yearly net
income of Banco Popular be credited annually to a reserve fund. This apportionment must be done
every year until the reserve fund is equal to the total of paid-in capital on common and preferred
stock. During 2009, Banco Popular transferred $10&nbsp;million to the reserve fund in order to comply
with this requirement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater
than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the
undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve
fund. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the
outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared
until capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original
capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve that, except as
otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less than 20% of its demand
liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by
collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a state of the United
States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that
state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the
reserve requirements of Section&nbsp;16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated
November&nbsp;24, 1982, Banco Popular has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal
Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, Banco Popular is
subject to the reserve requirements prescribed by the Banking Law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to any one person, firm,
partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of fifteen percent (15%) of the paid-in
capital and reserve fund of the bank. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the legal lending limit for the Bank
under this provision was approximately $124&nbsp;million. In the case of loans which are secured by
collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan the maximum aggregate amount is
increased to one third of the paid-in capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the
institution is well capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the
Office of the Commissioner or any regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15%
of 50% of its undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than
the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided
profits. Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional
component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the
Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section&nbsp;17 on the amount of loans that are wholly
secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United
States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or
instrumentalities of Puerto Rico.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;14 of the Banking Law authorizes a bank to conduct certain financial and related
activities directly or through subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal property and
originating and servicing mortgage loans. Banco Popular engages in these activities through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Popular Auto, Inc. and Popular Mortgage, Inc., respectively, both
companies are organized and operate in Puerto Rico.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Board is composed of nine members, including the Commissioner of Financial
Institutions, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Economic and Commercial Development,
the Secretary of Consumer Affairs, the President of the Economic Development Bank, the President of
the Planning Board, the President of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, the Executive

securities convertible into additional shares of capital stock unless such shares are issued
directly to the shareholders of PIB previously identified in the application to organize the
international banking entity, in which case notification to the Office of the Commissioner must be

operation on a quarterly basis and its annual audited financial statements at the close of its
fiscal year. Under the IBC Act, PIB may not deal with &#147;domestic persons&#148; as such term is defined in
the IBC Act. Also, it may only engage in those activities authorized in the IBC Act, the
regulations adopted thereunder and its license.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IBC Act empowers the Office of the Commissioner to revoke or suspend, after a hearing, the
license of an international banking entity (&#147;IBE&#148;) if, among other things, it fails to comply with
the IBC Act, regulations issued by the Office of the Commissioner or the terms of its license or if
the Office of the Commissioner finds that the business of the IBE is conducted in a manner not
consistent with the public interest.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An IBE that operates as a division or branch of a bank in Puerto Rico is subject to income tax
in Puerto Rico if its net taxable income exceeds 20% of the net taxable income of the bank as a
whole. If these thresholds are exceeded, the IBE will be taxed at regular tax rates on its net
taxable income that exceeds the applicable threshold. In March&nbsp;2009, the Government of Puerto Rico
approved a legislation that imposed a 5% income tax on the net income of the IBE that operates as
separate entity, even though do not exceed the 20% threshold.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our corporate structure consists of three reportable segments &#151; Banco Popular, BPNA and
EVERTEC. These reportable segments pertain only to the continuing operations of Popular. The
operations of PFH which were considered a reportable segment prior to 2008 were classified as
discontinued operations in 2008 through September&nbsp;30, 2009. A corporate group has been defined to
support the reportable segments. Popular retrospectively adjusted the 2007 information in the

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Doral Announcements. </I></B>In April&nbsp;2005, Doral Financial Corporation (&#147;Doral&#148;) announced that its
previously filed financial statements for periods from January&nbsp;1, 2000 through December&nbsp;31, 2004
should no longer be relied on and that the financial statements for some or all of the periods
included therein should be restated because of issues relating to the methodology used to calculate
the fair value of its portfolio of floating rate interest-only strips (&#147;IOs&#148;). On February&nbsp;27,
2006, Doral filed a Form 10-K/A (Amendment No.&nbsp;1) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 (the
&#147;Amended Doral 2004 10-K&#148;). In the Amended Doral 2004 10-K, Doral stated that it was reducing its
retained earnings through December&nbsp;31, 2004 by $921&nbsp;million on a pre-tax basis and that $596
million of the $921&nbsp;million reduction was attributable to recharacterization of mortgage loan sales
transactions as secured borrowings and $283&nbsp;million was attributable to valuation of IOs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, Doral announced that the SEC had approved a
final settlement with Doral, which resolved the SEC&#146;s investigation of Doral. Doral has also stated
that the U.S. Attorney&#146;s Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an
investigation of these matters. Actions were brought by or on behalf of securities holders of Doral
in relation to these matters. In April&nbsp;2007, Doral agreed to a settlement in which Doral and its
insurers agreed to pay an aggregate of $129&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Estimates of Value Provided by Popular Securities. </I></B>Between October&nbsp;2002 and December&nbsp;2004,
Popular Securities, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Popular, provided quarterly estimates of the
value of portfolios of IOs on behalf of Doral. In accordance with its understanding regarding the
engagement, in providing those estimates of value, Popular Securities utilized assumptions provided
by Doral that may not have been consistent with the actual terms of the IO portfolios. As
originally filed on March&nbsp;15, 2005, Doral&#146;s Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 stated
that &#147;to determine the fair value of its IO portfolio&#148;, Doral engaged a &#147;party&#148; to provide an

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&#147;external valuation&#148; that &#147;consists of a cash flow valuation model in which all economic and
portfolio assumptions are determined by the preparer&#148;. Popular Securities believes that this
characterization is not appropriate if it was meant to apply to Popular Securities&#146; work.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Amended Doral 2004 10-K, Doral stated that counsel for its Audit Committee and
independent directors had investigated the process it used to obtain &#147;third-party IO valuations&#148;,
that the investigation had concluded that the process &#147;was flawed&#148;, that Doral representatives &#147;may
have improperly provided inaccurate information&#148; concerning the IO portfolio to the parties
performing the third-party valuation, and that the counsel conducting the investigation had
&#147;limited access to the third parties who performed the IO valuation.&#148; We believe that Doral
considers Popular Securities to be one of the parties that provided Doral with &#147;third-party IO
valuations.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Transactions with Doral Relating to Mortgage Loans and IOs. </I></B>Between 1996 and 2004, Banco Popular
purchased mortgage loans from Doral for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion.
The remaining balance of these mortgage loans recorded on our consolidated statement of condition
at December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $284&nbsp;million.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first six months of 2000, Popular sold mortgage loans to Doral Bank, a subsidiary of
Doral, in two transactions, each for an aggregate sale price of $100&nbsp;million, and entered into two
agreements, contemporaneously with the sale agreements, to purchase mortgage loans from Doral, each
for an aggregate purchase price of $100&nbsp;million. We recorded a gain of $2.2&nbsp;million in the first
quarter of 2000 and of $1.9&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2000 from the sales of mortgages to
Doral Bank.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchases of mortgage loans from Doral for an aggregate price of $1.6&nbsp;billion were often
accompanied by separate recourse and other financial arrangements. The sale of mortgages to Doral
Bank for an aggregate purchase price of $200&nbsp;million was accompanied by separate recourse
arrangements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;15, 2005, Doral announced that it was reversing &#147;a number of transactions
involving the generally contemporaneous purchase and sale of mortgage loans from and to local
financial institutions,&#148; including &#147;transactions covering the purchase and sale of approximately
$200&nbsp;million in mortgages with a local financial institution during 2000&#148; because Doral&#146;s Audit
Committee determined that there was &#147;insufficient contemporaneous documentation regarding the
business purpose for these transactions in light of the timing and similarity of the purchase and
sale amounts and the other terms of the transactions.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the December&nbsp;15, 2005 release, Doral stated that it was treating the sales of mortgage
loans by it as &#147;loans payable secured by mortgage loans.&#148; We believe that the contemporaneous
purchases and sales of mortgage loans entered into by us were the ones reversed by Doral.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular has reviewed the foregoing mortgage loan purchase and sale transactions, as well as
the public statements by Doral, and believes that the transactions qualify for sale (or in the case
of purchases, purchase) treatment under the financial accounting standard at that time.
Accordingly, it has not reversed any of these transactions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1996 and 2004, we purchased IOs from Doral for an aggregate purchase price of $110
million. Over the same period Doral repurchased IOs it had previously sold to us for an aggregate
purchase price of $54&nbsp;million. The remaining balance of these IOs recorded on our consolidated
statement of condition at December&nbsp;31, 2009 was $27&nbsp;million. These IOs have been reclassified from
investments available-for-sale to loans to Doral because they are accompanied by 100% guarantees
from Doral of the principal and the fixed yield and because of the source of the cash flow for
payments on the IOs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Amended Doral 2004 10-K, Doral stated that Doral had &#147;failed to detect, document and
communicate certain side agreements entered into by Doral&#146;s former treasurer guaranteeing a fixed
yield to a purchaser&#148; of its IOs and that this failure &#147;resulted in the improper accounting for
these transactions as sales and the associated improper recognition of gains on sales.&#148; Doral
stated that it reversed the sales of the IOs and recorded the transaction as a secured borrowing.
It also stated that &#147;gains on sales of trading securities&#148; accounted for at the time of the sales
of the IOs were reversed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Transactions with R&#038;G Financial Corporation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>R&#038;G Announcements. </I></B>In April&nbsp;2005, R&#038;G Financial Corporation (&#147;R&#038;G&#148;) announced that its
previously filed financial statements for periods from January&nbsp;1, 2003 through December&nbsp;31, 2004
needed to be restated and should no longer be relied upon because of issues relating to the
methodology used in valuing its portfolio of residual interests retained in certain mortgage loan
transfers. In July&nbsp;2005, R&#038;G further announced that its previously filed financial statements for
period from January&nbsp;1, 2002 through December&nbsp;31, 2002 needed to be restated and should no longer be
relied upon. On November&nbsp;2, 2007, R&#038;G filed a Form 10-K/A (Amendment No.&nbsp;1) for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 (the &#147;Amended R&#038;G 2004 10-K&#148;). In the Amended R&#038;G 2004 10-K, R&#038;G stated that it
was reducing its retained earnings and capital reserves through December&nbsp;31, 2004 by $345&nbsp;million
on a pre-tax basis and that $237&nbsp;million of the $345&nbsp;million reduction was attributable to
recharacterization of certain mortgage loan transfers as secured borrowings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2008, R&#038;G announced that the SEC had approved a

purchase transactions had recourse provisions and other financial arrangements. In the Amended R&#038;G
2004 10-K, R&#038;G disclosed that it had determined, after a review of all of its transactions that it
had previously characterized as mortgage loan sales, to recharacterize certain of those
transactions as secured borrowings collateralized by real estate mortgage loans, including, as of
December&nbsp;31, 2004, $155&nbsp;million of transactions with Banco Popular. At December&nbsp;31, 2009, the remaining
balance of the mortgage loans purchased from R&#038;G recorded on our consolidated statement of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular, like other financial companies, faces a number of risks inherent to our business,
financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could cause

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and
uncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Weakness in the economy and in the real estate market in the geographic footprint of Popular has
adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact Popular.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the &#147;Island&#148;) and the Island&#146;s economy continues to deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2006, the Puerto Rico economy has been experiencing recessionary conditions. Based on
information published by the Puerto Rico Planning Board, the Puerto Rico real gross national
product decreased 3.7% during the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2009.
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government is currently addressing a fiscal deficit which has
been estimated at approximately $3.2&nbsp;billion or over 30% of its annual budget. It is implementing a
multi-year budget plan for reducing the deficit, as its access to the municipal bond market and its
credit ratings depend, in part, on achieving a balanced budget. Some of the measures implemented by
the government include reducing expenses, including public-sector employment through employee
layoffs. Since the government is an
important source of employment on the Island, these measures could have the effect of intensifying
the current recessionary cycle. The Puerto Rico Labor Department reported an unemployment rate of
14.3% for December&nbsp;2009, compared with an unemployment rate of 13.1% for December&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decline in the Island&#146;s economy has resulted in, among other things, a downturn in our
loan originations; an increase in the level of our non-performing assets, loan loss provisions and
charge-offs, particularly in our construction and commercial loan portfolios; an increase in the
rate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans; and a reduction in the value of our loans and loan
servicing portfolio, all of which have adversely affected our profitability. If the decline in
economic activity continues, there could be further adverse effects on our profitability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy of Puerto Rico is very sensitive to the price of oil in the global market. The
Island does not have significant mass transit available to the public and most of its electricity
is powered by oil, making it highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. A substantial increase
in its price could impact adversely the economy of Puerto Rico by reducing disposable income and
increasing the operating costs of most businesses and government. Consumer spending is particularly
sensitive to wide fluctuations in oil prices.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of real estate prices in Puerto Rico had been more stable than in other U.S.
markets, but the current economic environment has accelerated the devaluation of properties and has
increased portfolio delinquency when compared with previous periods. Additional economic weakness
in Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland could further pressure residential property values, loan
delinquencies,
foreclosures and the cost of repossessing and disposing of real estate collateral. The housing
market has suffered a substantial slowdown in sales activity in recent quarters, as reflected in
the low absorption rates of projects financed in our construction loan portfolio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current state of the economy and uncertainty in the private and public sectors has had an
adverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios. The persistent economic slowdown is
expected to cause those adverse effects to continue, as delinquency rates may increase in the
short-term, until sustainable growth resumes. Also, a potential reduction in consumer spending may
also impact growth in our other interest and non-interest revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
in 2010, the Puerto Rico economy should benefit from the disbursement
of approximately $2.5&nbsp;billion from the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (&#147;ARRA&#148;) and $280.3&nbsp;million
from the Commonwealth's local stimulus package.

operations and financial condition.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market instability and lack of investor confidence have led many lenders and institutional
investors to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers, including other financial
institutions. This has led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of
consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity in
general. The resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial markets
have adversely affected our industry and our business, results of operations and financial
condition. We do not expect a material improvement in the financial environment in the near future.
A worsening of these difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing us and
others in the financial industry. In particular, we face the following risks in connection with
these events:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in
government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the
financial services industry. The U.S. Government has intervened on an unprecedented scale,
responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. Several funding and
capital programs by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury were launched in 2008 and 2009,
with the objective of enhancing financial institutions&#146; ability to raise liquidity. It is expected
that these programs may have the effect of increasing the degree or nature of regulatory
supervision to which we are subjected. Furthermore, recent economic and market events have led to
numerous proposals for legislative and regulatory reform that could substantially intensify the
regulation of the financial services industry and that may significantly impact us. The proposals

number of other wide-ranging and comprehensive proposals for altering the structure, regulation and
competitive relationships of financial institutions. For example, separate comprehensive financial
reform plans could, if enacted, further substantially increase regulation of the financial services
industry and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry
to conduct business consistent with historical practices. Federal and state regulatory agencies
also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing
regulations are applied. Bills were introduced in both houses of Congress in the second half of
2009, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed a financial reform bill in December of 2009, but
similar action has not been taken by the U.S. Senate. We cannot predict the substance final form,
or impact effects on Popular, of these pending or future legislation, regulation or
the application thereof. These and other potential regulation and scrutiny mayor proposed
legislative and regulatory changes could significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of
our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and, limit our
ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner or otherwise adversely affect our
results of operations or earnings.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;9, 2009, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law the Special Act Declaring a
State of Fiscal Emergency and Establishing an Integral Plan of Fiscal Stabilization to Save Puerto
Rico&#146;s Credit, Act No.&nbsp;7. The Act imposes a series of temporary and permanent measures, including
the imposition of a 0.591% special tax applicable to properties used for residential (excluding
those exempt as detailed in the Act) and commercial purposes, and payable to the Puerto Rico
Treasury Department. This temporary measure is effective for tax years that commenced after June
30, 2009 and before July&nbsp;1, 2012. The imposition of this special property tax could adversely
affect the disposable income of borrowers from the commercial, consumer and mortgage loan
portfolios and may cause an increase in our delinquency and foreclosure rates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Financial results are constantly exposed to market risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the market
value of assets and liabilities due to interest rate volatility. Despite the varied nature of
market risks, the primary source of this risk to us is the impact of changes in interest rates on
net interest income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated on earning assets and the
interest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics of
the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could either
increase or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structure
of the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature
or reprice in that period. Any mismatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
is known as a gap position. A positive gap denotes asset sensitivity, which means that an increase
in interest rates could have a positive effect on net interest income, while a decrease in interest
rates could have a negative effect on net interest income. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had a
positive gap position.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board lowered the federal funds target rate from 4.25% at the beginning of
2008 to between 0% and 0.25% at December&nbsp;31, 2008. This was one of various measures implemented by
the Federal Reserve Board to improve the flow of credit throughout the financial system. Given that
the level of short-term rates is close to zero, a concern in the markets has been when may
monetary policy be tightened again and the possible impact on the financial markets. The
future outlook on interest rates and their impact on Popular&#146;s interest income, interest expense
and net interest income is uncertain. The federal funds target rate stayed between 0% to 0.25%
throughout 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We usually run our net interest income simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the
yield curve is assumed to rise and decline gradually by the same amount, usually 200 basis points.
Given the fact that as of year-end 2009, some short-term rates were close to zero and some term
interest rates were below 2.0%, management has decided to focus measuring the risk of net interest
income in rising rate scenarios. The rising rate scenarios used in
our market risk disclosure reflect gradual parallel changes of
200 and 400 basis points during the twelve-month period ending December&nbsp;31, 2010. Projected net
interest income under the 200 basis points rising rate scenario
increases by $59.8&nbsp;million
while the 400 basis points simulation increases by $103.2&nbsp;million. These scenarios were compared
against our flat interest rates forecast.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market disruptions has led us to reduce substantially the use
of unsecured short-term borrowings. They have been largely replaced with deposits and long-term
secured borrowings, and to a lesser extent, long-term unsecured debt. Therefore, the cost of the
liabilities of Popular does not respond as quickly to changes in the levels of interest rates. Our
Asset Liability Management Committee (&#147;ALCO&#148;) committee regularly reviews our interest rate risk
and initiates any action necessary to maintain our potential volatility within limits.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The hedging transactions that we enter into may not be effective in managing the exposure to market
risk, including interest rate risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use derivatives, to a limited extent, to manage part of the exposure to market risk caused
by changes in interest rates or basis risk. The derivative instruments that we may utilize also
have their own risks, which include: (1)&nbsp;basis risk, which is the risk of loss associated with
variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and/or hedge cost; (2)&nbsp;credit or
default risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a
particular transaction to perform its obligations there under; and (3)&nbsp;legal risk, which is the
risk that Popular is unable to enforce certain terms of such instruments. All or any of such risks
could expose Popular to losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher market volatility in the capital markets could impact the performance of our hedging
transactions. Most hedging activity is related to protecting the market value of mortgage loans
that are segregated for future sale and derivatives positions to hedge the cost of liabilities
issued or derivative positions with banking clients.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,
counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and
counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services
industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge
funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the
event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated
when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to
recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurance
that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or
earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. We
request collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitor these on
a regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by us
and results in losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when market
confidence is affected by events related to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion among
participants increases substantially and makes it more difficult to borrow in the credit markets.
Our credit ratings have been reduced substantially during the past year, and our senior unsecured
ratings are now &#147;non-investment grade&#148; with the three major rating agencies. This may make it more
difficult for Popular to borrow in the capital markets and at much higher cost.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Prolonged economic weakness, a continuing decline in the real estate market in the U.S. mainland,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying
periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and
industry-wide losses. &#147;Bust&#148; cycles in the housing sector affect our business by decreasing the
volume of loans originated and increasing the level of credit losses related to our mortgage loans.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing market in the U.S. is undergoing a correction of historic proportions. After a
period of several years of booming housing markets, fueled by liberal credit conditions and rapidly
rising property values, since early 2007 the sector has been in the midst of a
substantial dislocation. This dislocation has had a significant impact on some of our
U.S.-based business segments and has affected our ongoing financial results and condition. The
general level of property values in the U.S., as measured by several indices widely followed by the
market, has declined significantly. These declines are the result of ongoing market adjustments
that are aligning property values with income levels and home inventories. The supply of homes in
the market increased substantially, and property value decreases were required to clear the
overhang of excess inventory in the U.S. market. Recent indicators suggest that after a material
price correction, the U.S. real estate market may be entering a period of relative stability.
Nonetheless, further declines in property values could impact the credit quality of our U.S.
mortgage loan portfolio because the value of the homes underlying the loans is a primary source of
repayment in the event of foreclosure. In the event of foreclosure in a loan from this portfolio,
the current market value of the underlying collateral could be insufficient to cover the loan
amount owed.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses harms our ability to
sell loans, the prices it receives for loans sold, and the values of our mortgage loans
held-for-sale. In addition, any material decline in real estate values would weaken Popular&#146;s
collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. In
such event, we will be subject to the risk of loss on such mortgage assets arising from borrower
defaults.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain exposure in our U.S. loan portfolio to the housing sector. As of December&nbsp;31,
2009, we had $4.6&nbsp;billion in residential mortgage loans in portfolio, of which $1.5&nbsp;billion was
located in the continental U.S. Further housing value declines in the U.S. would impact the level
of losses in this portfolio. Also, we have exposure to individuals in the form of home equity
loans, home equity lines of credit or &#147;HELOCs&#148;, and second mortgages, which because of declining
home values have become in effect unsecured consumer loans. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, these U.S.
portfolios amounted to $870&nbsp;million. These portfolios are sensitive to the economic cycle in the
U.S., and a further deterioration of the economy and employment conditions in the mainland would
affect the level of losses from this exposure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Popular operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in
federal and local laws and regulations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and Puerto
Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal or Puerto Rico laws or regulations could
have a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or
adopted in the future that could significantly affect Popular&#146;s powers, authority and operations,
which could have a material adverse effect on Popular&#146;s financial condition and results of
operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties,
have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices or
violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion
and power may have a negative impact on Popular.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits. The
competition in originating loans comes principally from other U.S., Puerto Rico and foreign banks,
mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and other institutional
lenders and purchasers of loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Puerto Rico, competition is primarily from other local depository institutions and from
the local operations of several global foreign and domestic banks. As a group they compete in all
segments of the market and present a formidable source of competition for Popular. Competition is
particularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is very aggressive.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.S., competition is primarily from community banks operating in our footprint together
with the national banking institutions. These include institutions with much more resources than we
have and can exert substantial competitive pressure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased competition could require that we increase the rates offered on deposits or lower
the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking market in Puerto Rico experienced some consolidations on the past two decades, as
a result of bank failures and voluntary intramarket transactions. Even though some institutions are
no longer in existence as a result of the consolidation process, there remain six publicly-traded
local banking institutions, as well as a non-public local banking
institution, three foreign global banks and a major domestic institution
competing in the Puerto Rico market. Some industry experts have commented that further
consolidation in the Puerto Rico banking industry may be necessary or imminent. Although management
may decide that our involvement in the consolidation of the Puerto Rico banking industry may be in
our best interest, there can be no assurances that we could successfully complete a transaction, or
if we did, that we could successfully integrate the operations of another banking institution into
our own operations without incurring substantial disruptions to our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may have opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in
FDIC-assisted transactions. Although these transactions typically provide for FDIC assistance to an
acquirer to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing
indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution, we would still be subject to
many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in negotiated transactions,
including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the
anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect. In addition,
because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time and access
to information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated acquisition, we
may face additional risk in FDIC-assisted transactions. These risks include additional strain on management
resources, management of problem loans, problems related to integration of personnel and operating
systems and impact to our capital resources requiring us to raise additional capital. We cannot

deemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in
accordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to our
financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the
future, including forecasts of economic and market conditions that might impair the ability of our
borrowers to repay the loans. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated
the level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to increase the provision for loan
losses in the future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons
beyond our control. Any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any loan losses in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a significant portfolio in construction and commercial loans, mostly secured by
commercial and residential real estate properties. Due to their nature, these loans entail a higher
credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, may have
less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more
sensitive to economic downturns. Rapidly changing collateral values, general economic conditions
and numerous other factors continue to create volatility in the housing markets and have increased
the possibility that additional losses may have to be recognized with respect to our current
non-performing assets. Furthermore, given the current slowdown in the real estate market, the
properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties, and
inaccurate or incomplete information could negatively impact our financial condition and results of
operations.</B></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and
counterparties, we may rely on information provided to us by customers and counterparties,
including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations
of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with
respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding
whether to extend credit to a business, we may assume that the customer&#146;s audited financial
statements conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) and present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer.
We may also rely on the audit report covering those financial statements. Popular&#146;s financial
conditions and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on
financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Rating downgrades on the Government of Puerto Rico&#146;s debt obligations could affect the value of our
loans to the Government and our portfolio of Puerto Rico Government securities.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Puerto Rico&#146;s economy is closely integrated to that of the U.S. mainland and its
government and many of its instrumentalities are investment grade-rated borrowers in the U.S.
capital markets, the fiscal situation of the Government of Puerto Rico has led nationally
recognized rating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Central Government&#146;s fiscal challenges in 2006,
Moody&#146;s and S&#038;P then downgraded the rating of its obligations,
maintaining them within investment-grade levels. Since then, actions by the Government have
improved the credit outlook. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, S&#038;P rated the Government&#146;s general
obligations at BBB-, while Moodys rated them at Baa3- both in the lowest notch of investment grade.
In November&nbsp;2007, Moody&#146;s upgraded the outlook of the Commonwealth&#146;s credit ratings to &#147;stable&#148;
from &#147;negative&#148;, recognizing the progress that the Commonwealth has made in addressing the fiscal
challenges it had faced in recent years. The Commonwealth is currently implementing a multi-year
budget plan to address the deficit.

grade &#151; other factors could trigger an outlook change, such as the inability to successfully
complete the
implementation of the multiyear fiscal plan to bring the Central Government&#146;s budget back into
balance, pursuant to Act No.&nbsp;7 of the Commonwealth of P.R.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors such as the government&#146;s ability to implement meaningful steps to control operating
expenditures and maintain the integrity of the tax base will be key determinants of future ratings
stability. Also, the inability to agree on future fiscal year Commonwealth budgets could result in
ratings pressure from the rating agencies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgrade
in Puerto Rico&#146;s debt obligations. However, deterioration in the fiscal situation with possible
negative ratings implications, could adversely affect the value of Puerto Rico&#146;s Government
obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had $1.1&nbsp;billion of credit facilities granted to or guaranteed by the
Puerto Rico Government and its political subdivisions, of which $215&nbsp;million were uncommitted lines
of credit. Of these total credit facilities granted, $994&nbsp;million were outstanding at
December&nbsp;31, 2009. A substantial portion of our credit exposure to the Government of Puerto Rico is
either collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues
identified for its repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans to
public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as water
and electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from the
Central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from it. We also have loans to
various municipalities for which the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the
applicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment. These municipalities are required by
law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all of
its general obligation bonds and loans. Another portion of these loans consists of special
obligations of various municipalities that are payable from the basic real and personal property
taxes collected within such municipalities. The good faith and credit obligations of the
municipalities have a first lien on the basic property taxes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had outstanding $263&nbsp;million in Obligations of Puerto
Rico, States and Political Subdivisions as part of our investment portfolio. Of that total, $258
million was exposed to the creditworthiness of the Puerto Rico Government and its municipalities.
Of that portfolio, $55&nbsp;million are in the form of Puerto Rico
Commonwealth Appropriation Bonds, of which $45&nbsp;million are rated Ba1, one notch below investment grade, by Moody&#146;s, while S&#038;P rates them as investment grade. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, the Puerto Rico
Commonwealth Appropriation Bonds represented approximately $0.6&nbsp;million in unrealized losses in the
investment securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios. We continue to closely
monitor the political and economic situation of the Island and evaluates the portfolio for any
declines in value that management may consider being other-than-temporary.

arrangements.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until
the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. In the past, we have
retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we
also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. Consequently, we may suffer losses on
these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted
mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the
loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding
and disposing of the related property.

are originated in accordance with the secondary market&#146;s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or
certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize repurchases
and losses from defective
loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. We have
established specific reserves for possible losses related to repurchases resulting from
representation and warranty violations on specific portfolios. Nonetheless, we do not expect any
such losses to be significant, although if they were to occur, they could adversely impact our

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular earns revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the loans and other products and
services we sell. As the economy worsens and consumer and business spending decreases and
unemployment rises, the demand for those products and services can fall, reducing our interest and
fee income and our earnings. These same conditions can also hurt the ability of our borrowers to
repay their loans, causing us to incur higher credit losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008 and continuing in 2009, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased
resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the DIF. In addition, the FDIC
instituted two temporary programs, to further insure customer deposits at FDIC-member banks:
deposit accounts are now insured up to $250,000 per customer (up from $100,000) and
non-interest-bearing transaction accounts are fully insured (unlimited coverage) as a result of our
participation in the TAGP. These programs have placed additional stress on the Deposit Insurance
Fund.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the
DIF, the FDIC increased assessment rates of insured institutions uniformly by 7 cents
for every $100 of deposits beginning with the first quarter of 2009, with additional changes in
April&nbsp;1, 2009, which required riskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring
in rate adjustments based on, among other things, secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels. In
May&nbsp;2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule, effective June&nbsp;30, 2009, that imposed a special assessment
of 5 cents for every $100 on each insured depository institution&#146;s assets minus its Tier 1 Capital
as of June&nbsp;30, 2009, subject to a cap equal to 10 cents per $100 of assessable deposits for the
second quarter 2009 risk-based capital assessment. This special assessment applied to us and
resulted in a $16.7&nbsp;million expense in our second quarter of 2009. On November&nbsp;12, 2009, the FDIC
adopted a rule requiring banks to prepay three years&#146; worth of premiums to replenish its depleted
insurance fund. In December&nbsp;30, 2009, Popular prepaid $221&nbsp;million and reduced our year-end
liquidity at our banking subsidiaries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC
insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or our capital position
is further impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently
increased levels. Our expenses for 2009 were significantly and adversely affected by these
increased premiums. These announced increases and any future increases or special assessments
may materially adversely affect our results of
operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we are audited by various federal, state and local authorities regarding
income tax matters. Significant judgment is required to determine Popular&#146;s provision for income
taxes and our liabilities for federal, state, local and other taxes. Popular&#146;s audits are in
various stages of completion; however, no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with
certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit, appeal and, in some cases, litigation process.
Although we believe our approach to determine the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in
accordance with ASC Topic 740 &#147; Income taxes&#148;, it is possible that the final tax authority may take
a tax position that is materially different than that which is reflected in Popular&#146;s income tax
provision and other tax reserves. As each audit is conducted, adjustments, if any, are
appropriately recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period determined. Such
differences could have a material adverse effect on Popular&#146;s income tax provision or benefit, or
other tax reserves, in the reporting period in which such determination is made and, consequently,
on the results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows for such period.

December&nbsp;31, 2009. The results of the assessment at December&nbsp;31, 2009 indicated that the implied
fair value of goodwill exceeded the goodwill carrying amount, resulting in no goodwill impairment.
The results obtained in the December&nbsp;31, 2009 assessment were consistent with the results of the
annual impairment test performed in the third quarter of&nbsp;2009. It is possible that the assumptions and conclusions
regarding the valuation of our reporting units could change adversely and could result in the
recognition of goodwill impairment. Such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our
future results of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2009, we had approximately $604&nbsp;million of
goodwill remaining on our balance sheet, of which $402&nbsp;million was related to BPNA. Declines in our

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and
compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by
employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting
from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result
from Popular&#146;s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices,
corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community
organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our
ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely
and accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems
have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures
exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices
are followed. While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data
processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that
future losses will not occur.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable
financial reports and prevent fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation
that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Management continually seeks to improve
these controls and procedures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management believes that our key internal controls over financial reporting are currently
effective; however, such controls and procedures will be modified, supplemented, and changed from
time to time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments.
While Management will continue to assess our controls and procedures and take immediate action to
remediate any future perceived gaps, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of these
controls and procedures on an on-going basis. Any failure to maintain in the future an effective
internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property,
legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks. Not all such risks are insured, in
any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we
face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may
default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the former risk
by conducting due diligence reviews on the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than
one insurer when feasible and practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or
bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default
insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could
adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an
immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on
our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. If many
default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a
financial impact would be amplified and the disruption to the default insurance industry could
curtail our ability to originate new loans that need such insurance, which would result in a loss
of business for us.

physical assets. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or
liability to us. In addition, there is the risk that our controls and procedures as well as
business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affect
our operations and could materially adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to
expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing us to litigation,
regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management of risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly
and verify a large number of transactions and events. We have devoted resources to develop our risk
management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our
policies and procedures may not be comprehensive enough given current market conditions. Some of
our methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market
behavior or statistically based on historical models. As a result, these methods may not fully
predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than our historical measures
indicate. Other risk management methods depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets,
clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This information
may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and
competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. The executive
compensation provisions of the EESA, including amendments to such provisions implemented under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, are expected to limit the types of compensation
arrangements that Popular may enter into with our most senior leaders upon adoption of implementing
standards by the U. S. Treasury. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve
Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our
competitors. Limitations on our
compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented
leaders in support of our long term strategy.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. In October
2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies
that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, including
Popular and our banking subsidiaries. The proposal sets forth three key principles for incentive
compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not
encourage excessive risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking
organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation
arrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s
ability to effectively identify and manage risks, be compatible with effective internal controls
and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. The proposal also
contemplates a detailed review by the Federal Reserve Board of the incentive compensation policies and
practices of a number of &#147;large, complex banking organizations.&#148; Any deficiencies in compensation
practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory ratings,
which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The proposal provides
that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation
arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the
organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators&#146; policies on executive compensation are
continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be
determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of
Popular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate our and their key employees.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Adverse credit market conditions may continue to affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs.
We may need additional capital resources in the future and these capital resources may not be
available when needed or at all.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credit markets, although recovering, continue to experience extreme volatility and
disruption. General credit market conditions remain challenging for most issuers, particularly for
non-investment grade issuers like us. We need liquidity to, among other things, pay our operating
expenses, interest on our debt, maintain our lending activities and repay or replace our maturing
liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we may be forced to curtail our operations. The
availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions,
the general availability of credit and our creditworthiness. Our cash flows and financial condition
could be materially affected by continued disruptions in the financial markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may need to raise additional debt or equity financing in the future to maintain adequate
liquidity and capital resources or to finance future growth, investments or strategic acquisitions.
We cannot assure you, that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are
unable to obtain additional financing, we may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity and
capital resources or to grow, make strategic acquisitions or investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Our funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support future growth.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our banking subsidiaries rely on customer deposits, brokered deposits and repurchase
agreements to fund their operations. In addition, Popular&#146;s banking subsidiaries maintain borrowing
facilities with the Federal Home Loan Banks (&#147;FHLB&#148;) and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, and have a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to quickly raise
funds under these facilities. Borrowings from the FHLB or the Fed discount window require Popular
to pledge securities or whole loans as collateral. Although those banking subsidiaries have
historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, no assurance can be
given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if our financial condition or
general market conditions were to change. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if
our banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not
available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. Finally, if we are required to
rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, revenues may not
increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, profitability would be adversely affected.
However, management believes that these risks are mitigated by our banking subsidiaries&#146; status as
FDIC-insured depository institutions.
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we consider such sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs, we may seek
additional debt financing in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. There can be
no assurance additional borrowings, if sought, would be available to us or, on what terms. If
additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, our growth
and future prospects could be adversely affected.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
mentioned above, under the section &#147;FDIC Insurance&#148;, the FDIC extended its TAGP through June&nbsp;30, 2010. This program provides
depositors with unlimited coverage for non-interest-bearing transaction accounts at participating
FDIC-insured institutions. The FDIC&#146;s failure to extend its
TAGP beyond June 2010, may result in a reduction of non-interest-bearing deposits
at our insured banking subsidiaries. The standard insurance amount of
$250,000 per depositor remains in effect through December 31, 2013.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>As a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity.</B>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other
operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include capitalizing
subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking
subsidiaries, Banco Popular and BPNA, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and
other distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. A failure by our banking
subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative
impact on our results of operation and financial position. Also, a failure by the bank holding
company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary
course of business, may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete

of our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements in
the future and may have other adverse effects on our business.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions by the rating agencies have raised the cost of our borrowings. Borrowings amounting to
$350&nbsp;million have &#147;ratings triggers&#148; that call for an increase in their interest rate in the event
of a ratings downgrade. For example, as a result of rating downgrades effected by the major rating
agencies in January, April, June and December&nbsp;2009, the cost of servicing $350&nbsp;million of our
senior debt increased by an additional 500 basis points.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular&#146;s senior debt and preferred stock ratings are currently rated &#147;non-investment&#148; grade
by the three major rating agencies. The market for non-investment grade securities is much smaller
and less liquid than for investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue
preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be
sufficient demand to complete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for
more highly rated securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect our
relationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our
hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit
counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based
on our below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral
requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute
counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital
levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. In addition,
servicing, licensing and custodial agreements that we are party to with third parties, include ratings covenants. Servicing rights represent a
contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the
underlying mortgage loans. Failure to maintain the required credit
ratings, the third parties could have the right to require Popular to
engage a substitute fund custodian and/or increase collateral levels
securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential
mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain
contractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure such
recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not
maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations
approximated $54 million at December 31, 2009. We could be required
to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet
additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The
requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss
of custodian funds could reduce Popular's liquidity resources and
impact its operating results. The termination of those
agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverse
effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings
downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions
with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below
investment grade.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular
and our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets,
liabilities and certain off balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators
regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital
guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be
materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain well-capitalized status under the
regulatory framework, or are deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if we
experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company and our related
eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and our ability to offer
certain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

equity capital in the future to satisfy liquidity and regulatory needs.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of ongoing challenging recessionary conditions, credit losses have depleted our
tangible common equity. Given the focus on tangible common equity by regulatory authorities, rating
agencies and the market, we may be required to raise additional capital through the issuance of
additional common stock in future periods to replace that common
equity. We issued over 357&nbsp;million shares of common stock in the exchange offer that was conducted in the third quarter of
2009, which left us with only a limited number of authorized and unreserved shares of common stock
to issue in the future. As a result, we will need to obtain stockholder consent to amend our
certificate of incorporation to increase the amount of authorized capital stock if we intend to
issue significant amounts of common stock in the future. We cannot be assured that our stockholders
will approve such an increase.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are
divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders,
one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and the
other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control of
the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held
before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of
incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed by
the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds of the combined voting power of
the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have
the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of
Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage
attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involved
and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a
potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a
stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and
penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain
high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material
adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could
seriously harm our business prospects. As more fully described in Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Legal Proceedings&#148;, five

for the District of Puerto Rico and another derivative suit was filed in the Puerto Rico Court of

against Popular, certain of our directors and officers and others. Although at this early
stage, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse outcome, or

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Additional assistance from the U.S. Government may further dilute existing holders of our common
stock.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be new regulatory requirements or standards, or additional U.S. Government programs
or requirements or we could incur losses in the future that could result in, or require, additional
equity issuances. Such further equity issuances would further dilute the existing holders of our
common stock perhaps significantly.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential issuance of additional shares of our common stock or common equivalent
securities in future equity offerings, or as a result of the exercise of the warrant the U.S.
Treasury holds, would dilute the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders and could
also involve U.S. Government constraints on our operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Dividends on our common stock and preferred stock have been suspended and stockholders may not
receive funds in connection with their investment in our common stock or preferred stock without
selling their shares.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders of our common stock and preferred stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as
our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. During 2009,
we suspended dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock. Furthermore, unless we have
redeemed all of the trust preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury or the U.S. Treasury has
transferred all of its trust preferred securities to third parties, the consent of the U.S.
Treasury will be required for us to, among other things, increase the dividend rate per share of
common stock above $0.08 per share or to repurchase or redeem equity securities, including our
common stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. Popular has also granted registration rights
and offering facilitation rights to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to which we have agreed to lock-up
periods during which it would be unable to issue equity securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Also, we are a bank holding
company and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory
considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and
dividends. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that
the bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current
operating earnings. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has
indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has
discouraged dividend pay-out ratios that are at the 100% or higher level unless both asset quality
and capital are very strong.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by each
trust that has issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends
or distributions on our capital stock, including our common stock and preferred stock. The terms also prohibit us from purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of
our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a
deferral period is continuing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your shares of our common stock or preferred
stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment. You may not realize a gain on your
investment when you sell the common stock or preferred stock and may lose the entire amount of your
investment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Offerings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock in the event of liquidation, and/or
preferred equity securities, which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend
distributions or in the event of liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common
stock.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may seek to increase our liquidity and/or capital resources by offering debt or preferred
equity securities, including medium-term notes, trust preferred securities, senior or subordinated
notes and preferred stock. In the event of liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares
of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings may receive distributions of our
available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute
the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock
from time to time without any action on the part of the stockholders. Our Board of Directors also
has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of
preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over
our common stock with respect to dividends or upon our dissolution, winding up and liquidation and
other terms. If we issue preferred shares in the future that has a preference over our common stock
with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, or if we issue preferred shares with
voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of our common
stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular
and our subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business. Based on the opinion of legal counsel, management believes that the
final disposition of these matters, except for the matters described below which are in very early
stages and management cannot currently predict their outcome, will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between May&nbsp;14, 2009 and March&nbsp;1, 2010<B>, </B>five putative class actions and two derivative claims
were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rico
Court of First Instance, San Juan Part, against Popular, Inc. and
certain of our directors and
officers, among others. The five class actions have now been consolidated into two separate
actions: a securities class action captioned <I>Hoff v. Popular, Inc., et al. </I>(consolidated with <I>Otero
v. Popular, Inc., et al</I>.) and an ERISA class action entitled
<I>In re Popular, Inc. ERISA Litigation</I>
(comprised of the consolidated cases of <I>Walsh v. Popular, Inc. et al</I>.; <I>Monta&#241;ez v. Popular, Inc.,
et al</I>.; and <I>Dougan v. Popular, Inc., et al</I>.). On October&nbsp;19, 2009, plaintiffs in the <I>Hoff </I>case
filed a consolidated class action complaint which includes as defendants the underwriters in the May
2008 offering of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock. The consolidated action purports to be on behalf of
purchasers of Popular&#146;s securities between January&nbsp;24, 2008 and February&nbsp;19, 2009 and alleges that the
defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and
Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by issuing a series of allegedly false and/or misleading
statements and/or omitting to disclose material facts necessary to make statements made by us not
false and misleading. The consolidated action also alleges that the defendants violated Section&nbsp;11,
Section&nbsp;12(a)(2) and Section&nbsp;15 of the Securities Act by making allegedly untrue statements and/or
omitting to disclose material facts necessary to make statements made by us not false and
misleading in connection with the May&nbsp;2008 offering of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock. The consolidated
securities class action complaint seeks class certification, an award of compensatory damages and
reasonable costs and expenses, including counsel fees. On January&nbsp;11, 2010, Popular and the
individual defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action complaint. On
November&nbsp;30, 2009, plaintiffs in the ERISA case filed a
consolidated class action complaint. The consolidated
complaint purports to be on behalf of employees participating in the Popular, Inc. U.S.A. 401(k)
Savings and Investment Plan and the Popular, Inc. Puerto Rico Savings and Investment Plan from
January&nbsp;24, 2008 to the date of the Complaint to recover losses pursuant to Sections&nbsp;409
and 502(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)&nbsp;against Popular,
certain directors, officers and members of plan committees, each of whom is alleged to be a plan
fiduciary. The consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants breached their alleged fiduciary obligations
by, among other things, failing to eliminate Popular stock as an investment alternative in the
plans. The complaint seeks to recover alleged losses to the plans and equitable relief, including
injunctive relief and a constructive trust, along with costs and attorneys fees. On December&nbsp;21,
2009, and in compliance with a scheduling order issued by the Court, Popular and the individual
defendants submitted an answer to the amended complaint. Shortly thereafter, on December&nbsp;31, 2009,
Popular and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated class action
complaint or, in the alternative, for judgment on the pleadings. The derivative actions (<I>Garcia v.
Carri&#243;n, et al</I>. and <I>Diaz v. Carri&#243;n, et al</I>.) have been brought purportedly for the benefit of
nominal defendant Popular, Inc. against certain executive officers and directors and allege
breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of assets and abuse of control in connection with our issuance of
allegedly false and misleading financial statements and financial reports and the offering of the
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock. The derivative complaints seek a judgment that the action is a proper
derivative action, an award of damages and restitution, and costs and disbursements, including
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, costs and expenses. On October&nbsp;9, 2009, the Court coordinated for purposes of discovery
the <I>Garcia </I>action and the consolidated securities class action. On October
15, 2009, Popular and the individual defendants moved to dismiss the <I>Garcia </I>complaint for failure
to make a demand on the Board of Directors prior to initiating litigation. On November&nbsp;20, 2009,
and pursuant to a stipulation among the parties, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and on
December&nbsp;21, 2009, Popular and the individual defendants moved to dismiss the <I>Garc&#237;a </I>amended
complaint. The <I>Diaz </I>case, filed in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, San Juan, has been removed to the U.S. District Court for the
District of Puerto Rico. On October&nbsp;13, 2009, Popular and the individual defendants moved to
consolidate the <I>Garcia </I>and <I>Diaz </I>actions. On October&nbsp;26, 2009, plaintiff moved to remand the <I>Diaz</I>
case to the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance and to stay defendants&#146; consolidation motion
pending the outcome of the remand proceedings. At a scheduling conference held on January&nbsp;14,
2010, the Court stayed discovery in both the <I>Hoff </I>and <I>Garc&#237;a </I>matters pending resolution of their respective
motions to dismiss.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this early stage, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse
outcome, or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss. It is possible that the ultimate
resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to our results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular&#146;s common stock is traded on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation System (&#147;NASDAQ&#148;) National Market System under the symbol &#147;BPOP&#148;. Information concerning
the range of high and low sales prices for our common shares for each quarterly period during 2009
and the previous four years, as well as cash dividends declared is contained under Table J, &#147;Common
Stock Performance&#148;, on page 45 in the MD&#038;A in the Annual Report, and is incorporated herein by
reference.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of February&nbsp;26, 2010, Popular had 10,562 stockholders of record
of our common stock, not
including beneficial owners whose shares are held in record names of brokers or other nominees. The
last sales price for our common stock on such date, as quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System
was $1.93 per share.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
June&nbsp;2009, Popular commenced an offer to issue shares of our common stock in exchange for
our Series&nbsp;A preferred stock and Series&nbsp;B preferred stock and for trust preferred securities (also
referred as capital securities). On August&nbsp;25, 2009, we completed the settlement of the exchange
offer and issued 357,510,076 new shares of common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange by holders of shares of the Series&nbsp;A and B non-cumulative preferred stock for
shares of common stock resulted in the extinguishment of such shares of preferred stock and an
issuance of 171,748,872 new shares of common stock. The Series&nbsp;A and B non-cumulative preferred
stock converted totaled 21,468,609 shares out of the 23,475,000 shares outstanding prior to the
exchange. The exchange of shares of preferred stock for shares of common stock resulted in a
decrease in accumulated deficit of $230.4&nbsp;million, which is also considered as part of
earnings applicable to common stockholders in the earnings (losses)&nbsp;per common share (&#147;EPS&#148;)
computations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, during the third quarter of 2009, Popular exchanged trust preferred securities issued by
different trusts for 185,761,204 new shares of common stock of Popular. The trust preferred
securities converted totaled 6,166,044 capital securities out of the 17,594,000 capital securities
outstanding prior to the exchange. The trust preferred securities were delivered to the trusts in
return for the junior subordinated debentures (recorded as notes payable in our financial
statements) that had been issued by Popular to the trusts in the past. The junior subordinated
debentures were submitted for cancellation by the indenture trustee under the applicable indenture.
We recognized a pre-tax gain of $80.3&nbsp;million on the extinguishment of the applicable junior
subordinated debentures that was included in the consolidated statement of operations for the third
quarter of 2009. This transaction was accounted as an early extinguishment of debt. The increase in
stockholders&#146; equity related to the exchange of trust preferred securities for shares of common
stock was approximately $390&nbsp;million, net of issuance costs, and including the aforementioned gain
on the early extinguishment of debt.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, on August&nbsp;21, 2009, Popular, Inc. and Popular Capital Trust III entered into an
exchange agreement with the U.S. Treasury pursuant to which the U.S. Treasury agreed with Popular
that the U.S. Treasury would exchange all 935,000 shares of Popular&#146;s outstanding Fixed Rate
Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series&nbsp;C, $1,000 liquidation preference per share (the
&#147;Series&nbsp;C Preferred Stock&#148;), owned by the U.S Treasury for 935,000 newly issued trust preferred
securities, $1,000 liquidation amount per capital security. The trust preferred securities were
issued to the U.S. Treasury on August&nbsp;24, 2009. In connection with this exchange, the trust used
the Series&nbsp;C preferred stock, together with the proceeds of the issuance and sale by the trust to
Popular of $1&nbsp;million aggregate liquidation amount of its fixed rate common securities, to purchase
$936&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of the junior subordinated debentures issued by Popular.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trust preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury have a distribution rate of 5%
until, but excluding December&nbsp;5, 2013 and 9% thereafter (which is the same as the dividend rate on
the previously outstanding Series&nbsp;C Preferred Stock). The common securities of the trust, in the
amount of $1&nbsp;million, are held by Popular.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sole asset and only source of funds to make payments on the trust preferred securities and
the common securities of the trust is $936&nbsp;million of Popular&#146;s Fixed Rate Perpetual Junior
Subordinated Debentures, Series&nbsp;A, issued by Popular to the trust. These debentures have an
interest rate of 5% until, but excluding December&nbsp;5, 2013 and 9% thereafter. The debentures are
perpetual and may be redeemed by Popular at any time, subject to the consent of the
Federal Reserve Board.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guarantee agreement dated as of August&nbsp;24, 2009, Popular irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to pay in full to the holders of the trust preferred securities the
guaranteed payments, as and when due. Under the guarantee agreement, Popular has guaranteed the
payment of the liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities upon liquidation of the trust,
but only to the extent that the trust has funds available to make such payments. Our obligation to
make the guaranteed payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts to the
holders of the trust preferred securities or by causing the issuer trust to pay such amounts to the
holders. The obligations of Popular under the guarantee agreement constitute unsecured obligations
and rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to all senior debt. The obligations of Popular
under the guarantee agreement rank <I>pari passu </I>with the obligations of Popular under any similar

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">guarantee agreements issued by us on behalf of the holders of preferred or capital securities
issued by any statutory trust, among others stated in the guarantee agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the exchange agreement, Popular agreed that, without the consent of the U.S. Treasury,
it would not increase our dividend rate per share of common stock above that in effect as of
October&nbsp;14, 2008, $0.08 per share, or repurchase shares of our common stock until, in each case,
the earlier of December&nbsp;5, 2011 or such time as all of the new trust preferred securities have been
redeemed or transferred by the U.S. Treasury.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrant to purchase 20,932,836 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $6.70
per share that was initially issued to the U.S Treasury in connection with the issuance of the
Series&nbsp;C preferred stock on December&nbsp;5, 2008 remains outstanding without amendment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trust preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury continue to qualify as Tier 1
regulatory capital. The trust preferred securities are subject to the 25% limitation on Tier 1
Capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular paid an exchange fee of $13&nbsp;million to the U.S. Treasury in connection with the
exchange of outstanding shares of Series&nbsp;C preferred stock for the new trust preferred securities.
This exchange fee will be amortized through interest expense using the interest yield method over
the estimated life of the junior subordinated debentures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the accounting treatment and further information about the exchange offer please refer to
Note 21, &#147;Exchange offers&#148; and Note 24 &#147;Net income (loss) per common share&#148; on our Audited Financial
Statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2009, Popular announced the suspension of dividends on our common stock and Series&nbsp;A
and B preferred stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dividends paid to holders of our preferred stock must be declared by our Board of
Directors. On a regular basis, the Board of Directors reviews various factors when considering the payment of
dividends on our outstanding preferred stock, including our capital levels, recent and projected
financial results and liquidity. The Board of Directors is not obligated to declare dividends and dividends do
not accumulate in the event they are not paid.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our common stock ranks junior to all series of preferred stock as to dividend rights and/or as
to rights on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Popular. All series of preferred stock are
pari passu. Dividends on each series of preferred stock are payable if declared. Our ability to
declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, our common stock is subject
to certain restrictions in the event that Popular fails to pay or set aside full dividends on the
preferred stock for the latest dividend period. The ability of Popular to pay dividends in the
future is limited by regulatory requirements, legal availability of funds, recent and projected
financial results, capital levels and liquidity, general business conditions and other
factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;19, 2009, the Board of Directors of Popular resolved to retire 13,597,261 shares
of our common stock that were held by Popular as treasury shares. It is our accounting policy to
account, at retirement, for the excess of the cost of the treasury stock over its par value
entirely to surplus.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional information concerning legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends
by Popular, Banco Popular and BPNA is contained under the caption &#147;Regulation and Supervision&#148; in
Item&nbsp;1 herein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular
offers a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan for our stockholders that
allows them to reinvest their dividends in shares of common stock at a 5% discount from the average
market price at the time of the issuance, as well as purchase shares of common stock directly from
Popular by making optional cash payments at prevailing market prices. No shares will be sold
directly by us to participants in the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan at less than
the par value of our common stock. Since during the first months of 2009 our common stock price
was below $6 per share (the par value of our common stock until May&nbsp;1, 2009) and in June&nbsp;2009
Popular suspended dividends on our common stock, no additional shares were issued under the
dividend reinvestment during 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For information about the securities authorized for issuance under our equity based plans,
refer to Part&nbsp;III, Item&nbsp;11.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2004, our shareholders adopted the Popular, Inc. 2004 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The
maximum number of shares of common stock issuable under this Plan is 10,000,000.

    <TD>On November&nbsp;3, 2008, Popular sold residual interests and
servicing related assets of PFH and Popular, FS to Goldman Sachs
Mortgage Company, Goldman, Sachs &#038; Co. and Litton Loan Servicing,
LP. In addition, on September&nbsp;18, 2008, Popular announced the
consummation of the sale of manufactured housing loans of PFH to
21st Mortgage Corp. and Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc. The
above transactions and past sales and restructuring plans
executed at PFH in the past two years have resulted in the
discontinuance of our PFH operations and PFH&#146;s results are
reflected as such in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The computation of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock
dividends excludes discontinued operations. Prior periods have
been retrospectively adjusted on a comparable basis.</TD>

    <TD>During 2008 and 2009, earnings were not sufficient to cover fixed
charges or preferred dividends and the ratios were less than 1:1.
Popular would have had to generate additional earnings of
approximately $235&nbsp;million and $625&nbsp;million to achieve ratios of
1:1 in 2008 and 2009, respectively.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of computing these consolidated ratios, earnings represent income before income
taxes, plus fixed charges. Fixed charges represent all interest
expense and capitalized (ratios are presented both
excluding and including interest on deposits), the portion of net rental expense, which is deemed
representative of the interest factor and the amortization of debt issuance expense. The interest
expense includes changes in the fair value of the non-hedging derivatives.
