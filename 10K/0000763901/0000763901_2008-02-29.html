the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include descriptions of
products or services, plans or objectives for future operations, and forecast of revenues,
earnings, cash flows, or other measures of economic performance. Forward-looking statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and, by their nature,
involve certain risks, uncertainties, estimates and assumptions by management that are difficult to
predict. Various factors, some of which are beyond the Corporation&#146;s control, could cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking
statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the rate of
growth in the economy, as well as general business and economic conditions; changes in interest
rates, as well as the magnitude of such changes; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal
government and its agencies; the relative strength or weakness of the consumer and commercial
credit sectors and of the real estate markets; the performance of the stock and bond markets;
competition in the financial services industry; possible legislative, tax or regulatory changes;
and difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to Popular, Inc. as of the
date of this report. Management assumes no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking
statements to reflect occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such
statements.

Proceedings,&#148; is inherently uncertain and depends on judicial interpretations of law and the
findings of regulators, judges and juries.

sheet, profitability and liquidity. Certain of these events occurred in 2007, while others are
expected to be effected in early 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>PFH Restructuring Plan</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2007, the Corporation adopted a Restructuring and Integration Plan at PFH, the
holding company of Equity One (the &#147;PFH Restructuring Plan&#148;). The PFH Restructuring Plan called for
PFH to exit the wholesale subprime mortgage loan origination business during early first quarter of
2007 and to shut-down the wholesale broker, retail and call center business divisions. Also, the
plan included consolidating PFH support functions with its sister U.S. banking entity, Banco
Popular North America, creating a single integrated North American financial services unit. At that
time, Popular decided to continue the operations of Equity One and its subsidiaries with over 130
consumer services branches, principally dedicated to direct subprime loan origination, consumer
finance and mortgage servicing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PFH Restructuring Plan resulted in restructuring costs amounting to approximately $14.7
million in 2007, primarily in severance and lease termination charges. In 2006, the Corporation
recognized $7.2&nbsp;million in impairment of long-lived assets and $14.2&nbsp;million in the impairment of
PFH&#146;s goodwill as a result of the PFH Restructuring Plan. Exiting these origination channels also
impacted financial results by reducing new loan volumes and, thus, had an impact on revenues
generated by the sale of loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>E-LOAN Restructuring Plan</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2007, the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted a restructuring plan for
its Internet financial services subsidiary E-LOAN (the &#147;E-LOAN Restructuring Plan&#148;). Considering
E-LOAN&#146;s operating losses in light of current market conditions and other factors, the Board of
Directors approved a substantial reduction of marketing and personnel costs at E-LOAN and changes
in E-LOAN&#146;s business model to align it with revenue expectations. The changes include concentrating
marketing investment toward the Internet and the origination of first mortgage loans that qualify
for sale to government sponsored entities (GSEs). Also, as a result of escalating credit costs in
the current economic environment and lower liquidity in the secondary markets for mortgage related
products, in December

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">2007, the Corporation determined to hold back the origination by E-LOAN of home equity lines
of credit, closed-end second lien mortgage loans and auto loans. The E-LOAN Restructuring Plan
continues to promote the Internet deposit gathering initiative with BPNA. As part of the E-LOAN
Restructuring Plan, the Corporation evaluated the value of E-LOAN&#146;s recorded goodwill and trademark
by considering the changes in E-LOAN&#146;s business model and the unprecedented conditions in the
mortgage loan business. The E-LOAN Restructuring Plan resulted in charges recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2007 as described in the table below (on a pre-tax basis).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cost-control plan initiative and changes in loan origination
strategies incorporated as part of the plan will result in the
elimination of over 400 positions between the fourth quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2008. As a result of the
E-LOAN Restructuring Plan, operating expenses are expected to be
reduced by approximately $77
million for 2008. E-LOAN&#146;s estimated net losses for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008 are expected
to decline by $15&nbsp;million, resulting principally from the reduction in operating expenses,
partially offset by the related tax impact and by lower volume of loan originations in certain
business channels that are impacted by this plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Recharacterization of Certain On-Balance Sheet Securitizations as Sales under FASB Statement No.&nbsp;140</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2001 through 2006, the Corporation conducted 21 mortgage loan securitizations that were
sales for legal purposes but did not qualify for sale accounting treatment at the time of inception
because the securitization trusts did not meet the criteria for qualifying special purpose entities
(&#147;QSPEs&#148;) contained in SFAS No.&nbsp;140 &#147;Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities&#148;. As a result, the transfers of the mortgage loans pursuant to these
securitizations were initially accounted for as secured borrowings with the mortgage loans
continuing to be reflected as assets on the Corporation&#146;s consolidated statement of financial
condition with appropriate footnote disclosure indicating that the mortgage loans were, for legal
purposes, sold to the securitization trusts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the Corporation&#146;s strategy of exiting the subprime business at PFH, on December&nbsp;19,
2007, PFH and the trustee for each of the related securitization trusts amended the provisions of
the related pooling and servicing agreements to delete the discretionary provisions that prevented
the transactions from qualifying for sale treatment. These changes in the primary discretionary

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation obtained a legal opinion, which among other considerations, indicated that
each amendment (a)&nbsp;is authorized or permitted under the pooling and servicing agreement related to
such amendment, and (b)&nbsp;will not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any
certificateholders covered by the related pooling and servicing agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the pooling and servicing agreement allowed the Corporation to recognize 16
out of the 21 transactions as sales under SFAS No.&nbsp;140. When accounting for the transfers as sales,
the Corporation (i)&nbsp;reclassified the loans as held-for-sale with the corresponding lower of cost or
market adjustment as of the date of the transfer, (ii)&nbsp;removed from the Corporation&#146;s books
approximately $3.2&nbsp;billion in mortgage loans and $3.1&nbsp;billion in related liabilities representing
secured borrowings, (iii)&nbsp;recognized assets referred to as residual interests, which represent the
fair value of residual interest certificates that were issued by the securitization trusts and
retained by PFH, and (iv)&nbsp;recognized mortgage servicing rights, which represent the fair value of
PFH&#146;s right to continue to service the mortgage loans transferred to the securitization trusts. As
part of the recharacterization, the Corporation recognized residual interests of $38&nbsp;million and
MSRs of $18&nbsp;million. The Corporation had previously recorded MSRs in several of these
securitization transactions, which amounted to $18&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2007. The net impact of
the recharacterization transaction was a pretax loss of $90.1&nbsp;million, which is included in the
caption &#147;(Loss) gain on sale of loans and valuation adjustments on loans held-for-sale&#148; in the
consolidated statement of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the loans in these trusts continued to be reflected as assets on the Corporation&#146;s
consolidated financial statements prior to affecting the loan
recharacterization transaction, the Corporation was required to record charge-offs and make provision
for inherent loan losses relating to such loans in accordance with FASB Statement No.&nbsp;5,
&#147;Accounting for Contingencies.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This loan recharacterization transaction as sale on the Corporation&#146;s financial statements
reflects management&#146;s current strategy of exiting the subprime mortgage origination business of
PFH. It also provides investors a better portrayal of the legal rights and obligations related to
these transactions and will allow them to better assess their economic impact on the Corporation&#146;s
financial condition. The removal of the mortgage assets from Popular&#146;s books had a favorable impact
on its capital ratios and reduced the amount of subprime mortgages in the Corporation&#146;s books. The
loan recharacterization transaction contributed with a reduction in non-performing mortgage loans
of approximately $316&nbsp;million, when compared to December&nbsp;31, 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strategic initiative resulted in the adoption of an additional restructuring plan at PFH
(the &#147;PFH Branch Network Restructuring Plan&#148;) during the
first quarter of 2008. It is anticipated that this restructuring plan (the
&#147;PFH Branch Network Restructuring Plan&#148;) will result in estimated combined charges for the
Corporation of approximately $19.5&nbsp;million, of which $1.9&nbsp;million in impairment charges related to
long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment, were recognized on
December&nbsp;31, 2007, and the remainder is expected to be substantially incurred in the first quarter
of 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;159 &#147;The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities&#148; (SFAS No.&nbsp;159)</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation adopted the provisions of SFAS No.&nbsp;159 in January&nbsp;2008. Management elected the
fair value option for approximately $287&nbsp;million of loans and $287&nbsp;million of bond certificates
associated to PFH&#146;s on-balance sheet securitizations that were outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2007
(transactions excluded from the above mentioned recharacterization transaction). These loans serve
as collateral for the bond certificates. Due to accounting constraints, the Corporation is unable
to recharacterize these loans securitizations as sales. Additionally, the Corporation elected the
fair value option for approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion of whole loans held-in-portfolio by PFH. These
whole loans consist principally of mortgage loans and second-liens that were originated through the
exited business of PFH and home equity lines of credit that had been originated by E-LOAN prior to
the 2007 U.S. reorganization. Due to their subprime characteristics and current market disruptions,
these loans are being held-in-portfolio as potential buyers have withdrawn from the market given
heightened concerns over credit quality of borrowers and continued deterioration in the housing
markets. Management understands that accounting for these loans at fair value provides a more
relevant and transparent measurement of the realizable value of the assets and differentiates the
PFH portfolio from that loan portfolio that the Corporation will continue to originate through
other channels outside PFH. The measurement of the bond certificates at fair value reflects the
actual exposure of the Corporation after considering the credit risk to be borne by the
certificateholders on the on-balance sheet securitization. Management understands that the adoption
of the fair value option for the financial assets and liabilities selected better reflects the
inherent risks of these instruments and reflects the intention of the Corporation to discontinue
most of the businesses previously conducted at PFH.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the adoption of SFAS No.&nbsp;159, the Corporation expects to recognize a negative
pre-tax adjustment that could range between $280&nbsp;million and $300&nbsp;million ($158&nbsp;million and $169
million after tax) due to the transitional adjustment for electing the fair value option on
existing instruments at adoption. That amount represents the difference between the fair value and
the carrying value of the loans at date of adoption. This negative adjustment would not impact
earnings but instead be reflected as a reduction of beginning retained earnings as of January&nbsp;1,
2008. Subsequent increases or decreases in the fair value of the assets and liabilities accounted
under SFAS No.&nbsp;159 provisions will be recorded as valuation adjustments through earnings in the
consolidated statement of operations. The fair value adjustments disclosed here are only estimates
as management is in the process of validating the methodologies used to value the assets and
liabilities and the results of such valuations. Also, management continues to evaluate the impact
that SFAS No.&nbsp;159 will have on the consolidated financial statements, including disclosures.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation, PIB and PNA are bank holding companies subject to supervision and regulation
by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. Under the BHC Act, prior to the adoption of the
Gramm Leach Bliley Act in 1999, the activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking
subsidiaries were limited to the business of banking and activities closely related to banking, and
no bank holding company could directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5%
of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company in the United
States, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In addition,
bank holding companies generally have been prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in
non-banking activities, unless they were found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related
to banking. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act authorized bank holding companies that qualify as &#147;financial
holding companies&#148; to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking activities, subject to
certain conditions. The Corporation has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under
the provisions of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. See &#147;The

case of BPNA, the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking Department and in the case
of Banco Popular, N.A., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#147;OCC&#148;) and the Commissioner

meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital tiers: &#147;well capitalized&#148;,
&#147;adequately capitalized&#148;, &#147;undercapitalized&#148;, &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;, and &#147;critically
undercapitalized&#148;. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies provide that a depository institution will be
deemed to be (1)&nbsp;well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and is
not subject to any written agreement or directive to meet a specific capital level; (2)&nbsp;adequately
capitalized, if it is not well capitalized, but maintains a leverage ratio of at least 4% (or at
least 3% if given the highest regulatory rating in its most recent report of examination and not
experiencing or anticipating significant growth), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4%
and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%; (3)&nbsp;undercapitalized if it fails to meet the
standards for adequately capitalized institutions (unless it is deemed significantly or critically
undercapitalized); (4)&nbsp;significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than 3%, a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than
6%; and (5)&nbsp;critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to 2% or less of total
assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2007, Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. were all well capitalized.

considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the Corporation&#146;s financial
condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well
capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The appropriate agency is
also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with
the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a
significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory
information other than the capital levels of the institution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking
agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe
or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution
(including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the
depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository
institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition,
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to
submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the
capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at
the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution
fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without
determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to
succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to
submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly
undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and
restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized,
requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or
conservator.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to FDIC-insured
depository institutions such as Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A., but they are not
directly applicable to holding companies such as the Corporation, PIB and PNA, which control such
institutions. However, the federal banking agencies have indicated that, in regulating holding
companies, they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment
of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions
pursuant to such provisions and regulations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to restrictions under federal law that
limit the transfer of funds by any of them to the Corporation, PIB, PNA, or any of the

credit, investments or asset purchases. Such transfers by Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular,

subsidiaries are limited in amount to 10% of the transferring institution&#146;s capital stock and
surplus and, with respect to the Corporation and all of its non-banking subsidiaries, to an
aggregate of 20% of the transferring institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus. For these purposes an
institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus includes its total risk-based capital plus (1)&nbsp;the balance
of its allowance for loan losses not included therein and (2)&nbsp;the amount of certain investments
made by the institution in &#147;financial subsidiaries&#148; that is subject to these limits and is required
to be deducted from the institution&#146;s capital for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, any
such loans and extensions of credit are required to be secured in specified amounts. In addition,
federal law requires that any transaction between Banco Popular, BPNA or Banco Popular, N.A., on
the one hand, and the Corporation, PIB, PNA or any of the Corporation&#146;s other non-banking
subsidiaries, on the other hand, be carried out on an arm&#146;s length basis.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company such as the Corporation, PIB or
PNA is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to
commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when,
absent such policy, the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support. In addition,
any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository institutions are
subordinated in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary
depository institution. In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the
bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository
institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. Banco
Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are currently the only depository institution subsidiaries of
the Corporation, PIB and PNA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Corporation, PIB and PNA are holding companies, their right to participate in the
assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#146;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the
prior claims of the subsidiary&#146;s creditors (including depositors in the case of subsidiary
depository institutions) except to the extent that the Corporation, PIB or PNA, as the case may be,
may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the FDIA, a depository institution, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, can
be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in
connection with (i)&nbsp;the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or
(ii)&nbsp;any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository
institution &#147;in danger of default&#148;. &#147;Default&#148; is defined generally as the appointment of a
conservator or a receiver, and &#147;in danger of default&#148; is defined generally as the existence of
certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory
assistance. Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are currently FDIC-insured depository
institution subsidiaries of the Corporation and are subject to this cross-guarantee liability. In
some circumstances (depending upon the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the
FDIC), cross-guarantee liability may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more
insured depository institutions in a holding company structure. Any obligation or liability owed by
a subsidiary depository institution to its parent company is subordinated to the subsidiary
depository institution&#146;s cross-guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled FDIC-insured
depository institutions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Dividend Restrictions</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal source of cash flow for the Corporation is dividends from Banco Popular. Various
statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends Banco Popular may pay to the Corporation without
regulatory approval. As a member bank subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, Banco
Popular must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all
dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net
income (as reportable in its Report of Condition and Income) for that year, combined with its
retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required
transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member
bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported
in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the
Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be
withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. For this purpose,
permanent capital means the total of the bank&#146;s perpetual preferred stock and related surplus,
common stock and surplus and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, as reportable in the
Report of Condition and Income. At December&nbsp;31, 2007, Banco Popular could have declared a dividend
of approximately $45&nbsp;million without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board and BPNA could not
declare any dividends without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment of dividends by Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. may also be affected
by other regulatory requirements and policies, such as the maintenance of adequate capital. If, in
the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a depository institution under its jurisdiction
is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (that, depending on the
financial condition of the depository institution, could include the payment of dividends), such
authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such depository institution cease and desist
from such practice. The OCC and FDIC have

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if the
payment would deplete a depository institution&#146;s capital base to an inadequate level. Under the
FDIA, an insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become
undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. See &#147;&#151;Prompt Corrective Action&#148; above.
Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that the
bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current
operating earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,
subject to compliance with certain conditions, distributions of U.S. sourced dividends to a
corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico are subject to a withholding tax of 10% instead of the 30%
applied to other foreign corporations. The
Corporation&#146;s U.S. mainland subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently invested. Accordingly,
this 2004 law which lowered the withholding tax rate to 10% is not expected to have a material
impact on the Corporation in the foreseeable future.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments.
In 2006 the President signed the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the &#147;Reform Act&#148;).
The Reform Act provided for the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund (&#147;BIF&#148;) and Savings Association
Insurance Fund (&#147;SAIF&#148;) into a single Deposit Insurance Fund, an increase in the maximum amount of
FDIC insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts, and possible &#147;inflation adjustments&#148; in
the maximum amount of coverage available with respect to other insured accounts. In addition, it
granted a one-time initial assessment credit (of approximately $4.7&nbsp;billion) to recognize
institutions&#146; past contributions to the fund.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deposits of Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are insured up to the applicable
limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance
assessments to maintain the DIF.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Reform Act, the FDIC made significant changes to its risk-based assessment system so
that effective January&nbsp;1, 2007 the FDIC imposes insurance premiums based upon a matrix that is
designed to more closely tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose. The new
FDIC risk-based assessment system imposed premiums based upon factors that vary depending upon the
size of the bank. These factors are: for banks with less than $10&nbsp;billion in assets &#151; capital
level, supervisory rating, and certain financial ratios; for banks with $10&nbsp;billion up to
$30&nbsp;billion in assets &#151; capital level, supervisory rating, certain financial ratios and (if at
least one is available) debt issuer ratings, and additional risk information; and for banks with
over $30&nbsp;billion in assets &#151; capital level, supervisory rating, debt issuer ratings (unless none
are available in which case certain financial ratios are used), and additional risk information.
The FDIC has adopted a new base schedule of rates that the FDIC can adjust up or down, depending on
the revenue needs of the DIF, and has set initial premiums that range from 5&nbsp;cents per $100 of
domestic deposits for the banks in the lowest risk category to 43&nbsp;cents per $100 of domestic
deposits for banks in the highest risk category. The new assessment system is expected to result in
increased annual assessments on the deposits of our bank subsidiaries of 5 to 7 basis points per
$100 of deposits. Our bank subsidiaries will utilize the
$8&nbsp;million remaining balance of the FDIC credit to
offset a portion of the 2008 insurance premium assessment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 separated the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;)
assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the DIF assessment. The amount
assessed on individual institutions by the FICO is in addition to the amount, if any, paid for
deposit insurance according to the FDIC&#146;s risk-related assessment rate schedules. The current FICO
annual assessment is 1.14 cents per $100 of deposits. The above-referenced FDIC credit may not be
used to offset FICO assessments. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Corporation had a DIF deposit
assessment base of approximately $27.6&nbsp;billion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FDIC regulations adopted under FDIA govern the receipt of brokered deposits. Under these
regulations, a bank cannot accept, roll over or renew brokered deposits (which term is defined also
to include any deposit with an interest rate more than 75 basis points above prevailing rates)
unless it is (i)&nbsp;well capitalized or (ii)&nbsp;adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the
FDIC. A bank that is adequately capitalized may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess
of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates specified by regulation. There are no such
restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized. The Corporation does not believe the brokered
deposits regulation has had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of Banco
Popular, BPNA or Banco Popular, N.A.

the four previous years is presented in Table I &#147;Capital Adequacy Data&#148; on page 36 in the
&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; (&#147;MD&#038;A&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and
member banks, the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital (&#147;Total Capital&#148;) to risk-weighted
assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. Under
the capital guidelines, a banking organization&#146;s Total Capital is divided into tiers. &#147;Tier 1
Capital&#148; consists of common equity, retained earnings, minority interest in equity accounts of
consolidated subsidiaries, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount
of cumulative perpetual preferred stock less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Not more
than 25% of qualifying Tier 1 Capital may consist of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, trust
preferred securities or other &#147;so-called&#148; restricted core capital elements. &#147;Tier 2 Capital&#148;
consists of, among other things, a limited amount of subordinated debt, other preferred stock,
certain other instruments and a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves. &#147;Tier 3 Capital&#148;
consists of qualifying unsecured subordinated debt. The sum of Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may not
exceed the amount of Tier 1 Capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for
bank holding companies and member banks. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1
Capital to total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below (the
&#147;leverage ratio&#148;) of 3% for bank holding companies and member banks that have the highest
regulatory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s market risk capital measure. All
other bank holding companies and member banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of
4%. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making
acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum
supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the guidelines
indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider a &#147;tangible Tier 1 leverage
ratio&#148; and other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new
activities. The tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization&#146;s Tier 1
Capital less all intangibles, to total assets less all intangibles.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to the risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted
by the Federal Reserve Board. Banco Popular, N.A. is subject to substantially similar requirements
of the OCC. See Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 21 &#147;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#148; on
page 112 and 113 for the capital ratios of the Corporation, Banco Popular and BPNA. Failure to meet
capital guidelines could subject the Corporation and its depository institution subsidiaries to a
variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and to
certain restrictions on its business. See &#147;- Prompt Corrective Action&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November&nbsp;2007, the Federal Reserve Board approved the final rules to implement new risk
based capital requirements in the United States for large, internationally active banking
organizations. The new advanced capital adequacy framework, known as Basel II would replace the
current U.S. capital rules which are based on the Basel Capital Accord of 1988 (Basel I). Basel II
would be mandatory for core banking organizations which are institutions with at least $250&nbsp;billion
in total assets or at least $10&nbsp;billion

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">in foreign exposure and optional for others (non-core banking organizations which include
opt-in banks voluntarily adopting Basel II and general banks not adopting advanced approaches).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new U.S. Basel II rule is technically consistent with the international approaches and
includes prudential safeguards for the implementation process. These safeguards include a
requirement that banking organizations must successfully complete a four-quarter parallel run
period before operating under the new capital framework and a requirement that an institution
satisfactorily completes three transitional periods (each lasting at least one year) in which
floors are applied to capital requirements. Also, there is a commitment by the agencies to perform
ongoing analysis to ensure Basel II is working as intended. A banking organization would need
approval from its primary federal regulator to move into each transitional floor period and then to
move to full Basel II.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To correct differences between core and non-core banking organizations, Basel IA was proposed
on 2005. On July&nbsp;2007, regulators discarded Basel IA and agreed to issue a proposed rule that
would provide all non-core banking organizations with an option to adopt a standardized approach
under Basel II. This framework is intended to be finalized before the core banking organizations
may begin the first transitional floor period under Basel II (2009). Although the Corporation is a non-core banking organization, the Corporation understands that
the new capital adequacy guidelines provide a framework which more closely aligns regulatory
capital requirements with actual risks, thus enhancing risk management practices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#147;FASB&#148;) issued FASB
Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (&#147;FIN 46&#148;), which addresses the
consolidation rules to be applied to &#147;variable interest entities&#148; as defined in FIN 46. In December
2003 the FASB amended FIN 46 in FASB interpretation No.&nbsp;46 (revised December&nbsp;2003) (&#147;FIN 46R&#148;). FIN
46R, applies to certain variable interest entities by no later than March&nbsp;15, 2004. Under FIN 46R
issuer trusts may constitute variable interest entities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, issuer trusts that issued trust preferred securities have been consolidated by
their parent companies and the accounts of such issuer trusts have been included in the
consolidated financial statements of such parent companies. In addition, trust preferred securities
have been treated as eligible for Tier 1 capital treatment by bank holding companies under Federal
Reserve rules and regulations relating to minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated
subsidiaries. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, $824&nbsp;million in trust preferred securities that the
Corporation treated as Tier 1 capital under existing Federal Reserve Board guidelines were
outstanding. The Corporation has determined that the issuer trusts for its trust preferred
securities transactions are variable interest entities. The variable interest entities were
deconsolidated commencing with the Corporation&#146;s December&nbsp;31, 2003 financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued
limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies
(BHCs). Under the final rule, trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements
became subject to stricter quantitative limits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s final rule limits restricted core capital elements to 25&nbsp;percent
of all core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability.
Internationally active BHCs, defined as those with consolidated assets greater than $250&nbsp;billion or
on-balance-sheet foreign exposure greater than $10&nbsp;billion, are subject to a 15&nbsp;percent limit. They
may, however, include qualifying mandatory convertible preferred securities up to the generally
applicable 25&nbsp;percent limit. Amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of these limits
generally may be included in Tier 2 capital. The final rule provides a five-year transition period,
ending March&nbsp;31, 2009, for application of the quantitative limits.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 amended the FDIA to
permit a bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire banks located in
states other than the holding company&#146;s home state without regard to whether the transaction is
prohibited under state law. In addition, national and state banks with different home states are
permitted to merge across state lines, with approval of the appropriate federal banking agency.
States are also allowed to permit de novo interstate branching. Once a bank has established
branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish or acquire
additional branches at any location in the state where any bank involved in the interstate merger
transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. A
bank that has established a branch in a state through de novo branching (if permitted under state
laws) may establish and acquire additional branches in such state in the same manner and to the
same extent as a bank having a branch in such state as a result of an interstate merger. If a state
opted out of interstate branching within the specified time period, no bank in any other state may
establish a branch in the state that has opted out, whether through an acquisition or de novo. For purposes of
the Riegle-Neal Act amendments to the FDIA, Banco Popular is treated as a state bank and is subject
to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks. However, for purposes of the
International Banking Act (the &#147;IBA&#148;), Banco Popular is considered to be a foreign bank and may
branch interstate by merger or de&nbsp;novo to the same extent as a domestic bank in Banco Popular&#146;s
home state, which is New York for purposes of the IBA. The Corporation has not yet determined how
these statutes will be harmonized, with respect either to which federal agency will approve
interstate transactions or with respect to which &#147;home state&#148; determination rules will apply.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was enacted on November&nbsp;12, 1999. Among other things, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: (i)&nbsp;allows bank holding companies whose subsidiary depository institutions
meet management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially
broader range of nonbanking activities than was previously permissible, including insurance
underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies; (ii)
allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks; (iii)&nbsp;removes various
restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and
mutual fund advisory companies; and (iv)&nbsp;establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to
bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a bank holding company to engage in the broader range of activities that are
permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (i)&nbsp;all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be
well capitalized (as described above) and well managed and (ii)&nbsp;it must file a declaration with the
Federal Reserve that it elects to be a &#147;financial holding company.&#148; The Corporation, PIB and PNA
have elected to be treated as financial holding companies. A depository institution is deemed to be
&#147;well managed&#148; if at its most recent inspection, examination or subsequent review by the
appropriate federal banking agency (or the appropriate state banking agency), the depository
institution received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; composite rating and at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148;
rating for management. In addition, to commence any new activity permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and to acquire any company engaged in any new activities permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding
company must have received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating in its most recent examination under
the Community Reinvestment Act.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also modified other laws, including laws related to financial
privacy and community reinvestment. The new financial privacy provisions generally prohibit
financial institutions, including the Corporation&#146;s bank subsidiaries, from disclosing nonpublic
personal financial information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to &#147;opt out&#148;
of the disclosure.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;26, 2001, the President signed into law comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation
known as the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;). Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act
substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing
significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and
expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Treasury Department (the &#147;Treasury&#148;) has issued and, in some cases proposed, a number
of regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act that apply certain of its requirements to financial
institutions, including the Corporation&#146;s bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries. The regulations
impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and
controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the
identity of customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on
financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S.
financial institutions or persons.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act&#146;s requirements could
have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. The Corporation believes that
the cost of compliance with Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act is not likely to be material to the
Corporation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to help serve the credit needs of their
communities, including credit to low and moderate income individuals and geographies. Should the
Corporation or its bank subsidiaries fail to serve adequately the community, potential penalties
may include regulatory denials of applications to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and
affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or purchase other financial
institutions.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated
foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#147;OFAC&#148; rules based on
their administration by the U.S.&nbsp;Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;). The
OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they
contain one or more of the following elements: (i)&nbsp;restrictions on trade with or investment in a
sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a
sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#147;U.S.&nbsp;persons&#148; engaging in financial transactions relating
to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to a sanctioned
country; and (ii)&nbsp;a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of
the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to
U.S.&nbsp;jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S.&nbsp;persons). Blocked assets
(e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any
manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal
and reputational consequences.

Congress. The Corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that such potential legislation, if
enacted, or implementing regulations would have upon its financial condition or results of
operations.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>General. </I></B>As a commercial bank organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, Banco Popular is
subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial
Institutions of Puerto Rico (the &#147;Office of the Commissioner&#148;), pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking
Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Banking Law&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the yearly net
income of Banco Popular be credited annually to a reserve fund. This apportionment must be done
every year until the reserve fund is equal to the total of paid-in capital on common and preferred
stock. During 2007 Banco Popular transferred $28&nbsp;million to the reserve fund in order to comply
with this requirement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater
than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the
undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve
fund. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the
outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared
until capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original
capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve that, except as
otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less than 20% of its demand
liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by
collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a state of the United
States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that
state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the
reserve requirements of Section&nbsp;16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated
November&nbsp;24, 1982, Banco Popular has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal
Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, Banco Popular is
subject to the reserve requirements prescribed by the Banking Law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to any one person, firm,
partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of fifteen percent (15%) of the paid-in
capital and reserve fund of the bank. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, the legal lending limit for the Bank
under this provision was approximately $119&nbsp;million. In the case
of loans
which are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the
amount of the loan the maximum
aggregate amount is increased to one third of the paid-in capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the
institution is well capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the
Office of the Commissioner or any regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15%
of 50% of its undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than
the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided
profits. Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional
component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the
Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section&nbsp;17 on the amount of loans that are wholly
secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United
States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or
instrumentalities of Puerto Rico.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;14 of the Banking Law authorizes a bank to conduct certain financial and related
activities directly or through subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal property,
originating and servicing mortgage loans and operating a small loan company. Banco Popular engages
in these activities through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Popular Auto, Inc., Popular Mortgage,
Inc. and Popular Finance, Inc., respectively, all of which are organized and operate in Puerto
Rico.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Board, which includes as its members the Commissioner of Financial Institutions,
the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Consumer Affairs, the
President of the Planning Board, and the President of the Government Development Bank for Puerto
Rico, has the authority to regulate the maximum interest rates and finance charges that may be

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IBC Act empowers the Office of the Commissioner to revoke or suspend, after a hearing, the

the Office of the Commissioner finds that the business of the IBE is conducted in a manner not
consistent with the public interest.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2004, the Government of Puerto Rico approved a legislation that partially
eliminates the tax exempt status of an IBE that operates as a division or branch of a bank in
Puerto Rico. In order to be subject to tax, the IBE&#146;s net taxable income must exceed 40% in 2004,
30% in 2005, and 20% in 2006 and thereafter, of the net taxable
income of the bank as a whole. If these thresholds are exceeded, the IBE will be taxed at regular tax rates on its net taxable income
that exceeds the applicable threshold. Currently, management of the Corporation does not expect any
financial impact from this law because the net taxable income of Banco Popular&#146;s IBE has not
exceeded and is not expected to exceed 20% of Banco Popular&#146;s net taxable income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2005, the Government of Puerto Rico approved an increase in the maximum statutory
tax rate from 39.0% to 41.5% to corporations and partnerships for a two-year period. The tax rate
was applied retroactively effective January&nbsp;1, 2005 to all of the Corporation&#146;s subsidiaries doing
business in Puerto Rico with fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2005. In addition, in May&nbsp;2006, the
Government of Puerto Rico approved an additional one year transitory tax applicable only to the banking
industry that raised the maximum statutory tax rate to 43.5% for taxable years commenced during
calendar year 2006. For taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2006, the maximum statutory tax
rate was 39%.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early 2007, the Corporation changed its basis of presentation by combining the operations
of Banco Popular North America and Popular Financial Holdings segments into a single reportable
segment named Popular North America. This was the result of the previously mentioned restructuring
plan of the Popular Financial Holdings operations and the Corporation&#146;s U.S. Reorganization. At
that time, the Corporation decided to continue the operations of
Equity One and its subsidiaries which are principally dedicated to direct subprime loan origination, consumer
finance and mortgage servicing. However, given the unforeseen disruption in the capital markets
since the summer of 2007 and its impact on funding, management now believes that it will be
difficult to generate an adequate return on the capital invested at
Equity One and its subsidiaries. As such, commencing
in late fourth quarter of 2007, the Corporation redefined its Popular North America reportable
segment by segregating it in two separate reportable segments: Banco Popular North America and
Popular Financial Holdings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management re-defined its plans and allocation of resources with respect to the Corporation&#146;s
U.S. operations and is taking steps to exit the PFH business, except for its mortgage servicing
unit. Part of these steps included the recharacterization of a substantial portion of PFH&#146;s
on-balance sheet mortgage loan securitization as sales, the signing in early 2008 of an Asset
Purchase Agreement to sell certain assets of Equity One and the expected closure of its remaining
consumer branch network during 2008. The remaining loan portfolio that will remain in PFH&#146;s books
will decline as it runs-off. Due to the expected discontinuance of the business, management has
redefined how to allocate resources for future growth potential in the U.S. operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management determined the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate
performance and to assess where to allocate resources. The segments were determined based on the
organizational structure, which focuses primarily on the markets the segments serve, as well as on
the products and services offered by the segments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Transactions with Doral Financial Corporation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Doral Announcements. </I></B>In April&nbsp;2005, Doral Financial Corporation (&#147;Doral&#148;) announced that its
previously filed financial statements for periods from January&nbsp;1, 2000 through December&nbsp;31, 2004
should no longer be relied on and that the financial statements for some or all of the periods
included therein should be restated because of issues relating to the methodology used to calculate
the fair value of its portfolio of floating rate interest-only strips (&#147;IOs&#148;). On February&nbsp;27,
2006, Doral filed a Form 10-K/A (Amendment No.&nbsp;1) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 (the
&#147;Amended Doral 2004 10-K&#148;). In the Amended Doral 2004 10-K, Doral stated that it was reducing its
retained earnings through December&nbsp;31, 2004 by $921&nbsp;million on a pre-tax basis and that $596
million of the $921&nbsp;million reduction was attributable to recharacterization of mortgage loan sales
transactions as secured borrowings and $283&nbsp;million was attributable to valuation of IOs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, Doral announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission had approved a
final settlement with Doral, which resolved the SEC&#146;s investigation of Doral. Doral has also stated
that the U.S. Attorney&#146;s Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an
investigation of these matters. Actions have been brought by or on behalf of securities holders of
Doral in relation to these matters. In April&nbsp;2007, Doral agreed to a settlement in which Doral and
its insurers agreed to pay an aggregate of $129&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Estimates of Value Provided by Popular Securities. </I></B>Between October&nbsp;2002 and December&nbsp;2004,
Popular Securities, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, provided quarterly
estimates of the value of portfolios of IOs on behalf of Doral. In accordance with its
understanding regarding the engagement, in providing those estimates of value, Popular Securities
utilized assumptions provided by Doral that may not have been consistent with the actual terms of
the IO portfolios. As originally filed on March&nbsp;15, 2005, Doral&#146;s Form 10-K for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 stated that &#147;to determine the fair value of its IO portfolio&#148;, Doral engaged a
&#147;party&#148; to provide an &#147;external valuation&#148; that &#147;consists of a cash flow valuation model in which
all economic and portfolio assumptions are determined by the preparer&#148;. Popular Securities believes
that this characterization is not appropriate if it was meant to apply to Popular Securities&#146; work.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Amended Doral 2004 10-K, Doral stated that counsel for its Audit Committee and
independent directors had investigated the process it used to obtain &#147;third-party IO valuations&#148;,
that the investigation had concluded that the process &#147;was flawed&#148;, that Doral representatives &#147;may
have improperly provided inaccurate information&#148; concerning the IO portfolio to the parties
performing the third-party valuation, and that the counsel conducting the investigation had
&#147;limited access to the third parties who performed the IO valuation.&#148; The Corporation believes that
Doral considers Popular Securities to be one of the parties that provided Doral with &#147;third-party
IO valuations.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Transactions with Doral Relating to Mortgage Loans and IOs. </I></B>Between 1996 and 2004, BPPR
purchased mortgage loans from Doral for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion.
The remaining balance of these mortgage loans recorded on the Corporation&#146;s consolidated statement
of condition at December&nbsp;31, 2007 was $375&nbsp;million.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first six months of 2000, the Corporation sold mortgage loans to Doral Bank, a
subsidiary of Doral, in two transactions, each for an aggregate sale price of $100&nbsp;million, and
entered into two agreements, contemporaneously with the sale agreements, to purchase mortgage loans
from Doral, each for an aggregate purchase price of $100&nbsp;million. The Corporation recorded a gain
of $2.2&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2000 and of $1.9&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2000 from
the sales of mortgages to Doral Bank.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchases of mortgage loans from Doral for an aggregate price of $1.6&nbsp;billion were often
accompanied by separate recourse and other financial arrangements. The sale of mortgages to Doral
Bank for an aggregate purchase price of $200&nbsp;million were accompanied by separate recourse
arrangements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;15, 2005, Doral announced that it was reversing &#147;a number of transactions
involving the generally contemporaneous purchase and sale of mortgage loans from and to local
financial institutions,&#148; including &#147;transactions covering the purchase and sale of approximately
$200&nbsp;million in mortgages with a local financial institution during 2000&#148; because Doral&#146;s Audit
Committee determined that there was &#147;insufficient contemporaneous documentation regarding the
business purpose for these transactions in light of the timing and similarity of the purchase and
sale amounts and the other terms of the transactions.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the December&nbsp;15, 2005 release, Doral stated that it was treating the sales of mortgage
loans by it as &#147;loans payable secured by mortgage loans.&#148; The Corporation believes that the
contemporaneous purchases and sales of mortgage loans entered into by the Corporation were the ones
reversed by Doral.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation has reviewed the foregoing mortgage loan purchase and sale transactions, as
well as the public statements by Doral, and believes that the transactions qualify for sale (or in
the case of purchases, purchase) treatment under the financial accounting standard at that time.
Accordingly, it has not reversed any of these transactions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1996 and 2004, the Corporation purchased IOs from Doral for an aggregate purchase
price of $110&nbsp;million. Over the same period Doral repurchased IOs it had previously sold to the
Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $54&nbsp;million. The remaining balance of these IOs
recorded on the Corporation&#146;s consolidated statement of condition at December&nbsp;31, 2007 was $37
million. These IOs have been reclassified from investments available-for-sale to loans to Doral
because they are accompanied by 100% guarantees from Doral of the principal and the fixed yield and
because of the source of the cash flow for payments on the IOs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Amended Doral 2004 10-K, Doral stated that Doral had &#147;failed to detect, document and
communicate certain side agreements entered into by Doral&#146;s former treasurer guaranteeing a fixed
yield to a purchaser&#148; of its IOs and that this failure &#147;resulted in the improper accounting for
these transactions as sales and the associated improper recognition of gains on sales.&#148; Doral
stated that it reversed the sales of the IOs and recorded the transaction as a secured borrowing.
It also stated that &#147;gains on sales of trading securities&#148; accounted for at the time of the sales
of the IOs were reversed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Transactions with R&#038;G Financial Corporation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>R&#038;G Announcements. </I></B>In April&nbsp;2005, R&#038;G Financial Corporation (&#147;R&#038;G&#148;) announced that its
previously filed financial statements for periods from January&nbsp;1, 2003 through December&nbsp;31, 2004
needed to be restated and should no longer be relied upon because of issues relating to the
methodology used in valuing its portfolio of residual interests retained in certain mortgage loan
transfers. In July&nbsp;2005, R&#038;G further announced that its previously filed financial statements for
period from January&nbsp;1, 2002 through December&nbsp;31, 2002 needed to be restated and should no longer be
relied upon. On November&nbsp;2, 2007, R&#038;G filed a Form 10-K/A (Amendment No.&nbsp;1) for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 (the &#147;Amended R&#038;G 2004 10-K&#148;). In the Amended R&#038;G 2004 10-K, R&#038;G stated that it
was reducing its retained earnings and capital reserves through December&nbsp;31, 2004 by $345&nbsp;million
on a pre-tax basis and that $237&nbsp;million of the $345&nbsp;million reduction was attributable to
recharacterization of certain mortgage loan transfers as secured borrowings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing market in the U.S. is undergoing a correction of historic proportions. After a
period of several years of booming housing markets, fueled by liberal credit conditions and rapidly
rising property values, since early 2007, the sector has been in the midst of a substantial
dislocation, since 2007. It has had a significant impact on some of the Corporation&#146;s U.S-based
business sectors and has the potential to affect its ongoing financial results and condition. The
general level of property values in the U.S., as measured by several indices widely followed by the
market, has declined. These declines are the result of ongoing market adjustments that are aligning
property values with income levels and home inventories. The supply of homes in the market has
increased substantially, and additional property value decreases may be required to clear the
overhang of excess inventory in the U.S. market. Declining property values could impact the credit
quality of the Corporation&#146;s U.S. mortgage loan portfolio because the value of the homes
underlying the loans is a primary source of repayment in the event of foreclosure. It is possible
that in the event of foreclosure in a loan from this portfolio, the current market value of the
underlying collateral is insufficient to cover the loan amount owed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exposure of the Corporation&#146;s loan portfolio to the 1-4 family residential mortgage sector
in the U.S. has declined. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, mortgage loans collateralized by 1-4 family
residential property in the continental U.S. amounted to $4.7&nbsp;billion, as compared to $9.2&nbsp;billion
as of December&nbsp;31, 2006. This represents a decrease of $4.5&nbsp;billion, or 49%. As of year-end 2007,
$2.4&nbsp;billion in 1-4 family residential mortgage loans in the U.S. were at PFH and $2.3&nbsp;billion at
BPNA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation has made loans to borrowers that had FICO scores 660 or
below through its
subsidiary PFH. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, approximately 75% of PFH&#146;s mortgage loan portfolio of $1
billion was subprime, meaning that it had a credit score per loan of 660 or below. This profile of
borrower has been particularly affected by the current housing environment. Even though the
Corporation has exited this business segment, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses
on the remaining loans in portfolio could continue rising in the current environment. Rising
unemployment, higher interest rates on mortgage loans, declines in housing prices and an overall
tightening of credit standards by lenders tend to have a greater negative effect on the ability of
such borrowers to repay their mortgage loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
additional risk factor related to the residential mortgage loan sector is the repricing of
adjustable rate mortgage loans (&#147;ARMs&#148;). Of the subprime mortgage loans held-in-portfolio at PFH as
of year-end 2007, $320&nbsp;million or 32% were ARMs. These loans typically have a low fixed rate for
an initial period (two or three years) and afterwards the rate &#147;floats&#148; or adjusts periodically
based on a market rate of interest, such as LIBOR. Many of the ARMs currently outstanding are
schedule to reset before the end of 2008. It is possible that in some of these loans, when rates
adjust, there will be a substantial increase in the underlying loan payment, possibly enough to
pressure the cash flow of the underlying debtor and increase the
likehood of delinquency.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could harm the
Corporation&#146;s ability to sell loans, the prices it receives for its loans, the values of its
mortgage loans held-for-sale or its residual interests in securitizations, which could harm the
Corporation&#146;s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any material decline in
real estate values would weaken the Corporation&#146;s collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the
possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. In such event, the Corporation will be subject to the
risk of loss on such mortgage assets arising from borrower defaults, to the extent not covered by
third-party credit enhancement.

fee income. The Corporation may also experience significant losses on the loan portfolio due to a
higher level of defaults on commercial loans, consumer loans and residential mortgages.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Financial results are constantly exposed to market risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the market
value of assets and liabilities due to interest rate volatility. Despite the varied nature of
market risks, the primary source of this risk to the Corporation is the impact of changes in
interest rates on net interest income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated on earning assets and the
interest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics of
the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could either
increase or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structure
of the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature
or reprice in that period. Any mismatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
is known as a gap position. A positive gap denotes asset sensitivity, which means that an increase
in interest rates could have a positive effect on net interest income, while a decrease in interest
rates could have a negative effect on net interest income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is subject to interest rate risk because of the following factors:

    <TD>Assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different
amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates is
rising, we may increase rates charged on loans by an amount that is
less than the general increase in market interest rates because of
intense pricing competition. Also, basis risk occurs when assets and
liabilities have similar repricing frequencies but are tied to
different market interest rate indices that may not move in tandem.</TD>

mortgage interest rates decline sharply, mortgage-backed securities

significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduce portfolio
income. If prepayment rates increase, the Corporation would be
required to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period of
time, thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interest
income. Prepayment risk also has a significant impact on
mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations,
since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these
portfolios.</TD>

sales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other
alternatives. The Corporation may suffer losses or experience lower spreads than anticipated in
initial projections as management implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation uses derivatives, to a limited extent, to manage part of the exposure to
market risk caused by changes in interest rates or basis risk. The derivative instruments that the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit ratings are an important component of the Corporation&#146;s liquidity profile. Among other
factors, credit ratings are based on the financial strength, the credit quality of and
concentrations in the Corporations&#146; loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital
adequacy, the quality of management, the liquidity of the Corporation&#146;s balance sheet, the
availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to
access a broad array of wholesale funding sources.

senior debt rating of the Corporation and reduced the short-term rating to &#147;P-2&#148;. The ratings were
put on &#147;watch negative&#148;. The funding challenges at the bank holding company as well as the
profitability of the U.S. business were given as the primary concerns underlying the downgrades. In
January, 2008, Moodys upgraded the ratings outlook to &#147;stable&#148; and removed the ratings watch which
has been in effect. Initiatives completed by management to address the bank holding companies&#146;
funding challenges were cited as prompting the change, although the profitability of the U.S.
business continues to be a ratings concern.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the third quarter of 2007, Fitch Ratings reduced the short-term credit rating
of Popular, Inc. and Popular North America, Inc. to &#147;F-2&#148; from &#147;F-1&#148;, and placed their long senior
rating of &#147;A-&#148; on negative rating watch. Fitch Ratings mentioned that the rating actions reflected
credit quality pressures from our sub-prime loan exposure as well as a more difficult environment
for bank holding company funding. In both cases, Fitch Ratings maintained that it believes that
both situations are challenging but manageable. In January, 2008, Fitch Ratings announced that it
was affirming the Corporation&#146;s senior debt rating at &#147;A-&#147; as well as removing the rating from
&#147;watch negative&#148;. The outlook was maintained &#147;negative&#148;. Management actions related to bank holding
company liquidity were highlighted by the agency as underlying the removal of the &#147;watch&#148;, but U.S.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the Corporation&#146;s credit ratings or the credit ratings of any of its subsidiaries
to a level below &#147;investment grade&#148; would adversely affect the Corporation&#146;s ability to raise funds
in the capital markets. The Corporation&#146;s counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a
ratings downgrade. In the event of a downgrade, the cost of borrowing funds would increase. In
addition, the Corporation&#146;s ability to raise new funds in the capital markets or renew maturing
debt may be impaired.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits depends on
various factors, including service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by the
operating results and credit ratings by nationally recognized credit agencies. A downgrade in
credit ratings may impact the ability to raise deposits, but the Corporation believes that the
impact should not be material. Deposits at all of its banking subsidiaries are federally insured
(subject to limitations established by the FDIC), which is
expected to mitigate the effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Government&#146;s fiscal challenges in 2006, Moodys and S&#038;P then downgraded the
rating of its obligations, but maintaining them within investment-grade levels. Since then, actions
by the Government have improved the credit outlook. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, S&#038;P rated the
Government&#146;s general obligations at BBB-, while Moodys rated them at Baa3- both in the lowest notch
of investment grade. In November&nbsp;2007, Moody&#146;s upgraded the outlook of the Commonwealth&#146;s credit
ratings to &#147;stable&#148; from &#147;negative&#148; In justifying their change in outlook, Moody&#146;s recognized the
progress the Commonwealth has made in addressing the fiscal challenges it has faced in recent
years. In particular it mentioned the controls imposed on public spending and the implementation of
the sales tax as two favorable developments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors such as the government&#146;s ability to implement meaningful steps to curb operating
expenditures, improve managerial and budgetary controls, and eliminate the government&#146;s reliance on
operating budget loans from the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico will be key determinants
of future ratings stability. Also, the inability to agree on future fiscal year Commonwealth
budgets could result in ratings pressure from the rating agencies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgrade
in Puerto Rico&#146;s debt obligations. However, a deterioration in the fiscal situation with possible
negative ratings implications, could adversely affect the value of Puerto Rico&#146;s Government
obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A substantial portion of the Corporation&#146;s credit exposure to the Government of Puerto Rico is
either collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues
identified for their repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans
to public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as
water and electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from
the central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from the central
Government. The Corporation also has loans to various municipalities for which the good faith,
credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has been pledged to their
repayment. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts
as shall be required for the payment of all of its general obligation bonds and loans. Another
portion of these loans consist of special obligations of various municipalities that are payable
from the basic real and personal property taxes collected within such municipalities. The full good
faith and credit obligations of the municipalities have a first lien on the basic property taxes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Corporation had $1.0&nbsp;billion of credit facilities granted to or
guaranteed by the P.R. Government and its political subdivisions, of which $150&nbsp;million are
uncommitted lines of credit. Of these total credit facilities
granted, $914&nbsp;million in loans were
outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2007. A substantial portion of the credit exposure to the Government of
Puerto Rico has an identified repayment stream, which includes in some cases the good faith, credit
and unlimited taxation power of certain municipalities and, an assignment of basic property taxes
and other revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as of December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Corporation had outstanding $178&nbsp;million in
Obligations of Puerto Rico, States and Political Subdivisions as part of its investment portfolio.
Of that portfolio, $55&nbsp;million was in the form of Puerto Rico Commonwealth&#146;s Appropriation Bonds,
which are currently rated Ba1, one notch below investment grade, by Moody&#146;s and BBB-, the lowest
investment grade rating, by S&#038;P, another nationally recognized credit rating agency. At
December&nbsp;31, 2007, the Appropriation Bonds indicated above represented approximately $1.8&nbsp;million
in unrealized losses in the Corporation&#146;s portfolio of investment securities available- for- sale.
The Corporation is closely monitoring the political and economic situation of the Island and
evaluates the portfolio for any declines in value that management may consider being other- than-
temporary. Management has the intent and ability to hold these investments for a reasonable period
of time or up to maturity for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to (or beyond) the cost of
these investments.

successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our position. Additionally, continued
loss from operations in future reporting periods may require us to adjust the valuation allowance
against our deferred tax assets.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we are audited by various federal, state and local authorities regarding
income tax matters. Significant judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes
and our liabilities for federal, state, local and other taxes. Our audits are in various stages of
completion; however, no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to
the conclusion of the audit, appeal and, in some cases, litigation process. Although we believe our
approach to determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes,&#148; and FASB
Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,&#148; it is possible that the final
tax authority will take a tax position that is materially different than that which is reflected in
our income tax provision and other tax reserves. As each audit is conducted, adjustments, if any,
are appropriately recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period determined. Such
differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision or benefit, or other
tax reserves, in the reporting period in which such determination is made and, consequently, on our
results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows for such period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance, if, based on the weight of
available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. In determining the more-likely-than-not criterion, we evaluate all positive
and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments, either increases
or decreases, to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be determined based upon changes
in the expected realization of our net deferred tax assets. The realization of our deferred tax
assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or
carryforward periods under the tax law. Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the
valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably
possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future
reporting periods. Our results of operations would be impacted negatively if we determine that
increases to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance are required in a future reporting period.

effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of
Directors less responsive to stockholder control.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of
Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of
stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year
term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore,
control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings
must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. The
Corporation&#146;s certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of
Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds of
the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of
directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of
Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These
provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire the Corporation because
of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result,
may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital
stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for
the Corporation&#146;s capital stock.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation previously filed two registration statements covering the offering of the
Corporation&#146;s common stock, at market prices, as an investment option for employee and employer
contributions under the following plans for its U.S.-based employees: the Popular Financial
Holdings, Inc. Savings and Retirement Plan (formerly known as the Equity One, Inc. Savings and
Retirement Plan (the &#147;PFH Plan&#148;)) and the Popular, Inc. USA 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (the
&#147;U.S. Surviving Plan&#148;). Effective April&nbsp;1, 2006, the PFH Plan was merged with and into the U.S.
Surviving Plan. As a result of an error in recordkeeping and the merger of the PFH Plan with and
into the U.S. Surviving Plan and the participation of E-LOAN employees in the Plan starting January
1, 2007, the latter two of which had the effect of significantly increasing the number of
participants in the U.S. Surviving Plan, the amount of shares issued under the U.S. Surviving Plan
has exceeded the amount of shares registered. For the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2007, the number
of unregistered shares sold under the U.S. Surviving Plan was 76,236 shares. The Corporation has
determined that the offer and sale of the shares and interests in the U.S. Surviving Plan above the
amount registered were not exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and that such sale
should have been registered under the Securities Act. Under the applicable provisions of the
federal securities laws, plan participants that purchased unregistered shares of common stock may
seek to rescind the transaction within one year following the date of purchase. Approximately
686,487 unregistered shares were sold to plan participants under the U.S. Surviving Plan from
August&nbsp;9, 2006 to August&nbsp;8, 2007 which covers the one year period (the &#147;Rescission Period&#148;) prior
to the filing of the registration statement referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph.
All shares of common stock under all the above-referenced Plans were purchased by the Plans on
the open market. During that period, the Corporation&#146;s common stock price ranged from a low of $12.47 per share to a
high of $20.12 per share. The closing price of the Corporation&#146;s common stock on November&nbsp;7, 2007
was $9.22 per share. On August&nbsp;9, 2007, the Corporation registered 5,000,000 shares of common stock
and related interests in the U.S. Surviving Plan for offer to plan participants.
</DIV>

taxes, plus fixed charges. Fixed charges represent all interest expense (ratios are presented both
excluding and including interest on deposits), the portion of net rental expense, which is deemed

expense includes changes in the fair value of the non-hedging derivatives.
