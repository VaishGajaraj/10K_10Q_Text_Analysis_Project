is a diversified, publicly-owned financial holding company, registered under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;BHC Act&#148;) and subject to supervision and regulation
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#147;Federal Reserve Board&#148;). Popular was
incorporated in 1984 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and is the largest financial
institution based in Puerto Rico, with consolidated assets of $38.7&nbsp;billion, total deposits of
$26.8&nbsp;billion and stockholders&#146; equity of $3.8&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2010. At December&nbsp;31, 2010,
we ranked 38th among bank holding companies based on total assets according to information gathered
and disclosed by the Federal Reserve Board.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We operate in two principal markets:</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&#149;</B> Puerto Rico: We provide retail and commercial banking services through our principal
banking subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (&#147;BPPR&#148;), as well as auto and equipment leasing
and financing, mortgage loans, investment banking, broker-dealer and insurance services through
specialized subsidiaries.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&#149;</B> Mainland United States: We operate Banco Popular North America (&#147;BPNA&#148;), including its
wholly-owned subsidiary E-LOAN, Inc. (&#147;E-LOAN&#148;). BPNA is a community bank providing a broad range
of financial services and products to the communities it serves. BPNA operates branches in New
York, California, Illinois, New Jersey and Florida. E-LOAN markets deposit accounts under its name
for the benefit of BPNA.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our two reportable business segments for accounting purposes, BPPR and BPNA, correspond to the
Puerto Rico and mainland United States businesses, respectively. Following the sale in the third
quarter of 2010 of a 51% ownership interest in EVERTEC, Inc. (&#147;EVERTEC&#148;), our financial transaction
processing and technology services business, we report our remaining 49% ownership interest in this
business in our &#147;Corporate&#148; group, which also includes the holding company operations and certain
other equity investments.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sections that follow provide a description of significant transactions that impacted or
will impact the Corporation&#146;s current and future operations.</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Capital Raise</I>.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the
 beginning of 2010,
it was apparent that the  FDIC
was  likely to take action against various
Puerto Rico based commercial banks that were experiencing serious financial difficulties and were
operating under cease and desist orders with their banking regulators, which actions could include
placing the banks into an FDIC-administered receivership. Management decided that our
participation in the consolidation of the Puerto Rico banking
industry that would result from any such
action was in our best interest, both in order to protect our leading market position and to
potentially benefit from acquiring assets and liabilities at an attractive price and with FDIC
assistance to mitigate the risk of credit losses. As a condition to
allowing  us to bid for and acquire a
failed depository institution in Puerto Rico, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC required us to
increase our Tier 1 capital by approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion. As part of our capital plan agreed to
with the FDIC and our primary regulators, during the second quarter of 2010, we completed a capital
issuance of $1.15&nbsp;billion through the sale and subsequent conversion into Common Stock of
depositary shares representing interests in shares of contingent convertible perpetual
non-cumulative preferred stock. This transaction resulted in the issuance of over 383&nbsp;million
additional shares of our Common Stock in May&nbsp;2010 upon conversion. The net proceeds from the
public offering amounted to $1.1&nbsp;billion, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering
expenses. This transaction strengthened the Popular&#146;s capital
base and facilitated our
participation in an FDIC-assisted transaction. In addition, we agreed with our regulators that, if
we were a successful bidder for a failed depository institution in an FDIC-assisted transaction, we
would raise additional capital through the sale of assets or through the issuance of additional
Tier 1 capital, or a combination thereof. The gain recorded from the EVERTEC transaction
described below, together with the $1.1&nbsp;billion capital raise, resulted in approximately $1.6
billion in additional Tier 1 capital, meeting the capital requirement agreed to with our regulators
in order for us to participate and consummate the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Westernbank FDIC-Assisted Transaction</I>.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;30, 2010, BPPR acquired certain assets and assumed certain deposits and liabilities
of Westernbank Puerto Rico, a Puerto Rico state-chartered bank headquartered in Mayaguez, Puerto
Rico (&#147;Westernbank&#148;), from the FDIC in an FDIC-assisted transaction (the &#147;Westernbank
FDIC-assisted transaction&#148;). Westernbank was a wholly-owned commercial bank subsidiary of W
Holding Company, Inc. and operated through a network of 44 branches located throughout Puerto Rico.
On May&nbsp;1, 2010, Westernbank&#146;s branches reopened as branches of BPPR; however, the physical branch
locations and leases were not immediately acquired by BPPR. BPPR had the option to acquire, at
fair market value, any bank premises that were owned, or any leases relating to bank premises held,
by</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Westernbank (including automated teller machine &#147;ATMs&#148; locations). Due to bank synergies, out of the 44 Westernbank
branches, BPPR retained 12 branches and consolidated certain other branches with
existing BPPR branches. The integration of Westernbank&#146;s operations into BPPR was substantially
completed by the end of the third quarter of 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the purchase and assumption agreement, excluding the effects of purchase
accounting adjustments, BPPR acquired approximately $9.1&nbsp;billion in assets, including approximately
$8.6&nbsp;billion in loans and other real estate owned (&#147;OREO&#148;), and assumed $2.4&nbsp;billion of deposits of
Westernbank. The deposits were acquired without a premium and the assets were acquired at a
discount of 12.0% to the former Westernbank&#146;s historic book value. The transaction increased our
total assets and total deposits, excluding fair value adjustments, by 27% and 9%, respectively, as
compared with balances at March&nbsp;31, 2010. In connection with the transaction, BPPR issued a $5.8
billion five-year promissory note bearing interest at an annual rate of 2.50% (the &#147;Purchase Money
Note&#148;) to the FDIC collateralized by certain loans and foreclosed real estate acquired by BPPR from
the FDIC that are subject to loss sharing agreements. As part of the consideration for the
transaction, we also issued an equity appreciation instrument in which the FDIC has the opportunity
to obtain a cash payment from us for a period of one year from the date of the agreement. The
equity appreciation instrument had a fair value of $52.5&nbsp;million
at April&nbsp;30, 2010. In connection with the
Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, the FDIC retained the majority of the investment securities, outstanding
borrowings and substantially all of the brokered certificates of deposit of Westernbank.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously with the acquisition, BPPR entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC,
whereby the FDIC agreed to cover a substantial portion of any future losses on acquired loans and
OREO, as long as BPPR complies with the requirements stipulated in them. We refer to the acquired
assets subject to the loss sharing agreement collectively as &#147;covered assets.&#148; Under the terms of
the loss sharing agreements, the FDIC will absorb 80% of losses with respect to the covered assets. The term of the single-family residential mortgage loss sharing agreement is 10
years, and under this agreement the reimbursable losses, computed monthly, are offset by any
recoveries with respect to such losses. The term of the commercial loans loss sharing agreement is
8&nbsp;years, comprised of a 5-year shared-loss period followed by a 3-year recovery period. During the
5-year shared-loss period, the FDIC will reimburse BPPR for 80% of losses, net of recoveries during
each quarter. During the 3-year recovery period, BPPR will be required to reimburse the FDIC for
80% of all new recoveries attributable to commercial loans for which reimbursement had been granted
during the shared-loss period. Any amounts payable by the FDIC to BPPR pursuant to the loss
sharing agreements will be applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance of the Purchase
Money Note.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, BPPR has agreed to make a true-up payment to the FDIC on the date that is
45 days following the last day (the &#147;True-Up Measurement Date&#148;) of the final shared
loss month, or upon the final disposition of all covered assets under the loss sharing
agreements in the event losses on the loss sharing agreements fail to reach expected
levels. The estimated fair value of such true-up payment is recorded as a reduction in the
fair value of the FDIC loss share indemnification asset. Under the loss sharing
agreements, BPPR will pay to the FDIC 50% of the excess, if any, of: (i) 20% of the
Intrinsic Loss Estimate of $4.6 billion (or $925 million) (as
determined by the FDIC) less
(ii) the sum of: (A) 25% of the asset discount (per bid) (or ($1.1 billion)); plus (B) 25%
of the cumulative shared-loss payments (defined as the aggregate of all of the payments
made or payable to BPPR minus the aggregate of all of the payments made or payable to
the FDIC); plus (C) the sum of the period servicing amounts for every consecutive twelve-month period prior to and ending on the True-Up Measurement Date in respect of each
of the loss sharing agreements during which the loss sharing provisions of the applicable
loss sharing agreement is in effect (defined as the product of the simple average of the
principal amount of shared loss loans and shared loss assets at the beginning and end of
such period times 1%). The true-up payment represents an estimated liability of $169
million. This estimated liability is accounted for as part of the indemnification asset.</div>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, our total assets as of April&nbsp;30,
2010 increased by $8.3&nbsp;billion, principally consisting of a loan portfolio with an estimated fair
value of $5.2&nbsp;billion ($8.6&nbsp;billion unpaid principal balance prior to purchase accounting
adjustments) and a $2.3&nbsp;billion FDIC loss share indemnification asset. Liabilities with a fair
value of approximately $8.3&nbsp;billion were recognized at the acquisition date, including $2.4&nbsp;billion
of assumed deposits, the Purchase Money Note and the equity appreciation instrument. The
indemnification asset represents the portion of estimated losses covered by the loss sharing
agreements between BPPR and the FDIC. We recorded goodwill of $87&nbsp;million as part of the
transaction.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until September&nbsp;30, 2010, we operated a financial transaction processing and technology
services business through our wholly-owned subsidiary EVERTEC, which constituted a separate
reportable segment. EVERTEC provided transaction processing services in Puerto Rico, Florida,
Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Costa Rica, as well as internally serviced many
of our subsidiaries&#146; system infrastructures and transactional processing businesses. EVERTEC owns

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We entered into a merger agreement, dated as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, to sell a 51% interest in
EVERTEC, including the merchant acquiring business of BPPR (the &#147;EVERTEC transaction&#148;), to funds
managed by Apollo Management, L.P. (&#147;Apollo&#148;) in a leveraged buyout. In connection with the
EVERTEC transaction, we and our subsidiaries completed an internal reorganization transferring
certain intellectual property assets and interests in certain foreign subsidiaries to EVERTEC,
including BPPR&#146;s merchant acquiring business and TicketPop divisions. We retained EVERTEC&#146;s
operations in Venezuela and certain related contracts as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary. We
also retained equity interests in the processing businesses of Servicios Financieros, S.A. de C.V.
(&#147;Serfinsa&#148;) and Consorcio de Tarjetas Dominicanas, S.A. (&#147;CONTADO&#148;). Under the terms of the
merger agreement, we are required for a period of twelve months following the merger to continue to
seek to sell our equity interests in such entities to EVERTEC, subject to complying with certain
rights of first refusal in favor of the Serfinsa and CONTADO shareholders.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;30, 2010, we completed the EVERTEC transaction. Following the consummation of
the EVERTEC transaction, EVERTEC is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Carib Holdings, Inc., a newly
formed entity that is operated as a joint venture, with Apollo and us initially owning 51% and 49%,
respectively, subject to pro rata dilution for certain issuances of capital stock to EVERTEC
management. In connection with the leveraged buyout, EVERTEC issued financing in the form of
unsecured senior notes and a syndicated loan (senior secured credit facility). We invested $35
million in senior unsecured notes issued by EVERTEC ($17.9&nbsp;million,</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EVERTEC transaction resulted in a net gain after taxes and transaction costs of
approximately $531.0&nbsp;million. The net cash proceeds received by us after transaction costs and
taxes were approximately $528.6&nbsp;million. The sale had a positive impact of approximately 2.19% on
Tier 1 Common, 2.31% in Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios, and of approximately 1.20% on

information technology services to us and our subsidiaries and gave BPPR access to the ATH network
owned and operated by EVERTEC by providing various services, in each case for initial terms of
fifteen years.</DIV>

EVERTEC for claims or damages relating to potential violations described in that risk factor. In

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">




<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -5%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>(1)&nbsp;Commercial</U>. Commercial loans are comprised of (i)&nbsp;commercial and industrial
(C&#038;I) loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance
working capital needs, equipment purchases or other projects, and (ii)&nbsp;commercial real
estate (CRE)&nbsp;loans (excluding construction loans) for income producing real estate
properties. C&#038;I loans are underwritten individually and usually secured with the assets
of the company and the personal guarantee of the business owners. CRE loans consist of
loans for income producing real estate properties and real estate developers and the
financing of owner-occupied facilities if there is real estate as collateral. We
mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan
amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability that exceeds debt service
requirements. Non owner-occupied CRE loans are generally made to finance office and
industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows
related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the property.<Br><Br>
Total commercial loans in Puerto Rico were $6.7&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, and represented
48% of our total credit exposure. For greater detail of the breakdown of our Commercial
portfolio refer to the Table under the caption &#147;Business Concentration&#148;.</DIV>





<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -5%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>(2)&nbsp;Construction</U>. Construction loans are CRE loans to companies or developers used
for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be
generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. Our construction loan
portfolio primarily consists of retail, residential (land and condominiums), office and
warehouse product types. These loans are generally underwritten and managed by a
specialized real estate group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages
the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule.<Br><Br>
Total construction loans in Puerto Rico were $168.4&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, and
represented 1% of our total credit exposure. BPPR is currently originating a limited
amount of new construction loans.</DIV>





<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -5%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>(3)&nbsp;Lease Financings</U>. Lease financings are primarily comprised of automobile
loans/leases made through automotive dealerships and equipment lease financings.<Br><Br>
Total lease financings in Puerto Rico were $572.8&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, and
represented 4% of our total credit exposure.</DIV>





<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -5%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>(4)&nbsp;Mortgage</U>. Mortgage loans include residential mortgage loans to consumers for the
purchase or refinancing of a residence and also includes residential construction loans
made to individuals for the construction or refurbishment of their residence. The
majority of these loans are financed over a 15 to 30 year term, and in most cases, the
loans are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. In some cases,
government agencies or private mortgage insurers guarantee the loan. Our general
practice is to sell a significant majority of our fixed-rate originations in the
secondary market.<Br><Br>
Total mortgage loans in Puerto Rico were $3.6&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, and represented
26% of our total credit exposure.</DIV>





<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -5%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>(5)&nbsp;Consumer</U>. Consumer loans include personal loans, credit cards, home equity lines
of credit (&#147;HELOCs&#148;) and other loans made by banks to individual borrowers. In this
area, BPPR offers four unsecured products: personal loans, credit cards, personal
credit lines and overdraft protection. All other consumer loans are secured. HELOCs
includes both home equity loans and lines of credit secured by a first or second
mortgage on the borrower&#146;s residence, which allows customers to borrow against the
equity in their homes. Real estate market values as of the time HELOCs are granted
directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in addition, changes in these values
impact our exposure to losses in this type of loan.<Br><Br>
Total consumer loans in Puerto Rico were $2.9&nbsp;billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, and represented
21% of our total credit exposure.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2011, BPPR signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell approximately $500
million (book value) of construction and commercial real estate loans, approximately 75% of which
are non-performing, to a newly created joint venture that will be majority owned by an unrelated
third party for a purchase price equal to 47% of their unpaid principal balance as of December&nbsp;31,
2010. The loans are part of a portfolio of approximately $603&nbsp;million (book value) of
construction, commercial real estate and land loans that were reclassified as loans held-for-sale
as of December&nbsp;31, 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the transaction, BPPR will make a 24.9% equity investment in the venture. BPPR will
also provide financing to the venture for the acquisition of the loans in an amount equal to 50% of
the purchase price and certain closing costs. In addition, BPPR will provide financing to the
venture to cover unfunded commitments related to certain construction projects (subject to
customary conditions of construction draws) and to fund certain operating expenses of the venture.
The transaction, which is subject to the completion of due diligence and the execution of
definitive documentation, as well as customary closing conditions, is expected to close during the
first quarter of 2011.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Covered Loans.</I></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We refer to the loans acquired in the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, except credit
cards, as &#147;covered loans&#148; as BPPR will be reimbursed by the FDIC for a substantial portion of any
future losses on such loans under the terms of the loss sharing agreements. Foreclosed other real
estate properties are also covered under the loss sharing agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the
loss sharing agreements, the FDIC&#146;s obligation to reimburse BPPR for losses with respect to assets
covered by such agreements (collectively, &#147;covered assets&#148;) begins with the first dollar of loss
incurred. On a combined basis, the FDIC will reimburse BPPR for 80% of all qualifying losses with
respect to the covered assets during the covered period. BPPR will reimburse the FDIC for 80% of
qualifying recoveries with respect to losses for which the FDIC reimbursed BPPR. The loss sharing
agreement applicable to single-family residential mortgage loans provides for FDIC loss sharing and
BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for ten years, and the loss sharing agreement applicable to
commercial and other assets provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for
five years, with additional recovery sharing for three years thereafter.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC, the risks of the covered loans are
significantly different from other loans in our portfolio, thus we have determined to segregate
them in our financial statements and in the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. Covered loans are reported in loans exclusive of the
estimated FDIC loss share indemnification asset. During the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2010,
retrospective adjustments were made to the estimated fair values of the covered loans to reflect
new information obtained during the measurement period (as defined by ASC Topic 805), about facts
and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the
acquisition-date fair value measurements. The retrospective adjustments were mostly driven by
revisions in credit loss assumptions because of new information that became available. The
revisions principally resulted in a decrease in the estimated credit losses, thus increasing the
fair value of acquired loans and reducing the FDIC loss share indemnification asset. Refer to Note
3, &#147;Business Combination&#148;, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on
the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered loans are, and will continue to be, reviewed for collectability, based on the
expectations of cash flows on these loans. If there is a decrease in expected cash flows on the
covered loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 (consisting of all covered loans except for
revolving lines of credit) due to an increase in estimated credit losses compared to the estimate
made at the April&nbsp;30, 2010 acquisition date, we will record a charge to the provision for loan
losses and an allowance for loan losses will be established. If there is an increase in inherent
losses on the covered loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-20 (consisting of revolving lines
of credit), an allowance for loan losses will also be established to record the loans at their net
realizable value. In both cases, a related credit to income and an increase in the FDIC loss share
indemnification asset will be recognized at the same time, measured based on the loss share
percentages described above.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, covered loans totaled $4.8&nbsp;billion, or 12% of assets.</DIV>

as part of the BPNA restructuring plan implemented in late 2008. As a result of these initiatives,
the total assets of Popular Equipment Finance, Inc. were reduced to $28.9&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31,

<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -5%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>(1)&nbsp;Commercial</U>. Commercial loans are comprised of (i)&nbsp;commercial and
industrial (C&#038;I) loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to
finance working capital needs, equipment purchases or other projects, and (ii)&nbsp;commercial
real estate (CRE)&nbsp;loans (excluding construction loans) for income producing real estate
properties. C&#038;I loans are underwritten individually and usually secured with the assets
of the company and the personal guarantee of the business owners. CRE loans consist of
loans for income producing real estate properties and real estate developers and the
financing of owner-occupied facilities if there is real estate as collateral. We
mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan
amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability that exceeds debt service
requirements. Non owner-occupied CRE loans are generally made to finance office and
industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows
related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the property.<br><br></DIV>




<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total
commercial loans at BPNA were $4.7&nbsp;billion as of
December&nbsp;31, 2010, and represented 70% of our total credit exposure.</DIV>





<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -5%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>(2)&nbsp;Construction</U>. Construction loans are CRE loans to companies or developers used for
the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be
generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. Our construction loan
portfolio primarily consists of retail, residential (land and condominiums), office and
warehouse product types. These loans are generally underwritten and managed by a
specialized real estate group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages
the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule.<br><br></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total construction loans at BPNA were $332.5&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, and represented
5% of our total credit exposure. BPNA is not currently originating new construction loans.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -5%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>(3)&nbsp;Lease Financings</U>. Lease financings are primarily comprised of equipment lease
financing. We exited this business in the U.S. mainland. The majority of the lease
equipment financing portfolio was sold during the first quarter of 2009.<br><br></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Total lease financings at BPNA were $30.2&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, and represented
less than one percent of our total credit exposure.<br><br></DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -5%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>(4) Mortgage</U>. Mortgage loans include residential mortgage loans to consumers for the
purchase or refinancing of a residence and also includes residential construction loans
made to individuals for the construction or refurbishment of their residence. The
majority of these loans are financed over a 15 to 30 year term, and in most cases, the
loans are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. In some cases,
government agencies or private mortgage insurers guarantee the loan. Our general
practice is to sell a significant majority of our fixed-rate originations in the
secondary market.<br><br></DIV>

mortgage loans at BPNA were $875 million as of December&nbsp;31,

<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 9%; text-indent: -5%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>(5)&nbsp;Consumer</U>. Consumer loans include personal loans, credit cards, auto loans, HELOCs
and other loans made by banks to individual borrowers. In this area, BPNA offers four
unsecured products: personal loans, credit cards, personal credit lines and overdraft
protection. All other consumer loans are secured.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Credit Administration and Credit Policies</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest
from  our loan portfolios is our principal source of revenue. Whenever we make loans,
we expose ourselves to credit risk. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, our credit exposure was centered in our
$20.7&nbsp;billion non-covered loan portfolio which represented 72% of our
earning assets excluding covered loans. Credit risk is
controlled and monitored through active asset quality management, including the use of lending
standards, thorough review of potential borrowers and active asset quality administration.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business activities that expose us to credit risk are managed within the Board&#146;s established
limits that consider factors such as maintaining a prudent balance of risk-taking across
diversified risk types and business units, compliance with regulatory guidance, controlling the
exposure to lower credit quality assets, and limiting growth in, and overall exposure to, any
product or risk segment where we do not have sufficient experience and a proven ability to predict
credit losses.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Credit Strategy Committee (&#147;CRESCO&#148;) is management&#146;s top policy-making body with respect
to credit-related matters and credit strategies. CRESCO reviews the activities of each subsidiary
to ensure a proactive and coordinated management of credit granting, credit exposures and credit
procedures. CRESCO&#146;s principal functions include reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan
losses and periodically approving appropriate provisions, monitoring compliance with charge-off
policy, establishing portfolio diversification, yield and quality standards, establishing credit
exposure reporting standards, monitoring asset quality, and approving credit policies and
amendments thereto for the subsidiaries and/or business lines, including special lending approval
authorities when and if appropriate. The analysis of the allowance adequacy is presented to the
Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors for review, consideration and ratification on a
quarterly basis.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a Corporate Credit Risk Management Division (&#147;CCRMD&#148;). The CCRMD is a
centralized unit, independent of the lending function. The CCRMD&#146;s functions include identifying,
measuring and controlling credit risk independently from the business units, evaluating the credit
risk rating system and reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) and regulatory standards. The CCRMD also ensures
that the subsidiaries comply with the credit policies and applicable regulations, and monitors
credit underwriting standards. Also, the CCRMD performs ongoing monitoring of the portfolio,
including potential areas of concern for specific borrowers and/or geographic regions.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Credit Process Review Group within the CCRMD, which performs annual comprehensive
credit process reviews of several commercial, construction, consumer and mortgage lending groups in
BPPR. This group evaluates the credit risk profile of each originating unit along with each unit&#146;s
credit administration effectiveness, including the assessment of the risk rating representative of
the current credit quality of commercial and construction loans and the evaluation of collateral
documentation. The monitoring performed by this group contributes to assess compliance with credit
policies and underwriting standards, determine the current level of credit risk, evaluate the
effectiveness of the credit management process and identify control deficiencies that may arise in
the credit-granting process. Based on its findings, the Credit Process Review Group recommends
corrective actions, if necessary, that help in maintaining a sound credit process. In the U.S.
mainland, the Credit Process Review Group evaluates the consumer and mortgage lending groups.
CCRMD has contracted an outside loan review firm to perform the credit process reviews for the
commercial and construction loan portfolios in the U.S. mainland operations. The CCRMD
participates in defining the review plan with the outside loan review firm and actively
participates in the discussions of the results of the loan reviews with the business units. The
CCRMD may periodically review the work performed by the outside loan review firm. The CCRMD
reports the results of the credit process reviews to the Risk Management Committee of our Board of
Directors.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain comprehensive credit policies for all lines of business in order to mitigate
credit risk. Our credit policies are ratified by our Board of Directors and set forth, among other
things, underwriting standards and procedures for monitoring and evaluating loan portfolio quality.
Our credit policies also require prompt identification and quantification of asset quality
deterioration or potential loss in order to ensure the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
Included in these policies, primarily determined by the amount, type of loan and risk
characteristics of the credit facility, are various approval levels and lending limit constraints,
ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our credit policies and procedures establish strict documentation requirements for each loan
and related collateral type, when applicable, during the underwriting, closing and monitoring
phases. During the initial loan underwriting process, the credit policies require, at a minimum,
historical financial statements or tax returns of the borrower and any guarantor, an analysis of
financial information contained in a credit approval package, a risk rating determination in the
case of commercial and construction loans, reports from credit agencies and appraisals for real
estate-related loans. We currently do not make &#147;no doc&#148; or &#147;stated income&#148; loans where there is no
income or asset verification by the lender. The credit policies also set forth the required
closing documentation depending on the loan and the collateral type.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we originate most of our loans internally in both the Puerto Rico and mainland United
States markets, we occasionally purchase or participate in loans originated by other financial
institutions. When we purchase or participate in loans originated by others, we conduct the same
underwriting analysis of the borrowers and apply the same criteria as we do for loans originated by
us. This also includes a review of the applicable legal documentation. As December&nbsp;31, 2010, loans
originated internally accounted for 91% and 97%, respectively, of our loan portfolio for Puerto
Rico and the United States mainland.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set
forth below are the general parameters under which we analyze our major loan categories:</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Commercial and Construction</U>: Commercial and construction loans are underwritten using
a comprehensive analysis of the borrower&#146;s operations, including the borrower&#146;s business model,
management, financial statements, pro-forma financial condition including financial projections,
use of funds, debt service capacity, leverage and the financial strength of any guarantor. Most of
our commercial and construction loans are secured by real estate and other collateral. A review of
the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party appraisals of machinery and
equipment and commercial real estate, as appropriate, is also conducted. Physical inspection of
the collateral and audits of receivables is conducted when appropriate. Our credit policies
provide maximum loan-to-value ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the
value of the real estate collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value percentage varies by the
type of collateral. Our loan-to-value limitations are, in certain cases, determined by other risk
factors such as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor, the equity provided to the
project and the viability of the project itself. Most CRE loans are originated with full recourse
or limited recourse to all principals and owners. Non-recourse lending is limited to borrowers
with very solid financial capacity.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, $4.0&nbsp;billion, or
34%, of our total commercial and construction loans
in Puerto Rico were secured by real estate, while in the United States mainland, these figures
totaled $3.5&nbsp;billion, or 29%, respectively.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Consumer, Mortgage and Lease Financings</U>: Our consumer, mortgage and lease financings
are originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above, but also include an
assessment of each borrower&#146;s personal financial condition, including verification of income,
assets and FICO score. Credit reports are obtained and reconciled with the financial statements
provided to us. Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime
mortgage loans) does not exist, we generally define subprime loans as loans to borrowers with FICO
scores below 660, but we also include in subprime loans certain portfolios, such as the U.S.
non-conventional mortgage loan portfolio, due to other characteristics regardless of FICO scores.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2010, there was a reduced amount of
interest-only loans in our consumer loans portfolio and $117.8&nbsp;million of interest-only loans in our mortgage loan portfolio, all of which were at BPPR.
Also, we did not have any adjustable rate mortgage loans in our Puerto Rico portfolio. In Puerto
Rico, we offer a special step loan mortgage product to purchasers of units within construction
projects financed by BPPR. This product provides for 100% financing at a 2.99% interest rate for
the first five years of the term of the loan and 5.88% for the remaining term. This product also
has more flexible underwriting standards, including terms up to 40&nbsp;years, lower FICO scores and
higher debt to income ratios. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, Popular  had $261.5&nbsp;million of these
step loans.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2010, $3.7&nbsp;billion, or 45%, of our total consumer loans in Puerto Rico were
secured by real estate, as well as  mortage loans. While in the United
States mainland, these figures totaled $1.4&nbsp;billion, or
17%, respectively.  Lease financings are  also secured.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Loan extensions, renewals and restructurings</I></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans with satisfactory credit profiles can be extended, renewed or restructured. Many
commercial loan facilities are structured as lines of credit, which are mainly one year in term and
therefore are required to be renewed annually. Other facilities may be restructured or extended
from time to time based upon changes in the borrower&#146;s business needs, use of funds, timing of
completion of projects and other factors. If the borrower is not deemed to have financial
difficulties, extensions, renewals and restructurings are done in the normal course of business and
not considered concessions, and the loans continue to be recorded as performing.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We evaluate various factors in order to determine if a borrower is experiencing financial
difficulties. Indicators that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties include, for
example: (i)&nbsp;the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt; (ii)&nbsp;the borrower has
declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy; (iii)&nbsp;there is significant doubt as to
whether the borrower will continue to be a going concern; (iv)&nbsp;currently, the borrower has
securities that have been delisted, are in the process of being delisted, or are under threat of
being delisted from an exchange; and (v)&nbsp;based on estimates and projections that only encompass the
current business capabilities, the borrower forecasts that its entity-specific cash flows will be
insufficient to service the debt (both interest and principal) in accordance with the</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">contractual terms of the existing agreement through maturity; and absent the current
modification, the borrower cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at an
effective interest rate equal to the current market interest rate for similar debt for a
nontroubled debtor.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans to borrowers with financial difficulties can be modified as a loss mitigation
alternative. New terms and conditions of these loans are individually evaluated to determine a
feasible loan restructuring. In many consumer and mortgage loans, a trial period is established
where the borrower has to comply with three consecutive monthly payments under the new terms before
implementing the new structure. Loans that are restructured, renewed or extended due to financial
difficulties and the terms reflect concessions that would not otherwise be granted are considered
as Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#147;TDRs&#148;). These concessions could include a reduction in the
interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other
actions intended to maximize collection. These concessions stem from an agreement between the
creditor and the debtor or are imposed by law or a court.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans classified as TDRs are reported in non-accrual status if the loan was in non-accruing
status at the time of the modification. The TDR loan will continue in non-accrual status until the
borrower has demonstrated a willingness and ability to make the restructured loan payments (at
least six months of sustained performance after classified as TDR). Loans classified as TDRs are
excluded from TDR status if performance under the restructured terms exists for a reasonable period
(at least twelve months of sustained performance after classified) and the loan yields a market
rate.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a summary of our policy for placing loans on non-accrual status, refer to &#147;Critical
Accounting Policies / Estimates&#148; in the &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations&#148; section of the Annual Report. Credit risk management and

Condition and Results of Operations&#148; section of the Annual Report under &#147;Credit Risk Management and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Business Concentration</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our business activities are currently concentrated primarily in Puerto Rico, our results
of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico
economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. The concentration
of our operations in Puerto Rico exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a
wider geographic base. Our asset and revenue composition by geographical area is presented in
&#147;Financial Information about Geographic Areas&#148; below and in Note 39, &#147;Segment Reporting&#148;, to the
consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
loan portfolio is diversified by loan category. However,
approximately 58% of our
non-covered loan portfolio at December&nbsp;31, 2010 consisted of real estate-related loans, including
residential mortgage loans, construction loans and commercial loans secured by commercial real
estate. The table below presents the distribution of our non-covered loan portfolio by loan

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Federal Assistance</I>.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, we were affected by the broad economic slowdown in the United States and the
acceleration of the economic recession in Puerto Rico, our principal market, where the economy had
entered into recession in the second quarter of 2006. Weaknesses in the real estate sector, a
reduction of business activity in general and rising unemployment levels were leading to higher
delinquencies, charge-offs and allowance for loan losses that adversely impacted our earnings. The
economic downturn, coupled with an unprecedented crisis in the financial sector, in particular by
lack of market confidence in well-known financial institutions, severely hindered the ability of
financial institutions to raise financing and led to significant market instability and system-wide
stress. These conditions led the U.S. Federal government to establish the Capital Purchase Program
under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (&#147;TARP&#148;).</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our deteriorating financial condition and unprecedented market instability, we
considered it prudent to participate in the TARP Capital Purchase Program in order to strengthen
our capital and liquidity position. In December&nbsp;2008, we received $935&nbsp;million from the U.S.
Department of the Treasury (&#147;U.S. Treasury&#148;) as part of the TARP Capital Purchase Program in
exchange for senior perpetual preferred stock and a warrant to purchase 20,932,836 shares of our
Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.70 per share. The shares of preferred stock qualified as
Tier 1 regulatory capital and paid cumulative dividends quarterly at a rate of 5% per annum for the
first five years, and 9% per annum thereafter. The warrant was immediately exercisable, subject to
certain restrictions, and has a 10-year term. The exercise price and number of shares subject to
the warrant are both subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The U.S. Treasury may not exercise
voting power with respect to shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the warrant. Our
participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program made us subject to certain of the executive
compensation limitations included in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (&#147;EESA&#148;).</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TARP Capital Purchase Program gave us the opportunity to raise capital quickly and improve
our liquidity position, at low cost, with limited shareholder dilution, at a time when the
unprecedented market instability made it difficult, if not impossible, for us to raise capital. We
have used proceeds from the TARP, together with other available moneys, to make capital
contributions and loans to our banking subsidiaries to ensure they remain well-capitalized, and
strengthen their ability to continue creditworthy lending in our home markets.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Exchange Offer</I>.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first quarter of 2009, in light of the continued stressful financial conditions and
the severely constrained ability of bank holding companies to raise additional capital in the
markets, the U.S. Treasury, as part of the U.S. Government&#146;s Financial Stability Plan, announced
preliminary details of its Capital Assistance Program, or the &#147;CAP.&#148; To implement the CAP, the
Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Banks, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency commenced a review, referred to as the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (the
&#147;SCAP&#148;), of the capital of the 19 largest U.S. banking institutions. We were not included in the
group of 19 banking institutions reviewed under the SCAP. On May&nbsp;7, 2009, Federal banking
regulators announced the results of the SCAP and determined that 10 of the 19 banking institutions
were required to raise additional capital and to submit a capital plan to their Federal banking
regulators by June&nbsp;8, 2009 for their review.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though we were not one of the banking institutions included in the SCAP, we closely
assessed the announced SCAP results, particularly noting that (1)&nbsp;the SCAP credit loss assumptions
applied to regional banking institutions included in the SCAP were based on a more adverse economic
and credit scenario and (2)&nbsp;Federal banking regulators were focused on the composition of
regulatory capital. Specifically, the regulators indicated that voting common equity should be the
dominant element of Tier 1 capital and established a 4% Tier 1 common/risk-weighted assets ratio as
a threshold for determining capital needs. Although the SCAP results were not applicable to us,
they expressed general regulatory expectations.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we had been well capitalized based on a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets,
we believed that an improvement in the composition of our regulatory capital, including Tier 1
common equity, would better position us in a more adverse economic and credit</DIV>

common equity capital to accommodate the more adverse economic and credit scenarios assumed under
the SCAP as applied to regional banking institutions. With the exchange offer we issued 357.5
million new shares of Common Stock and increased our Tier 1 common equity by $1.4&nbsp;billion. For

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the public exchange offer, we agreed with the U.S. Treasury to exchange the
$935&nbsp;million senior preferred stock issued to them pursuant to the TARP Capital Purchase Program
for $935&nbsp;million of newly issued perpetual trust preferred securities, with the same distribution
rate as that of the preferred stock. On August&nbsp;24, 2009, we completed this exchange with the U.S.
Treasury. The trust preferred securities have a distribution rate of 5% until December&nbsp;5, 2013 and
9% thereafter. The warrant initially issued to the U.S Treasury in connection with the issuance of
the preferred stock in December&nbsp;2008 remained outstanding without amendment and currently

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to our participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program and the completion of
the exchange offer, during 2008 and 2009, we carried out a series of actions designed to improve
our U.S. operations, address credit quality, contain controllable costs, maintain well-capitalized
ratios and improve capital and liquidity positions.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, we carried out various restructurings plans for our operations in the U.S.
mainland. The principal objectives of these plans were to discontinue the operations of Popular
Financial Holdings, Inc. (&#147;PFH&#148;), the former holding company of Equity One, and to establish a
leaner, more efficient U.S. business model at BPNA and E-LOAN, suited to present economic
conditions, improving profitability in the short-term, increasing liquidity, lowering credit costs,
and over time achieving a greater integration with corporate functions in Puerto Rico. As part of
this plan, in November&nbsp;2008 we completed the sale of approximately $1.2&nbsp;billion in loan and
servicing assets of PFH for a gross purchase price of approximately $730&nbsp;million in cash. The sale
resulted in a reduction of approximately $900&nbsp;million in loans and mortgage servicing assets,
providing Popular with more than $700&nbsp;million in additional liquidity and significantly reducing
Popular&#146;s U.S. subprime assets. The proceeds from the PFH asset sales were used for repayment of
debt.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also established a restructuring plan for BPNA, consisting of a number of initiatives
grouped into three work streams: (1)&nbsp;branch network actions, (2)&nbsp;balance sheet initiatives, and (3)
general expense reductions. As part of the branch network actions, BPNA reduced its number of
branches to 99 from 139. These branches were selected based on the fact that they ranked lowest
within BPNA&#146;s network in both current profitability and potential for growth. Branch actions were
distributed across all regions, including California, New Jersey/New York, Florida, Illinois and
Texas. The balance sheet initiatives aimed to significantly downsize or exit asset-generating
businesses that are not relationship-based and/or whose profitability was severely impacted by the
prevailing credit and economic conditions. As part of this initiative, BPNA exited certain
businesses including, among the principal ones, those related to the origination of
non-conventional mortgages, equipment lease financing, and construction financing. The Corporation
holds the existing related businesses portfolio in a run-off mode. Also, as part of the BPNA
restructuring plan, we downsized the following businesses: business banking, SBA lending, and
consumer/mortgage lending. The general expense reduction initiative was targeted to capture cost
savings in the support functions directly related with the reductions in the branch network and
lending businesses, as well as to identify additional opportunities to cut discretionary expenses,
such as professional fees, traveling and other expenses. The BPNA restructuring plan contemplated
greater integration with corporate functions in Puerto Rico. The restructuring of the U.S.
operations has resulted in a reduction of headcount from
approximately 2,301 full-time equivalents(&#147;FTEs&#148;) as of December
31, 2008 to 1,393 FTEs as of  December&nbsp;31, 2010.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we established a restructuring plan for E-LOAN. This plan involved E-LOAN ceasing
to operate as a direct lender, an event that occurred in late 2008. E-LOAN continues to market
deposit accounts under its name for the benefit of BPNA and offer loan customers the option of
being referred to a trusted consumer lending partner. As part of the E-LOAN restructuring plan,
all operational and support functions were transferred to BPNA, eliminating E-LOAN&#146;s workforce.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these plans were successfully completed at the end of 2009.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Restructuring in Puerto Rico.</I></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2009 and 2010, we have also carried out a series of actions to improve our Puerto Rico
operations, credit quality and profitability. During 2009, we implemented cost-cutting measures
such as the reduction in  hiring and pension plan freezes, and the
suspension of matching contributions to retirement plans. The total number of FTEs has gone from
6,244 as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, to 5,894 as of December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 5,743 as of December&nbsp;31, 2010
(excluding the 820 FTEs of Westernbank we had hired as of December&nbsp;31, 2010).</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. In Puerto Rico,
our primary market, the banking business is highly competitive with respect to originating loans,
acquiring deposits and providing other banking services. Most of our direct competition for our
products and services comes from commercial banks. The Puerto Rico market is dominated by locally
based</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">commercial
banks with assets between  $3&nbsp;million and $27&nbsp;billion as
of December 31, 2010, such as ourselves, and a
few large U.S. and foreign banks. On April&nbsp;30, 2010, the FDIC closed three commercial banks and
entered into loss-share purchase and assumption agreements with three other commercial banks with
operations in Puerto Rico, including us with respect to the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction,
providing for the acquisition of most of the assets and liabilities of the closed banks, including
the assumption of all of the non-brokered deposits. This development could result in some of our
competitors gaining greater resources, such as a broader range of products and services. As of
December 31, 2010, there were 11 commercial banks operating in Puerto Rico.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also compete with specialized players in the local financial industry that are not subject
to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those
competitors include brokerage houses, mortgage companies, insurance companies, credit unions
(locally known as &#147;cooperativas&#148;), credit card companies, consumer finance companies, institutional
lenders and other financial and non-financial institutions and entities. Credit unions generally
provide basic consumer financial services. Some of these competitors are significantly larger than
us and have lower cost structures and many have fewer regulatory constraints.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, our competition is primarily from community banks operating in our
footprint together with the national banking institutions. These include institutions with much
more resources than we have that can exert substantial competitive pressure.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both Puerto Rico and the United States, the primary factors in competing for business
include pricing, convenience of office locations and other delivery methods, range of products
offered, and the level of service delivered. We must compete effectively along all these
parameters to be successful. We may experience pricing pressure as some of our competitors seek to
increase market share by reducing prices. Competition is particularly acute in the market for
deposits, where pricing is very aggressive. Increased competition could require that we increase
the rates offered on deposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect our
profitability.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic factors, along with legislative and technological changes, will have an ongoing
impact on the competitive environment within the financial services industry. We work to
anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions whether it may be developing and marketing
innovative products and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our
products and services, cross-marketing, or providing personalized banking services. We strive to
distinguish ourselves from other community banks and financial services providers in our
market place by providing a high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to attract and
retain business. However, we can provide no assurance as to the effectiveness of these efforts on
our future business or results of operations, as to our continued ability to anticipate and adapt
to changing conditions, and as to sufficiently improving our services and/or banking products in
order to successfully compete in our primary service areas.</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we employed 8,277 FTEs. None of our employees is represented by a
collective bargaining group.</DIV>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our corporate structure consists of two reportable segments &#151; BPPR and BPNA. These
reportable segments pertain only to our continuing operations. A &#147;Corporate&#148; group has been
defined to support the reportable segments. As a result of the EVERTEC transaction, the operations
of EVERTEC, which were considered a reportable segment, as well as the merchant acquiring business
and TicketPop divisions that were part of the BPPR reportable segment, were reclassified under the
Corporate Group. We retrospectively adjusted the information for all prior periods to conform to
the 2010 presentation.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management determined the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate
performance and to assess where to allocate resources. The segments were determined based on the
organizational structure, which focuses primarily on the markets the segments serve, as well as on
the products and services offered by the segments.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
further information about our segments, see &#147;Reportable Segment
Results&#148; on page 36 of the
Annual Report and Note 39, &#147;Segment Reporting&#148; to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenue
 composition by geographical area is presented in Note 39, &#147;Segment Reporting&#148; to the consolidated
financial statements included in the Annual Report.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table presents our long-lived assets by geographical area, other than financial
instruments, long-term customer relationships, mortgage and other servicing rights and deferred tax
assets. Long-lived assets located in foreign countries represent the investments under the equity
method in the Dominican Republic and El Salvador and other long-lived assets located in Venezuela
(for 2008 and 2009 also includes other long-lived assets located in Costa Rica and the Dominican
Republic). The increase in long-lived assets of Puerto Rico was mainly the result of the 49%
equity investment in EVERTEC, as described under the caption &#147;Sale of
EVERTEC&#148;.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to
Popular, PIB, PNA and their respective subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be
complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and
regulations described.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
 July&nbsp;21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act implements a variety of
far-reaching changes and has been called the most sweeping reform of the financial services
industry since the 1930&#146;s. A few provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are effective immediately, with
various provisions becoming effective in stages. Many of the provisions require governmental
agencies to implement rules within 18&nbsp;months of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. These rules
will increase regulation of the financial services industry and impose restrictions on the ability
of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices. These rules
will, for example, restrict the ability of financial institutions to charge certain banking and
other fees, allow interest to be paid on demand deposits, impose new restrictions on lending
practices and require depository institution holding companies to maintain capital levels at not
less than the levels required for insured depository institutions. We cannot predict the substance
or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation. Compliance with such legislation or
regulation may, among other effects, significantly increase our costs, limit our product offerings
and/or operating flexibility, require significant adjustments in our internal business processes,
and/or require us to maintain our regulatory capital at levels above historical practices.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular, PIB and PNA are bank holding companies subject to consolidated supervision and
regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. Under the BHC Act, the activities of
bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries have been limited to the business of
banking and activities closely related to banking, and no bank holding company could directly or
indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares or
substantially all of the assets of any company in the United States, including a bank, without the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, bank holding companies generally have
been prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in non-banking activities, unless such activities
were found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking. Popular, PIB and PNA
have elected to be treated as financial holding companies under the BHC Act. Bank holding
companies that qualify as &#147;financial holding companies&#148; may engage in a broader range of
non-banking activities, subject to certain conditions. BPPR and BPNA are subject to supervision
and examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies including, in the case of BPPR,
the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Commissioner of

Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (the &#147;Office of the
Commissioner&#148;), and in the case of BPNA, the Federal Reserve Board and the
New York State Banking Department.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes heightened prudential requirements on &#147;systemically
significant institutions,&#148; currently defined to include, among others, all bank holding companies
with at least $50&nbsp;billion in total consolidated assets. The heightened prudential standards
include more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and risk-management requirements
than those applied to other bank holding companies. In addition, covered bank holding companies
must prepare and file resolution plans (so-called &#147;living wills&#148;) and credit exposure reports and
limit their aggregate credit exposures (broadly defined) to any unaffiliated company to 25&nbsp;percent
of the capital stock and surplus. The Federal Reserve Board and the Financial Stability Oversight

assets greater than $50&nbsp;billion (regardless whether such bank holding companies have elected to be
treated as financial holding companies) must provide prior written notice to the Federal Reserve
Board before acquiring certain financial companies with assets in excess of $10&nbsp;billion. In
addition, effective on July&nbsp;21, 2011 (the &#147;Transfer Date&#148;), Section&nbsp;604 of the Dodd-Frank Act adds
a new application requirement before a financial holding company (regardless of its size) may
acquire a nonbank company with $10&nbsp;billion or more in total consolidated assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Prompt Corrective Action</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDIA&#148;) requires, among other things, the federal
banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of insured depository institutions
that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital tiers: &#147;well
capitalized&#148;, &#147;adequately capitalized&#148;, &#147;undercapitalized&#148;, &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;, and
&#147;critically undercapitalized&#148;. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital
ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies provide that an insured depository institution
will be deemed to be (1)&nbsp;well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and is
not subject to any written agreement or directive to meet a specific capital level; (2)&nbsp;adequately
capitalized, if it is not well capitalized, but maintains a leverage ratio of at least 4% (or at
least 3% if given the highest regulatory rating in its most recent report of examination and not
experiencing or anticipating significant growth), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4%
and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%; (3)&nbsp;undercapitalized if it fails to meet the
standards for adequately capitalized institutions (unless it is deemed significantly or critically
undercapitalized); (4)&nbsp;significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than 3%, a
Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than
6%; and (5)&nbsp;critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to 2% or less of total
assets.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital
distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company,
if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository
institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In
addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are
required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must
guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository
institution&#146;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital
deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may
not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on
realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital.
If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is
significantly undercapitalized.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of
requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become
adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits
from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to
appointment of a receiver or conservator.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to the FDIC-insured
depository institutions such as BPPR and BPNA, but they are not directly applicable to holding
companies such as Popular, PIB and PNA, which control such institutions. However, the Federal
Reserve Board has indicated that, in regulating bank holding companies, it may take appropriate
action at the holding company level based on its assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory
actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to such provisions and
regulations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;202(g) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Comptroller General to conduct a study of
the implementation of the prompt corrective action provisions by the federal banking agencies and
make recommendations to make them a more effective tool. The Comptroller General must submit a
report to the Financial Stability Oversight Council on the results of the study before July&nbsp;21,
2011. Within six months after receiving such report, the Financial Stability Oversight Council
must report to the Congressional Banking Committees on actions taken in response to the report,
including any recommendations made to the federal banking agencies.

Section&nbsp;23A) between BPPR or BPNA, on the one hand, and Popular, PIB, PNA or any of our other

20% of the bank&#146;s capital stock and surplus. In addition, Section&nbsp;23B of the Federal Reserve Act
requires that any transaction between BPPR or BPNA, on the one hand, and Popular, PIB, PNA or any of our other non-banking
subsidiaries, on the other, be carried out on an arm&#146;s length basis.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Source of Financial Strength</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s Regulation&nbsp;Y, a bank holding company such as Popular, PIB or
PNA is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to
commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when,
absent such policy, the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support. In addition,
any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository institutions are
subordinated in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary
depository institution. In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the
bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository
institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. BPPR
and BPNA are currently the only insured depository institution subsidiaries of Popular, PIB and
PNA.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;616 of the Dodd-Frank Act obligates the Federal Reserve Board to require bank holding
companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution.
The term &#147;source of financial strength&#148; is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial
assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at
such subsidiaries. The source-of-strength amendments in Section&nbsp;616 take effect on July&nbsp;21, 2011,
and the appropriate federal banking agencies must jointly adopt implementing regulations by that
date. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was no explicit authority in the BHC Act for the source
of strength provision in the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s Regulation&nbsp;Y.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Dividend Restrictions</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal sources of funding for the holding companies have included dividends received from
their banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of
medium-term notes, junior subordinated debentures and equity. Various statutory provisions limit
the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without
regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any
dividend, if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would
exceed the total of its net income (as reportable in its Report of Condition and Income) for that
year, combined with its retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the preceding two years,
less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In
addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided
profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the
approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its
permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve
Board. Subject to the Federal Reserve&#146;s ability to establish more stringent specific requirements
under its supervisory or enforcement authority, at December&nbsp;31, 2010, BPPR could have declared a
dividend of approximately $78&nbsp;million. BPNA could not declare any dividends without the approval of
the Federal Reserve Board.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends
on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only
if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#146;s current
and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, under
Federal Reserve Board policy, bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that place
undue pressure on the capital of depository institution subsidiaries or that may undermine the bank
holding company&#146;s ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. In the current
financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding
companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged dividend pay-out ratios
that are at the 100% or higher level unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.
Popular is also subject to dividend restrictions because of our participation in the TARP Capital
Purchase Program. For further information please refer to Part&nbsp;II, Item&nbsp;5, &#147;Market for
Registrant&#146;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#148;.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, subject to compliance with certain conditions,
distributions of U.S. sourced dividends to a corporation organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are subject to a withholding tax of 10% instead of the 30% applied to
other &#147;foreign&#148; corporations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BPPR and BPNA are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the &#147;Reform Act&#148;) created a single DIF,
increased the maximum amount of FDIC insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts, and
provided for possible &#147;inflation adjustments&#148; in the maximum amount of coverage available with
respect to other insured accounts. Under the Reform Act, the FDIC made significant changes to its

based upon a matrix that is designed to more closely tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to
the risks they pose.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EESA temporarily raised the basic limit
on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. Section&nbsp;335 of the
Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the $250,000 standard maximum limit for federal deposit insurance
and provides unlimited federal deposit insurance protection for non-interest bearing transaction
accounts that are payable on demand at insured depository institutions from December&nbsp;31, 2010,
until January&nbsp;1, 2013.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;334 of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the ceiling on the size of the DIF (1.5&nbsp;percent
of estimated insured deposits prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act). Section&nbsp;334 also
raises the statutorily required floor for the DIF from 1.15&nbsp;percent of estimated insured deposits
to 1.35&nbsp;percent of estimated insured deposits, or a comparable percentage of the revised assessment
base required by the Dodd-Frank Act, which is based on average total assets less average tangible
equity. Section&nbsp;334 requires the FDIC to take the steps necessary for the Deposit Insurance Fund
to meet this revised reserve ratio by September&nbsp;30, 2020.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;19, 2010, the FDIC adopted a new Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Restoration
Plan (the &#147;Restoration Plan&#148;) for the DIF to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by
September&nbsp;30, 2020, as required by Section&nbsp;334 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Restoration Plan,
the FDIC has foregone the uniform three-basis point increase in initial assessment rates previously
scheduled to take place on January&nbsp;1, 2011. On December&nbsp;14, 2010, the FDIC adopted a final rule,
which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2011, to set the DIF&#146;s designated reserve ratio at 2% of
estimated insured deposits.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As required by Sections&nbsp;331 and 332 of the Dodd-Frank Act, on February&nbsp;7, 2011, the FDIC
adopted a final rule relating to deposit insurance assessment base, assessment rate adjustments,
deposit insurance assessment rates, dividends, and large bank pricing methodology, which will
become effective on April&nbsp;1, 2011. According to the final rule, the assessment base for an
insured depository institution is the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository
institution minus the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period.
Currently (until April&nbsp;1, 2011), only deposits payable in the United States are included in
determining the premium paid by an institution. In addition, Section&nbsp;332 of the Dodd-Frank Act
continued the FDIC&#146;s authority to declare dividends when the DIF reserve ratio at the end of
calendar year is at least 1.5%, but granted the FDIC sole discretion in determining whether to
suspend or limit the declaration or payment of dividends. Pursuant to this authority, the final
rule suspends dividends indefinitely whenever the DIF reserve ratio exceeds 1.5% to increase the
probability that the DIF reserve ratio will reach a level sufficient to withstand a future crisis.
In lieu of dividends, the final rule adopts progressively lower assessment rate schedules when the
reserve ratio exceeds 2% and 2.5%.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 separated the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;)
assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the DIF assessment. The amount
assessed on individual institutions by the FICO is in addition to the amount paid for deposit
insurance according to the FDIC&#146;s risk-related assessment rate schedules. The FICO assessment rate
for the first quarter of 2011 was 1.02 cents per $100 of deposits.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FDIA governs the receipt of brokered deposits. Section&nbsp;29 of FDIA and the regulations adopted
thereunder restrict the use of brokered deposits and the rate of interest payable on deposits for
institutions that are less than well capitalized. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is
well capitalized. Popular does not believe the brokered deposits regulation has had or will have a
material effect on the funding or liquidity of BPPR and BPNA.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Capital Adequacy</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and
member banks, the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets (including
certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. In addition, the
Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies
and member banks. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets,
less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (the &#147;leverage ratio&#148;) of 3% for bank holding
companies and member banks that have the highest regulatory rating or have implemented the Federal
Reserve Board&#146;s market risk capital measure. All other bank holding companies and member banks are
required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. See Consolidated Financial Statements, Note
25 &#147;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#148; on pages 168 and 170 for the capital ratios of Popular, BPPR

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">companies. In effect, the Collins Amendment applies to bank holding
companies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that will apply to insured
depository institutions. Because the capital requirements must be the same for insured depository
institutions and their holding companies, the Collins Amendment will exclude trust preferred securities from
Tier 1 capital, subject to phase-out from Tier 1 qualification for trust preferred securities
issued before May&nbsp;19, 2010, with the phase-out commencing on January&nbsp;1, 2013 and to be implemented
&#147;incrementally&#148; over a three-year period commencing on that date. Prior to the Collins Amendment,
trust preferred securities (in addition to, among others, common equity, retained earnings,
minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries) can be included in Tier 1
capital for bank holding companies, provided that not more than 25% of qualifying Tier 1 capital
may consist of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, trust preferred securities or other
&#147;so-called&#148; restricted core capital elements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking organizations are expected to maintain at least 50&nbsp;percent of their Tier 1 capital as
common equity. In addition, effective October&nbsp;17, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board approved an
interim rule to allow the inclusion of the senior perpetual preferred stock issued to the U.S.
Treasury under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (&#147;TARP&#148;) Capital Purchase Program, without limit,
as Tier 1 capital. &#147;Tier 2 capital&#148; consists of, among other things, a limited amount of
subordinated debt, other preferred stock, certain other instruments and a limited amount of loan
and lease loss reserves.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December 31, 2010, Popular had $427 million in trust preferred
securities (capital securities) that are subject to the phase-out.
Popular has not issued any trust preferred securities since May 19,
2010. At December 31, 2010, the remaining trust preferred securities
corresponded to capital securities issued to the U.S. Treasury
pursuant to the EESA. The Collins Amendment includes an exemption
from the phase-out provision that applies to these capital securities
because they were issued prior to October 4, 2010.</div>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#147;Basel Committee&#148;) published a new
set of risk-based capital standards (&#147;Basel II&#148;) in order to update the original international
capital standards that had been put in place in 1988 (&#147;Basel I&#148;). A definitive final rule for
implementing the advanced approaches of Basel II in the United States, which applies only to
certain large or internationally active or &#147;core&#148; banking organizations (defined as those with
consolidated total assets of $250&nbsp;billion or more or consolidated on-balance sheet foreign
exposures of $10&nbsp;billion or more) became effective on April&nbsp;1, 2008. Other U.S. banking
organizations may elect to adopt the requirements of this rule (if they meet applicable
qualification requirements), but are not required to. The advanced approaches rules establish a
series of transitional floors to provide a smooth transition to the advanced approaches rules and
to limit temporarily the amount by which a banking organization&#146;s risk-based capital requirements
could decline relative to the general risk-based capital rules over a period of at least three
years following completion of a satisfactory parallel run.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As required by the Collins Amendment, on December&nbsp;14, 2010, the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking
relating to risk-based capital standards. In particular, the agencies proposed to revise the
advanced approaches rules by replacing the transitional floors in the advanced approaches rule with
a permanent floor equal to the Tier 1 and total risk-based capital requirements under the current
generally applicable risk-based capital rules.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervisors of the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee, released its final framework for
strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (&#147;Basel III&#148;). The implementation of
the Basel III final capital framework will commence January&nbsp;1, 2013. On that date, banks will be
required to meet the following minimum capital ratios: 3.5% common equity Tier 1 (&#147;CET1&#148;) to
risk-weighted assets; 4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and 8.0% total capital to
risk-weighted assets. When fully phased in on January&nbsp;1, 2019, banks will be required to maintain:
a minimum 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, plus a 2.5% &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; (which is
added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio
of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%); a minimum 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
assets, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as
that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%); and a
minimum 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is
added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a
minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%); a minimum leverage ratio of 3%; and a &#147;countercyclical
capital buffer,&#148; generally to be imposed when regulators determine that excess aggregate credit
growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk, that would be a CET1 add-on to the
capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented (potentially
resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basel III final capital framework provides for a number of new deductions from and
adjustments to CET1, the implementation of which will begin on January&nbsp;1, 2014 and will be
phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the capital conservation
buffer will begin on January&nbsp;1, 2016 at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing
by that amount on each subsequent January&nbsp;1, until it reaches 2.5% on January&nbsp;1, 2019).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basel III final liquidity framework requires banks to comply with two measures of
liquidity risk exposure: the &#147;Liquidity Coverage Ratio,&#148; or &#147;LCR&#148;, based on a 30-day time horizon
and calculated as the ratio of the &#147;stock of high-quality liquid assets&#148; divided by &#147;total net cash
outflows over the next 30 calendar days&#148;, which must be at least 100%; and the &#147;Net Stable Funding
Ratio,&#148; or &#147;NSFR,&#148; calculated as the ratio of the &#147;available amount of stable funding&#148; divided by
the &#147;required amount of stable funding,&#148; which must be at least 100%. Although the Basel Committee
has not asked for additional comment on the LCR and NSFR, both are subject to observation periods
and transitional arrangements, with the Basel III liquidity framework providing that revisions to
the LCR will be made by mid-2013, and the LCR will be introduced as a requirement on January&nbsp;1,
2015; and revisions to the NSFR will be made by mid-2016, and the NSFR will be introduced as a
requirement on January&nbsp;1, 2018.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on us cannot be determined at
this time and will depend on a number of factors, including the treatment and implementation by the
U.S. banking regulators. However, a requirement that Popular and our depository institution
subsidiaries maintain more capital, with common equity as a more predominant component, or manage the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;613 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
Efficiency Act of 1994 (the &#147;Interstate Banking Act&#148;) to authorize national banks and state banks
to branch interstate through de novo branches. This section became effective on July&nbsp;22, 2010.
Prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Interstate Banking Act provided that states may
make an &#147;opt-in&#148; election to permit interstate branching through de novo branches. A majority of
states did not opt-in. Section&nbsp;613 of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated such required &#147;opt-in&#148;
election. For purposes of the Interstate Banking Act, BPPR is treated as a state bank and is
subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allows bank holding companies whose subsidiary depository
institutions meet management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a
substantially broader range of nonbanking financial activities than is permissible for bank holding
companies that fail to meet those standards, including securities underwriting and dealing,
insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in nonfinancial companies. In order
for a bank holding company to engage in the broader range of activities that are permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (i)&nbsp;all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized
(as described above), and well managed and (ii)&nbsp;it must file a declaration with the Federal Reserve
Board that it elects to be a &#147;financial holding company.&#148; In addition, Section&nbsp;606 of the
Dodd-Frank Act requires that a bank holding company that is a financial holding company and
therefore may engage in the expanded financial activities authorized by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
be and remain well-capitalized and well managed. Popular, PIB and PNA have elected to be treated
as financial holding companies. A depository institution is deemed to be &#147;well managed&#148; if at its
most recent inspection, examination or subsequent review by the appropriate federal banking agency
(or the appropriate state banking agency), the depository institution received at least a
&#147;satisfactory&#148; composite rating and at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating for management. If, after
becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding
company that is not a financial holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the
capital or managerial requirements for financial holding company status, the company must enter
into a confidential agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to comply with all applicable capital
and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180&nbsp;days, the
Federal Reserve Board may extend the agreement or may order the company to divest its subsidiary
banks or the company may discontinue, or divest investments in companies engaged in, activities
permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding
company.

been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the
&#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;) strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to help prevent, detect and
prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Title III of the USA
PATRIOT Act imposed significant compliance and due diligence obligations, created new crimes and
penalties and expanded the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Failure of a
financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act&#146;s requirements could have serious legal
and reputational consequences for the institution.

statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a
transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the costs of fraud prevention. On December
28, 2010, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking establishing, among
other things, standards for assessing whether the amount of an interchange fee charged by a payment
card issuer or network is reasonable and proportional to the actual cost incurred by the issuer or
network with respect to an electronic debit transaction and for making adjustments to such fees to
take into account the costs of fraud prevention.

The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however,
they contain one or more of the following elements: (i)&nbsp;restrictions on trade with or investment
in a sanctioned country; and (ii)&nbsp;a blocking of assets in which the government or specially
designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of
property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S.
persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off
or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a commercial bank organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, BPPR is subject to supervision,
examination and regulation by the Office of the Commissioner, pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking
Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Banking Law&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the yearly net income of
BPPR be credited annually to a reserve fund. This apportionment must be done every year until the
reserve fund is equal to the total of paid-in capital on common and preferred stock. During 2010,
BPPR was in compliance with the statutory reserve requirement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of a bank are
greater than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the
undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve
fund. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the
outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared
until capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original
capital.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve that, except as
otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less than 20% of its demand
liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by
collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a state of the United
States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that
state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the
reserve requirements of Section&nbsp;16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated
November&nbsp;24, 1982, BPPR has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve
System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, BPPR is subject to the reserve
requirements prescribed by the Banking Law.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to any one person, firm,
partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of fifteen percent (15%) of the paid-in
capital and reserve fund of the bank. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, the legal lending limit for the Bank
under this provision was approximately $212.5&nbsp;million. In the case of loans which are secured by
collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the maximum aggregate amount is
increased to one third of the paid-in capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the
institution is well capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the
Office of the Commissioner or any regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15%
of 50% of its undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than
the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided
profits. Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional
component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the
Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section&nbsp;17 on the amount of loans that are wholly
secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United
States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or
instrumentalities of Puerto Rico.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;14 of the Banking Law authorizes a bank to conduct certain financial and related
activities directly or through subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal property and
originating and servicing mortgage loans. BPPR engages in these activities through its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Popular Auto, Inc. and Popular Mortgage, Inc., respectively. Both companies are
organized and operate in Puerto Rico.

June&nbsp;30, 2010. According to the Puerto Rico Planning Board, the real gross national product is
expected to increase by 0.4% for the fiscal year ending June&nbsp;30,
2011. This figure may be revised before the conclusion of the fiscal
year.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government is currently addressing a fiscal deficit which in
its initial stages was estimated at approximately $3.2&nbsp;billion or over 30% of its annual budget. It
is implementing a multi-year budget plan for reducing the deficit, as its access to the municipal
bond market and its credit ratings depend, in part, on achieving a balanced budget. Some of the
measures implemented by the government include reducing expenses, including public-sector
employment through employee layoffs. Since the government is an
important source of employment in Puerto Rico, these measures could have the effect of intensifying the current recessionary cycle.
The Puerto Rico Labor Department reported an unemployment rate of
14.7% for December 2010, down from 15.4% in November, but slightly
higher than 14.3% in December 2009. The economy
of Puerto Rico is very sensitive to the price of oil in the global
market. Puerto Rico does not have
significant mass transit available to the public and most of its electricity is powered by oil,
making it highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. A substantial increase in its price could
impact adversely the economy by reducing disposable income and increasing the operating costs of
most businesses and government. Consumer spending is particularly sensitive to wide fluctuations in
oil prices.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decline in Puerto Rico&#146;s economy has resulted in, among other things, a downturn in our
loan originations, an increase in the level of our non-performing assets, loan loss provisions and
charge-offs, particularly in our construction and commercial loan portfolios, an increase in the
rate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans, and a reduction in the value of our loans and loan

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current state of the economy and uncertainty in the private and public sectors has had an
adverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios. The persistent economic slowdown is
expected to cause those adverse effects to continue, as delinquency rates may
increase in the short-term, until sustainable growth resumes. Also, a potential reduction in
consumer spending may also impact growth in our other interest and non-interest revenues.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our construction,
commercial and mortgage loan portfolios may result in increased credit losses. As of December&nbsp;31,
2010, approximately 2%, 34% and 22% of our non-covered  loan portfolio constituted of construction,
commercial secured by real estate and mortgage loans, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy.
Whether the collateral is located in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin
Islands or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value
backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific
real estate market. Recent economic reports related to the real estate market in Puerto Rico
indicate that certain pockets of the real estate market are subject to reductions in value related
to general economic conditions. In certain mainland markets like southern Florida, Illinois and
California, we have been seeing the negative impact associated with low absorption rates and
property value adjustments due to overbuilding. We measure the impairment based on the fair value
of the collateral, if collateral dependent, which is derived from estimated collateral values,
principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration prices in observed
transactions involving similar assets in similar locations, size and supply and demand. An
appraisal report is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is
made. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or
foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the
property. In addition, given the current slowdown in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, the
properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential real estate
properties entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are
larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and
are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. As of December&nbsp;31, 2010, commercial and
construction loans secured by commercial  real estate properties, excluding loans
covered under FDIC loss share agreements, amounted to
$7.5&nbsp;billion or 36% of the total loan
portfolio.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, net charge-offs specifically related to values of
properties securing our construction, commercial and mortgage loan
portfolios totaled $391.9
million, $259.6&nbsp;million and $87.5&nbsp;million respectively. Continued deterioration on the fair value
of real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired loans would require increases in
Popular&#146;s provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have an
adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information on
the credit quality of our construction, commercial and mortgage portfolio see the Credit Risk

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market instability and lack of investor confidence have led many lenders and institutional
investors to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers, including other financial

have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices or
violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion
and power would have a negative impact on Popular.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in
government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the
financial services industry. The U.S. Government has intervened on an unprecedented scale,
responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. Several funding and
capital programs by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury were launched in 2008 and 2009,
with the objective of enhancing financial institutions&#146; ability to raise liquidity. It is expected
that these programs may have the effect of increasing the degree or nature of regulatory
supervision to which we are subjected. These and other potential regulation and scrutiny mayor
proposed legislative and regulatory changes could significantly increase our costs, impede the
efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and,
limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner or otherwise adversely
affect our results of operations or earnings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny as a result of our participation in the
TARP. Unless we have redeemed all of the trust preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury or
the U.S. Treasury has transferred all of its trust preferred securities to third parties, the
consent of the U.S. Treasury will be required for us to, among other things, increase the dividend
rate per share of Common Stock above $0.08 per share or to repurchase or redeem equity securities,
including our Common Stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. Popular has also granted
registration rights and offering facilitation rights to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to which we have
agreed to lock-up periods during which it would be unable to issue equity securities. Our
participation in TARP also imposes limitations on the payments we may make to our senior leaders.
For more details on the implications of TARP please refer to the risks factors titled as follow:
<I>Our business could suffer if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate skilled senior leaders</I>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, which significantly changes the
regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act
includes, and the regulations to be developed thereunder will include, provisions affecting large
and small financial institutions alike including several provisions that will affect how community
banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated in the future.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes new capital requirements on bank holding
companies; changes the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank&#146;s average consolidated total
assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base, and permanently raises the
current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expands the FDIC&#146;s authority to raise
insurance premiums. The legislation also calls for the FDIC to raise the ratio of reserves to
deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September&nbsp;30, 2020 and to &#147;offset
the effect&#148; of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than
$10&nbsp;billion. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions,
establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection as an independent entity within the Federal
Reserve, which will have broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer
financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity
loans and credit cards, and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering
incentives, determinations as to a borrower&#146;s ability to repay and prepayment penalties. The
Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation
at all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business
checking accounts. The legislation also restricts proprietary trading, places restrictions on the
owning or sponsoring of hedge and private equity funds, and regulates the derivatives activities of
banks and their affiliates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Collins Amendment (Section&nbsp;171 of the Dodd-Frank Act), which became effective on July&nbsp;22,
2010, will have a significant impact on current capital requirements for bank holding companies
such as Popular, because it requires the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and
risk-based capital requirements that apply on a consolidated basis for insured depository
institutions and their holding companies. In effect, the Collins Amendment applies to bank holding
companies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that will apply to insured
depository institutions. Because the capital requirements must be the same for insured depository
institutions and their holding companies, the Collins Amendment will exclude trust preferred
securities from Tier 1 Capital, subject to phase-out from Tier 1 qualification for trust preferred
securities issued before May&nbsp;19, 2010, with the phase-out commencing on January&nbsp;1, 2013 and to be
implemented &#147;incrementally&#148; over a three-year period commencing on that date. Debt or equity
instruments issued to the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof prior to October
10, 2010, pursuant to the EESA, are exempted from the
requirements of the Collins Amendment. Prior to the Collins Amendment, trust preferred securities
(in addition to, among others, common equity, retained earnings, minority interests in equity
accounts of consolidated subsidiaries) can be included in Tier 1 capital for bank holding
companies, provided that not more than 25% of qualifying Tier 1 capital may consist of
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, trust preferred securities or other so-called restricted
core capital elements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions, or any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative
changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact the
profitability of our business activities or change certain of our business practices, including the
ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve
satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased
compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and
resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our
management is actively reviewing the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, many of which are to be
phased-in over the next several months and years, and assessing its probable impact on our
operations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry
in general, and us in particular, is uncertain at this time.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A separate legislative proposal would impose a new fee or tax on U.S. financial institutions
as part of the 2010 budget plans in an effort to reduce the anticipated budget deficit and to
recoup losses anticipated from the TARP. Such an assessment is estimated to be 15-basis points,
levied against bank assets minus Tier 1 capital and domestic deposits. The administration has also
considered a transaction tax on trades of stock in financial institutions and a tax on executive
bonuses.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Congress has also recently adopted additional consumer protection laws such as the
Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, and the Federal Reserve has
adopted numerous new regulations addressing banks&#146; credit card, overdraft and mortgage lending
practices. Additional consumer protection legislation and regulatory activity is anticipated in the
near future.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervisors of the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee, released its final framework for
strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (&#147;Basel III&#148;). The implementation of
the Basel III final capital framework will commence January&nbsp;1, 2013. On that date, banks will be
required to meet the following minimum capital ratios: 3.5% common equity Tier 1 (&#147;CET1&#148;) to
risk-weighted assets; 4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; and 8.0% total capital to
risk-weighted assets. When fully phased in on January&nbsp;1, 2019, banks will be required to maintain:
a minimum 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, plus a 2.5% &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; (which is
added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio
of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%); a minimum 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted
assets, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as
that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%); and a
minimum 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is
added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a
minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%); a minimum leverage ratio of 3%; and a &#147;countercyclical
capital buffer,&#148; generally to be imposed when regulators determine that excess aggregate credit
growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk, that would be a CET1 add-on to the
capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented (potentially
resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basel III final capital framework provides for a number of new deductions from and
adjustments to CET1, the implementation of which will begin on January&nbsp;1, 2014 and will be
phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year). The implementation of the capital conservation
buffer will begin on January&nbsp;1, 2016 at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing
by that amount on each subsequent January&nbsp;1, until it reaches 2.5% on January&nbsp;1, 2019).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basel III final liquidity framework requires banks to comply with two measures of
liquidity risk exposure: the &#147;Liquidity Coverage Ratio,&#148; or &#147;LCR&#148;, based on a 30-day time horizon
and calculated as the ratio of the &#147;stock of high-quality liquid assets&#148; divided by &#147;total net cash
outflows over the next 30 calendar days&#148;, which must be at least 100%; and the &#147;Net Stable Funding
Ratio,&#148; or &#147;NSFR,&#148; calculated as the ratio of the &#147;available amount of stable funding&#148; divided by
the &#147;required amount of stable funding,&#148; which must be at least 100%. Although the Basel Committee
has not asked for additional comment on the LCR and NSFR, both are subject to observation periods
and transitional arrangements, with the Basel III liquidity framework providing that revisions to
the LCR will be made by mid-2013, and the LCR will be introduced as a requirement on January&nbsp;1,
2015; and revisions to the NSFR will be made by mid-2016, and the NSFR will be introduced as a
requirement on January&nbsp;1, 2018.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,
counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and
counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services
industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge
funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the
event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated
when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to
recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurance
that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or
earnings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. We
request collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitor these on
a regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by us
and results in losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when market
confidence is affected by events related to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion among
participants may increase, substantially and makes it more difficult to borrow in the credit
markets. Our credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009, and our senior unsecured ratings
are now &#147;non-investment grade&#148; with the three major rating agencies. This may make it more
difficult for Popular to borrow in the capital markets and at a higher cost. Nonetheless, our
senior debt ratings were raised by Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s in May, 2010 to &#147;B&#148; with a positive outlook,
from its previous level of &#147;B-&#148;. In February of 2011, Fitch raised our senior debt rating to &#147;B&#043;&#148;
with a stable outlook, from its previous level of &#147;B&#148;.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the
loans originated or acquired. We establish provisions for loan losses, which lead to reductions in
the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which is
deemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in
accordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to our
financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the
future, including forecasts of economic and market conditions that might impair the ability of our
borrowers to repay the loans. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated
the level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to increase the provision for loan
losses in the future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons
beyond our control. Any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any loan losses in
excess of our provisions for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial
condition and result of operations. We will continue to evaluate our provision for loan losses and
allowance for loan losses and may be required to increase such amounts.

loans to the Government and our portfolio of Puerto Rico Government securities.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Puerto Rico&#146;s economy is closely integrated to that of the U.S. mainland and its
government and many of its instrumentalities are investment grade-rated borrowers in the U.S.
capital markets, the fiscal situation of the Government of Puerto Rico led nationally recognized
rating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the fiscal challenges that were being faced, the rating agencies in 2006
downgraded the debt ratings of the Commonwealth, maintaining them at investment grade.
Subsequently, as a result of the progress made in balancing the budget under a multi-year plan,
there have been upward revisions in the credit ratings. As part of a recalibration of its rating
system for municipal obligations, Moody&#146;s raised the Commonwealth&#146;s credit ratings in April 2010
to A3 with a stable outlook, and in August&nbsp;2010 revised the ratings outlook to negative. S&#038;P&#146;s
rating of BBB remained unchanged but the outlook was improved to positive in November&nbsp;2010. While
Moody&#146;s &#147;A3&#148; rating and S&#038;P&#146;s &#147;BBB&#148; take into consideration Puerto Rico&#146;s fiscal challenges, other
factors could trigger an outlook change, such as the inability to successfully complete the
implementation of the multiyear fiscal plan to bring the Central Government&#146;s budget back into
balance, pursuant to Act No.&nbsp;7 of the Commonwealth of P.R.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January 19, 2011, Fitch Ratings assigned a &#145;BBB&#043;&#146;
rating to the outstanding general obligation (GO) bonds of the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico with a &#145;stable&#146; outlook.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors such as the government&#146;s ability to implement meaningful steps to control operating
expenditures and maintain the integrity of the tax base will be key determinants of future ratings
stability. Also, the inability to agree on future fiscal year Commonwealth budgets could result in
ratings pressure from the rating agencies.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgrade
in Puerto Rico&#146;s debt obligations. However, deterioration in the fiscal situation with possible
negative ratings implications, could adversely affect the value of Puerto Rico&#146;s Government
obligations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had $1.4&nbsp;billion of credit facilities granted to or guaranteed by the
Puerto Rico Government and its political subdivisions, of which $199&nbsp;million were uncommitted
lines of credit. Of these total credit facilities granted, $1.1&nbsp;billion were outstanding at
December&nbsp;31, 2010. A substantial portion of our credit exposure to the Government of Puerto Rico is
either collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues
identified for its repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans to
public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as water
and electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from the
Central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from it. We also have loans to
various municipalities for which the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the
applicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment. These municipalities are required by
law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all of
its general obligation bonds and loans. Another portion of these loans consists of special
obligations of various municipalities that are payable from the basic real and personal property
taxes collected within such municipalities. The good faith and credit obligations of the
municipalities have a first lien on the basic property taxes.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as of December&nbsp;31, 2010, we had outstanding $144.7&nbsp;million in Obligations of
Puerto Rico, States and Political Subdivisions as part of our investment portfolio. Of that total,
$140&nbsp;million was exposed to the creditworthiness of the Puerto Rico Government and its
municipalities. We continue to closely monitor the political and economic situation of Puerto Rico
and evaluate the portfolio for any declines in value that management may consider being
other-than-temporary.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>We are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject
to recourse arrangements.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until
the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. In the past, we have
retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we
also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, we serviced
$4.0&nbsp;billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans
associated with FNMA and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to
the credit recourse provided, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third party
investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be
required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is
equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with
recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2010, we repurchased
approximately $121&nbsp;million in
mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformance by the
borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December
31, 2010, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans
sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $53.7&nbsp;million. We may suffer losses on these loans
when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are
less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and
the costs of holding and disposing of the related property.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of
customary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized.

may impact our ability to obtain third-party financing for the loan, and be unsaleable or saleable
only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be
obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to
indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for
operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans
are originated in accordance with the secondary market&#146;s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or
certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize repurchases
and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such
loans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resulting
from representation and warranty violations on specific portfolios. At
December 31, 2010, Popular&#146;s reserve for estimated losses from
representation and warranty arrangements amounted to $40.9 million,
which was included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated
statement of condition. Nonetheless, we do not expect
any such losses to be significant, although if they were to occur, they would adversely impact our
results of operations or financial condition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008 and continuing in 2009, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased
resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the DIF. In addition, the FDIC instituted two temporary
programs, to further insure customer deposits at FDIC-member banks: deposit accounts are now insured up to $250,000 per customer (up from $100,000) and
non-interest-bearing transaction accounts are fully insured (unlimited coverage) as a result of our
participation in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program. These
programs have placed additional stress on the DIF.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the DIF, the FDIC
increased assessment rates of insured institutions uniformly by 7 cents for every $100 of deposits
beginning with the first quarter of 2009, with additional changes in April&nbsp;1, 2009, which required
riskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on,
among other things, secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels. In May&nbsp;2009, the FDIC adopted a
final rule, effective June&nbsp;30, 2009, that imposed a special assessment of 5 cents for every $100 on
each insured depository institution&#146;s assets minus its Tier 1 Capital as of June&nbsp;30, 2009, subject
to a cap equal to 10 cents per $100 of assessable deposits for the second quarter 2009 risk-based
capital assessment. This special assessment applied to us and resulted in a $16.7&nbsp;million expense
in our second quarter of 2009. On November&nbsp;12, 2009, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring banks to
prepay three years&#146; worth of premiums to replenish its depleted insurance fund. In December&nbsp;30,
2009, Popular prepaid $221&nbsp;million and reduced our year-end liquidity at our banking subsidiaries.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, major changes were introduced to the FDIC deposit
insurance system. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC now has until the end of September&nbsp;2020 to
bring its reserve ratio to the new statutory minimum of 1.35%. New rules amending the deposit
insurance assessment regulations under the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted,
including a final rule designating 2% as the designated reserve ratio and a final rule extending
temporary unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest bearing transaction accounts maintained in
connection with lawyers&#146; trust accounts. On February&nbsp;7, 2011, the FDIC adopted regulations
effective for the 2011 second quarter assessment and payable in September&nbsp;2011, which outline
significant changes in the risk-based premiums approach for banks with over $10&nbsp;billion of assets
and creates a &#147;Scorecard&#148; system. The &#147;Scorecard&#148; system uses a performance score and loss severity
score, which aggregate to an initial base assessment rate. The assessment base also changes from
deposits to an institution&#146;s average total assets minus its average tangible equity. We are
currently evaluating the effect of these new regulations on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC
insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or our capital position
is further impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently
increased levels. Our expenses for 2010 were significantly and adversely affected by these
increased premiums. These announced increases and any future increases or special assessments may
materially adversely affect our results of operations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our
financial condition and future results of operations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2010 we had approximately $647.4&nbsp;million and $58.7&nbsp;million of goodwill and
amortizable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet related to our Puerto Rico and United
States operations, respectively. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired,
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under GAAP, we review our
amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors
that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the
goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future cash flow
estimates and slower growth rates in the industry.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with
regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these
estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn,
negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded.
Critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include:

valuation date, requiring the completion of Step 2. Step 2 required a valuation of all assets and
liabilities of the BPNA unit, including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets, to
determine the fair value of net assets. To complete Step 2, we subtracted from the unit&#146;s Step 1
fair value the determined fair value of the net assets to arrive at the implied fair value of
goodwill. The results of the Step 2 analysis indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the goodwill carrying value of $402&nbsp;million, resulting
in no goodwill impairment. As part of the monitoring process, management performed an assessment
for BPNA at December&nbsp;31, 2010 because, as mentioned above, this unit had failed the Step 1 test in
the annual goodwill evaluation. The Corporation determined BPNA&#146;s fair value utilizing the same
valuation approaches used in the annual goodwill impairment test. The determined fair value for
BPNA at December&nbsp;31, 2010 continued to be below its carrying amount under all valuation approaches.
The fair value determination of BPNA&#146;s assets and liabilities was updated at December&nbsp;31, 2010
utilizing valuation methodologies consistent with the July&nbsp;31, 2010 test. The results of the
assessment at December&nbsp;31, 2010 indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the
goodwill carrying amount, resulting in no goodwill impairment. The results obtained in the December
31, 2010 assessment were consistent with the results of the annual impairment test in that the
reduction in the fair value of BPNA was mainly attributable to the reduced fair value of BPNA&#146;s
loan portfolio.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and
competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. As TARP
recipients, we are subject to the executive compensation provisions of the EESA, including
amendments to such provisions implemented under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,
which are expected to limit the types of compensation arrangements that Popular may enter into with
our most senior leaders upon adoption of implementing standards by the U. S. Treasury. Our
competitors may be in an advantageous position to retain and attract senior leaders since we are
one of only two institutions in Puerto Rico that have received TARP money and are subject to TARP
related compensation provisions. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by
the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the
FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors. Limitations on our
compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented
senior leaders in support of our long term strategy.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. In October
2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies
that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, including
Popular and our banking subsidiaries. The proposal sets forth three key principles for incentive
compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not
encourage excessive risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking
organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation
arrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s
ability to effectively identify and manage risks, be compatible with effective internal controls
and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. The proposal also
contemplates a detailed review by the Federal Reserve Board of the incentive compensation policies
and practices of a number of &#147;large, complex banking organizations.&#148; Any deficiencies in
compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory
ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The proposal
provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive
compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to
the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective
measures to correct the deficiencies. Separately, the FDIC has solicited comments on whether to
amend its risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to potentially increase assessment rates
on financial institutions with compensation programs that put the FDIC deposit insurance fund at
risk, and proposed legislation would subject compensation practices at financial institutions to
heightened standards and increased scrutiny.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators&#146; policies on executive compensation are
continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other
operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include capitalizing
subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Actions by the rating agencies or having capital levels below well-capitalized could raise the cost
of our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements in
the future and may have other adverse effects on our business.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated
securities are usually required by the market to pay higher rates than obligations of higher credit
quality. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, Popular had repurchase agreements amounting to $260&nbsp;million that
were subject to rating triggers or the maintenance of well-capitalized regulatory capital ratios,
that call for an increase in their interest rate in the event of a rating downgrade.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market for non-investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for
investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt
securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand to
complete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated
securities.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect our
relationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our
hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit
counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based
on our below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral
requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute
counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital
levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. In addition,
servicing, licensing and custodial agreements that we are party to with third parties, include
ratings covenants. Servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership
interest in the underlying mortgage loans. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings,
the third parties could have the right to require Popular to engage a substitute fund custodian
and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential
mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to
post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not
maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $163&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2010. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements.
Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when
needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds
could reduce Popular&#146;s liquidity resources and impact its operating results. The termination of
those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an
adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a
ratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in
transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings
remain below investment grade.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>We are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines
our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular and
our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets,
liabilities and certain off balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators
regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital
guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be
materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain well-capitalized status under the
regulatory framework, or are deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if we
experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company and our related
eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and our ability to offer
certain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of making
it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less
responsive to stockholder control.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are
divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders,
one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and the
other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control of
the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held
before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of
incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed by
the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds of the combined voting power of
the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have
the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of
Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage
attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involved
and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a
potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a
stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock.

Venezuela that EVERTEC believed could not be rejected under governing local law and policies, but which

the transmission, through EVERTEC&#146;s Costa Rica subsidiary, of data relating to debit card payment

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We entered into an FDIC-assisted transaction involving Westernbank , which could present
additional risks to our business. On April&nbsp;30, 2010, BPPR acquired certain assets and assumed
certain liabilities of Westernbank from the FDIC in an assisted transaction. Although this
transaction provides for FDIC assistance to BPPR to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing
exposure to loan losses (80% of the losses in substantially all the acquired portfolio will be
borne by the FDIC) and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the former
Westernbank, we are still subject to some of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank
in a negotiated transaction. Such risks include risks associated with maintaining customer
relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within
the timeframes we expect. In addition, because the FDIC-assisted transaction was structured in a
manner that did not allow bidders the time and access to information normally associated with
preparing for and evaluating a negotiated transaction, we may face additional risks in the
FDIC-assisted transaction.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>The FDIC-assisted transaction increased BPPR&#146;s commercial real estate and construction loan
portfolio, which have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans.</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the acquisition of most of the former Westernbank&#146;s loan portfolio, the commercial real
estate loan and construction loan portfolios represent a larger portion of BPPR&#146;s total loan
portfolio than prior to the FDIC-assisted transaction. This type of lending is generally considered
to have more complex credit risks than traditional single-family residential or consumer lending,
because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the
successful operation or completion of the related real estate or construction project.
Consequently, these loans are more sensitive to the current adverse conditions in the real estate
market and the general economy. These loans are generally less predictable, more difficult to
evaluate and monitor, and their collateral may be more difficult to dispose of in a market decline.
Furthermore, since these loans are to Puerto Rico based borrowers, Popular&#146;s credit exposure
concentration in Puerto Rico increased as a result of the acquisition. Although, the negative
economic aspects of these risks are substantially reduced as a result of the FDIC loss sharing
agreements, changes in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher loan charge-offs
in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction all of which would not be totally supported by the
loss sharing agreements with the FDIC.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acquired significant portfolios of loans in the FDIC-assisted transaction. Although these
loan portfolios will be initially accounted for at fair value, there is no assurance that the loans
we acquired will not become impaired, which may result in additional charge-offs to this portfolio.
The fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related to
local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level of
charge-offs that we make to our loan portfolio, and consequently, reduce our net income, and may
also increase the level of charge-offs on the loan portfolio that we have acquired and
correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled
and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if other
favorable events occur.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC which provide that 80% of
losses related to specified loan portfolios that we have acquired in connection with the
FDIC-assisted transaction will be borne by the FDIC, we are not protected for all losses resulting
from charge-offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios. Additionally, the loss sharing
agreements have limited terms; therefore, any charge-off of related losses that we experience after
the term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negatively
impact our results of operations. The loss sharing agreements also impose standard requirements on
us which must be satisfied in order to retain loss share protections. The FDIC has the right to
refuse or delay payment for loan losses if the loss sharing agreements are not managed in
accordance with their terms.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Our decisions regarding the fair value of asset</B>s <B>acquired could be inaccurate and our
estimated loss share indemnification asset in the FDIC-assisted transaction may be inaccurate,
which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations, and future prospects.</B></DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loan
portfolios, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other
assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In the FDIC-assisted transaction,
we recorded a loss share indemnification asset that we consider adequate to absorb future losses
which may occur in the acquired loan portfolio. In determining the size of the loss share
indemnification asset, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume
and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic
conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, our actual losses
could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different
economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio. Any increase in future
loan losses could have a negative effect on our operating results. However, in the event expected
losses from the Westernbank portfolio were to increase more than originally expected, the related
increase in loss reserves would be largely offset by higher than expected indemnity payments from
the FDIC.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, retrospective adjustments were made to the
estimated fair values of the covered loans to reflect new information obtained during the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">that existed as of
the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the acquisition-date fair value
measurements. The retrospective adjustments were mostly driven by revisions in credit loss
assumptions because of new information that became available. The revisions principally resulted in
a decrease in the estimated credit losses, thus increasing the fair value of acquired loans and
reducing the FDIC loss share indemnification asset. Refer to the Westernbank FDIC-assisted

failure to comply with any of the guidelines could result in a specific asset or group of assets
permanently losing their loss sharing coverage. Under the terms of the FDIC loss share agreements,
the assignment or transfer of the loss sharing agreements to another entity generally requires the
written consent of the FDIC. No assurances can be given that we will manage the covered assets in
such a way as to always maintain loss share coverage on all such assets.</DIV>

we suspended dividend payments on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. In December&nbsp;2010, we
resumed payment of dividends on our preferred stock, subject to certain conditions agreed to with
our regulators. In connection with the resumption of payment of dividends on our preferred stock,
we agreed to fund the dividend payments out of newly-issued Common Stock issued to employees under
Popular&#146;s existing savings and investment plans or, if such issuances are insufficient, other
common equity capital raised by Popular. It is anticipated that sufficient Common Stock will be
issued under those plans to cover the dividend payment. There can be no assurance that any
dividends will be declared on the Preferred Stock in any future periods. Furthermore, unless we
have redeemed all of the trust preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury or the U.S.
Treasury has transferred all of its trust preferred securities to third parties, the consent of the
U.S. Treasury will be required for us to, among other things, increase the dividend rate per share
of Common Stock above $0.08 per share or to repurchase or redeem equity securities, including our
Common Stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. Popular has also granted registration rights

Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend
policy and has discouraged dividend pay-out ratios that are at the 100% or higher level unless both
asset quality and capital are very strong.

premises and other facilities throughout Puerto Rico. It also owned 7 parking garage buildings and
approximately 35 lots held for future development or for parking facilities also in Puerto Rico,
one building in the U.S. Virgin Islands and one in the British Virgin Islands. In addition, as of
such date, BPPR leased properties mainly for branch operations in approximately 100 locations in
Puerto Rico and 6 locations in the U.S. Virgin Islands. At December&nbsp;31, 2010, BPNA had 119 offices
(principally bank branches) of which 20 were owned and 99 were leased. These offices were located
in New York, Illinois, New Jersey, California, Florida and Texas. Included in this figure is a
leased six story office building in Rosemont, Illinois that is the site of BPNA&#146;s headquarters. Our
management believes that each of our facilities are well maintained and suitable for its purpose.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business. Based on the opinion of legal counsel, management believes that the
final disposition of these matters, except for the matters described below which are in very early
stages and management cannot currently predict their outcome, will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between May&nbsp;14, 2009 and September&nbsp;9, 2009, five putative class actions and two derivative
claims were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the
Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, San Juan Part, against Popular, Inc., and certain of its
directors and officers, among others. The five class actions were consolidated into two separate
actions: a securities class action captioned <I>Hoff v. Popular, Inc., et al. </I>(consolidated with <I>Otero
v. Popular, Inc., et al.</I>) and an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)&nbsp;class action
entitled <I>In re Popular, Inc. ERISA Litigation </I>(comprised of the consolidated cases of <I>Walsh v.
Popular, Inc., et al.</I>; <I>Monta&#241;ez v. Popular, Inc., et al.</I>; and <I>Dougan v. Popular, Inc., et al.</I>).</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;19, 2009, plaintiffs in the <I>Hoff </I>case filed a consolidated class action complaint
which included as defendants the underwriters in the May&nbsp;2008 offering of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock,
among others. The consolidated action purported to be on behalf of purchasers of Popular&#146;s
securities between January&nbsp;24, 2008 and February&nbsp;19, 2009 and alleged that the defendants violated
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the
Exchange Act by issuing a series of allegedly false and/or misleading statements and/or omitting to
disclose material facts necessary to make statements made by the
Corporation not false and
misleading. The consolidated action also alleged that the defendants violated Section&nbsp;11, Section
12(a)(2) and Section&nbsp;15 of the Securities Act by making allegedly untrue statements and/or omitting
to disclose material facts necessary to make statements made by the Corporation not false and
misleading in connection with the May&nbsp;2008 offering of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock. The consolidated
securities class action complaint sought class certification, an award of compensatory damages and
reasonable costs and expenses, including counsel
fees. On January&nbsp;11, 2010, Popular, the underwriter defendants and the individual defendants
moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action complaint. On August&nbsp;2, 2010, the U.S.
District Court for the District of Puerto Rico granted the motion to dismiss filed by the</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">underwriter defendants on statute of limitations grounds. The Court also dismissed the Section&nbsp;11
claim brought against Popular&#146;s directors on statute of limitations grounds and the Section
12(a)(2) claim brought against Popular because plaintiffs lacked standing. The Court declined to
dismiss the claims brought against Popular and certain of its officers under Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act (and Rule&nbsp;10b-5 promulgated thereunder), Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and
Sections&nbsp;11 and 15 of the Securities Act, holding that plaintiffs had adequately alleged that
defendants made materially false and misleading statements with the requisite state of mind.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;30, 2009, plaintiffs in the ERISA case filed a consolidated class action
complaint. The consolidated complaint purported to be on behalf of employees participating in the
Popular, Inc. U.S.A. 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan and the Popular, Inc. Puerto Rico Savings
and Investment Plan from January&nbsp;24, 2008 to the date of the Complaint to recover losses pursuant
to Sections&nbsp;409 and 502(a)(2) of ERISA against Popular, certain directors, officers and members of
plan committees, each of whom was alleged to be a plan fiduciary. The consolidated complaint
alleged that defendants breached their alleged fiduciary obligations by, among other things,
failing to eliminate Popular stock as an investment alternative in the plans. The complaint sought
to recover alleged losses to the plans and equitable relief, including injunctive relief and a
constructive trust, along with costs and attorneys&#146; fees. On December&nbsp;21, 2009, and in compliance
with a scheduling order issued by the Court, Popular and the individual defendants submitted an
answer to the amended complaint. Shortly thereafter, on December&nbsp;31, 2009, Popular and the
individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint or, in the
alternative, for judgment on the pleadings. On May&nbsp;5, 2010, a magistrate judge issued a report and
recommendation in which he recommended that the motion to dismiss be denied except with respect to
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, as to which he recommended that the motion be granted. On May&nbsp;19,
2010, Popular filed objections to the magistrate judge&#146;s report and recommendation. On September
30, 2010, the Court issued an order without opinion granting in part and denying in part the motion
to dismiss and providing that the Court would issue an opinion and order explaining its decision.
No opinion was, however, issued prior to the settlement in principle discussed below.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The derivative actions (<I>Garc&#237;a v. Carri&#243;n, et al. </I>and <I>D&#237;az v. Carri&#243;n, et al.</I>) were brought
purportedly for the benefit of nominal defendant Popular, Inc. against certain executive officers
and directors and alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of assets and abuse of control in
connection with our issuance of allegedly false and misleading financial statements and financial
reports and the offering of the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock. The derivative complaints sought a
judgment that the action was a proper derivative action, an award of damages, restitution, costs
and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, costs and expenses. On October&nbsp;9, 2009,
the Court coordinated for purposes of discovery the <I>Garc&#237;a </I>action and the consolidated securities
class action. On October&nbsp;15, 2009, Popular and the individual defendants moved to dismiss the
<I>Garc&#237;a </I>complaint for failure to make a demand on the Board of Directors prior to initiating
litigation. On November&nbsp;20, 2009, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and on December&nbsp;21, 2009,
Popular and the individual defendants moved to dismiss the Garc&#237;a amended complaint. At a
scheduling conference held on January&nbsp;14, 2010, the Court stayed discovery in both the <I>Hoff </I>and
<I>Garc&#237;a </I>matters pending resolution of their respective motions to dismiss. On August&nbsp;11, 2010, the
Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss the <I>Garcia </I>action. The Court
dismissed the gross mismanagement and corporate waste claims, but declined to dismiss the breach of
fiduciary duty claim. The <I>D&#237;az </I>case, filed in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, San Juan,
was removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. On October&nbsp;13, 2009,
Popular and the individual defendants moved to consolidate the <I>Garc&#237;a </I>and <I>D&#237;az </I>actions. On October
26, 2009, plaintiff moved to remand the <I>Diaz </I>case to the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance and to
stay defendants&#146; consolidation motion pending the outcome of the remand proceedings. On September
30, 2010, the Court issued an order without opinion remanding the <I>Diaz </I>case to the Puerto Rico
Court of First Instance. On October&nbsp;13, 2010, the Court issued a Statement of Reasons In Support of
Remand Order. On October&nbsp;28, 2010, Popular and the individual defendants moved for reconsideration
of the remand order. The court denied Popular&#146;s request for reconsideration shortly thereafter.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;13, 2010, the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance in San Juan granted summary
judgment dismissing a separate complaint brought by plaintiff in the <I>Garc&#237;a </I>action that sought to
enforce an alleged right to inspect the books and records of the Corporation in support of the
pending derivative action. The Court held that plaintiff had not propounded a &#147;proper purpose&#148;
under Puerto Rico law for such inspection. On April&nbsp;28, 2010, plaintiff in that action moved for
reconsideration of the Court&#146;s dismissal. On May&nbsp;4, 2010, the Court denied plaintiff&#146;s request for
reconsideration. On June&nbsp;7, 2010, plaintiff filed an appeal before the Puerto Rico Court of
Appeals. On June&nbsp;11, 2010, Popular and the individual defendants moved to dismiss the appeal. On
June&nbsp;22, 2010, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal. On July&nbsp;6, 2010, plaintiff moved for
reconsideration of the Court&#146;s dismissal. On July&nbsp;16, 2010, the Court of Appeals denied plaintiff&#146;s
request for reconsideration.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Court&#146;s request, the parties to the <I>Hoff </I>and <I>Garc&#237;a </I>cases discussed the prospect of
mediation and agreed to nonbinding mediation in an attempt to determine whether the cases could be
settled. On January&nbsp;18-19, 2011, the parties to the <I>Hoff </I>and <I>Garc&#237;a </I>cases engaged in nonbinding
mediation before the Honorable Nicholas Politan. As a result of the mediation, the Corporation and
the other named defendants to the <I>Hoff </I>matter entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle
this matter. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, subject to certain customary
conditions including court approval of a final settlement agreement in consideration for the full
settlement and release of all defendants, the amount of $37.5&nbsp;million will be paid by or on behalf
of defendants (of which management expects approximately $30&nbsp;million will be covered by insurance).
The parties intend to file a stipulation of
settlement and a joint motion for preliminary approval within 45&nbsp;days of the execution of the
memorandum of understanding. Popular&#146;s recognized a charge, net
of the amount expected to be
covered by insurance, of $7.5&nbsp;million in December&nbsp;2010 to cover the uninsured
portion of the settlement.</DIV>

derivative actions the Corporation does not expect to be liable for the payment of any money award,
other than the possible payment of the plaintiff&#146;s attorneys fees.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is aware that a suit asserting similar claims on behalf of certain individual
shareholders under the federal securities laws was filed on January&nbsp;18, 2011.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the <I>Hoff </I>and derivative action mediation, the parties to the ERISA class
action,entered into a separate memorandum of understanding to settle that action. Under the terms
of the ERISA memorandum of understanding, subject to certain customary conditions including court
approval of a final settlement agreement in consideration for the full settlement and release of
all defendants, the amount of $8.2&nbsp;million will be paid by or on behalf of the defendants (all of
which management expects will be covered by insurance). The parties intend to file a joint request
to approve the settlement by approximately the middle of April&nbsp;2011.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular does not expect to record any material gain or loss as a result of the settlements.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;7, 2010, a putative class action for breach of contract and damages captioned
<I>Almeyda-Santiago v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico</I>, was filed in the Puerto Rico Court of First
Instance against Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. The complaint essentially asserts that plaintiff has
suffered damages because of Banco Popular&#146;s allegedly fraudulent overdraft fee practices in
connection with debit card transactions. Such practices allegedly consist of: (a)&nbsp;the
reorganization of electronic debit transactions in high-to-low order so as to multiply the number
of overdraft fees assessed on its customers; (b)&nbsp;the assessment of overdraft fees even when clients
have not overdrawn their accounts; (c)&nbsp;the failure to disclose, or to adequately disclose, its
overdraft policy to its customers; and (d)&nbsp;the provision of false and fraudulent information
regarding its clients&#146; account balances at point of sale transactions and on its website. Plaintiff
seeks damages, restitution and provisional remedies against Banco Popular for breach of contract,
abuse of trust, illegal conversion and unjust enrichment. The Corporation intends to vigorously
contend these claims.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;13, 2010, Popular was served with a class action complaint captioned <I>Garc&#237;a
Lamadrid, et al. v. Banco Popular, et al. </I>which was filed in the Puerto Rico Court of First
Instance. The complaint generally seeks damages against Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, other defendants
and their respective insurance companies for their alleged breach of certain fiduciary duties,
breach of contract, and alleged violations of local tort law. Plaintiffs seek in excess of
$600,000,000 in damages, plus costs and attorneys fees.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, plaintiffs &#151; Guillermo Garc&#237;a Lamadrid and Benito del Cueto Figueras &#151; are
suing defendant BPPR for the losses they (and others) experienced through their investment in the
RG Financial Corporation-backed Conservation Trust Fund securities. Plaintiffs essentially claim
that Banco Popular allegedly breached its fiduciary duties to them by failing to keep all relevant
parties informed of any developments that could affect the Conservation Trust notes or that could
become an event of default under the relevant trust agreements; and that in so doing, it acted
imprudently, unreasonably and grossly negligently. Popular must answer or otherwise plead by
February&nbsp;28, 2011.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this early stage, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse
outcome, or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss. It is possible that the ultimate
resolution of the <I>Almeyda-Santiago </I>and <I>Garc&#237;a Lamadrid </I>cases, if unfavorable, may be material to
our results of operations.

do not accumulate in the event they are not paid.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;2009, Popular announced the suspension of dividends on its Series&nbsp;A and B preferred

which are approximately $3.7&nbsp;million per year on an annualized basis, Popular has committed to the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to fund the dividend payments out of newly-issued
Common Stock issued to employees under Popular&#146;s existing savings and investment plans or, if such
issuances are insufficient, other common equity capital raised by Popular. It is anticipated that
sufficient Common Stock will be issued under those plans to cover the dividend payment. There can

Series&nbsp;A preferred stock and Series&nbsp;B preferred stock and for trust preferred securities (also
referred as capital securities). On August&nbsp;25, 2009, we completed the settlement of the exchange
offer and issued 357,510,076 new shares of Common Stock.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in August&nbsp;2009, Popular, Inc. and Popular Capital Trust III exchanged all 935,000
shares of Popular&#146;s outstanding fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series&nbsp;C, $1,000
liquidation preference per share (the &#147;Series&nbsp;C Preferred Stock&#148;), owned by the U.S Treasury for
935,000 newly issued trust preferred securities, $1,000 liquidation amount per capital security. In
connection with this exchange, the trust used the Series&nbsp;C preferred stock, together with the
proceeds of the issuance and sale by the trust to Popular of $1&nbsp;million aggregate liquidation
amount of its fixed rate common securities, to purchase $936&nbsp;million aggregate principal amount of
the junior subordinated debentures issued by Popular.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the exchange agreement, Popular agreed that, without the consent of the U.S. Treasury,
it would not increase our dividend rate per share of the Common Stock above that in effect as of
October&nbsp;14, 2008, $0.08 per share, or repurchase shares of the Common Stock until, in each case,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2010, Popular raised $1.15&nbsp;billion through the sale of 46,000,000 depositary shares,
each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of contingent convertible perpetual non-cumulative
preferred stock, Series&nbsp;D, no par value, $1,000 liquidation preference per share. The preferred
stock represented by depositary shares automatically converted into the Common Stock at a
conversion rate of 8.3333 shares of Common Stock for each depositary share on May&nbsp;11, 2010, which
was the 5th business day after Popular&#146;s common shareholders approved the amendment to Popular&#146;s
restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock.
The conversion of the depositary shares of preferred stock resulted in the issuance of 383,333,333
additional shares of Common Stock. The net proceeds from the public offering amounted to
approximately $1.1&nbsp;billion, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses. Note 26, &#147;Net (loss)&nbsp;income per common share&#148;, to the audited consolidated financial
statements provides information on the impact of the conversion on net (loss) income per common share.</DIV>

average market price at the time of the issuance, as well as purchase shares of Common Stock
directly from Popular by making optional cash payments at prevailing market prices. No shares will
be sold directly by us to participants in the dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan at less
than the par value of our Common Stock. No additional shares were issued under the dividend
reinvestment during 2009 and 2010.</DIV>

    <TD>On November&nbsp;3, 2008, Popular sold residual interests and
servicing related assets of PFH and Popular, FS to Goldman Sachs
Mortgage Company, Goldman, Sachs &#038; Co. and Litton Loan Servicing,
LP. In addition, on September&nbsp;18, 2008, Popular announced the
consummation of the sale of manufactured housing loans of PFH to
21st Mortgage Corp. and Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc. The
above transactions and past sales and restructuring plans
executed at PFH in the past two years have resulted in the
discontinuance of our PFH operations and PFH&#146;s results are
reflected as such in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The computation of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock
dividends excludes discontinued operations. Prior periods have
been retrospectively adjusted on a comparable basis.</TD>
