facilities if there is real estate as collateral. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability that exceeds debt service requirements. Non

future losses on such loans under the terms of the loss sharing agreements. Foreclosed other real estate properties are also covered under the loss sharing agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the loss sharing agreements, the FDIC&#146;s obligation
to reimburse BPPR for losses with respect to assets covered by such agreements (the &#147;covered assets&#148;) begins with the first dollar of loss incurred. On a combined basis, the FDIC will reimburse BPPR for 80% of all qualifying losses with
respect to the covered assets during the covered period. BPPR will reimburse the FDIC for 80% of qualifying recoveries with respect to losses for which the FDIC reimbursed BPPR. The loss sharing agreement applicable to single-family residential
mortgage loans provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for ten years, and the loss sharing agreement applicable to commercial and other assets provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for five
years, with additional recovery sharing for three years thereafter. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Because of the loss protection provided
by the FDIC, the risks of the covered loans are significantly different from other loans in our portfolio, thus we have determined to segregate them in our financial statements and in the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. Covered loans are reported in loans exclusive of the estimated FDIC loss share indemnification asset. During the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, retrospective adjustments were made to the estimated fair
values of the covered loans to reflect new information obtained during the measurement period (as defined by ASC Topic 805), about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the
acquisition-date fair value measurements. The retrospective adjustments were mostly driven by revisions in credit loss assumptions because of new information that became available. The revisions principally resulted in a decrease in the estimated
credit losses, thus increasing the fair value of acquired loans and reducing the FDIC loss share indemnification asset. Refer to Note 4, &#147;Business Combination&#148;, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the
Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Covered loans are, and will continue to be, reviewed for
collectability, based on the expectations of cash flows on these loans. If there is a decrease in expected cash flows on the covered loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 (consisting of all covered loans except for revolving lines of credit)
due to an increase in estimated credit losses compared to the estimate made at the April&nbsp;30, 2010 acquisition date, we will record a charge to the provision for loan losses and an allowance for loan losses will be established. If there is an
increase in inherent losses on the covered loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-20 (consisting of revolving lines of credit), an allowance for loan losses will also be established to record the loans at their net realizable value. In both
cases, a related credit to income and an increase in the FDIC loss share indemnification asset will be recognized at the same time, measured based on the loss share percentages described above. </FONT></P>

financial strength of any guarantor. Most of our commercial and construction loans are secured by real estate and other collateral. A review of the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party appraisals of machinery and
equipment and commercial real estate, as appropriate, is also conducted. Physical inspection of the collateral and audits of receivables is conducted when appropriate. Our credit policies provide maximum loan-to-value ratios that limit the size of a

financial statements provided to us. Although, a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, for&nbsp;risk assessment purposes, Popular defines subprime loans as borrowers with one or a
combination of certain credit risk factors, such as FICO scores (generally less than 620 for secured products and 660 for unsecured products), high debt to income ratios (higher than 50%) and inferior payment history, including factors such as
defaults and limited credit history. Popular does not target subprime borrowers and does not offer products specifically designed for subprime borrowers. In Puerto Rico, as of December&nbsp;31, 2011, consumer and mortgage loans with subprime
characteristics consisted of $970.5 million (33% of the Puerto Rico consumer loan portfolio) and $1.4 billion (30% of the Puerto Rico mortgage loans portfolio), respectively. BPPR&#146;s loans are normally fixed-rate, fully amortizing, full
documentation loans that do not have the level of layered risk associated with subprime loans offered by certain major U.S. mortgage loan originators. As of December&nbsp;31, 2011, our mainland United States consumer and mortgage loans with subprime
characteristics consisted of $89.1 million (or&nbsp;13 % of the U.S. mainland consumer loan portfolio) and $456 million (or 55% of U.S. mainland mortgage loans portfolio). As part of the restructuring of our U.S. mainland operations, we discontinued

whether the borrower will continue to be a going concern; (iv)&nbsp;currently, the borrower has securities that have been delisted, are in the process of being delisted, or are under threat of being delisted from an exchange; and (v)&nbsp;based on
estimates and projections that only encompass the current business capabilities, the borrower forecasts that its entity-specific cash flows will be insufficient to service the debt (both interest and principal) in accordance with the contractual
terms of the existing agreement through maturity; and absent the current modification, the borrower cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at an effective interest rate equal to the current market interest rate for

<P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We have taken significant steps during the past years to counter the effect of the broad economic slowdown in the United
States and the prolonged economic recession in Puerto Rico, our principal market, where the economy entered into recession in the second quarter of 2006. In 2008, we considered it prudent to participate in the TARP Capital Purchase Program in order
to strengthen our capital and liquidity position. In December 2008, we received $935 million from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#147;U.S. Treasury&#148;) as part of the TARP Capital Purchase Program in exchange for senior Perpetual Preferred
Stock and a warrant to purchase 20,932,836 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.70 per share. The shares of Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital and paid cumulative dividends quarterly at a rate of 5%&nbsp;per
annum for the first five years, and 9%&nbsp;per annum thereafter. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The TARP Capital Purchase Program gave us
the opportunity to raise capital quickly and improve our liquidity position, at a low cost, with limited shareholder dilution, at a time when the unprecedented market instability made it difficult, if not impossible, for us to raise capital. We have
used proceeds from the TARP, together with other available moneys, to make capital contributions and loans to our banking subsidiaries to ensure they remain well-capitalized, and strengthen their ability to continue creditworthy lending in our home
markets. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In August 2009, we completed an exchange offer in order to increase our common equity capital to
accommodate the more adverse economic and credit scenarios assumed under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (the &#147;SCAP&#148;), as applied to regional banking institutions. With the exchange offer we issued 357.5&nbsp;million new shares
of Common Stock and increased our Tier 1 common equity by $1.4 billion. For more information about the exchange please refer to Note 22 &#151;&#148;Exchange Offers&#148;, to the consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In connection with the public exchange offer, we agreed with the U.S. Treasury to exchange the $935 million senior
perpetual preferred stock issued to it pursuant to the TARP Capital Purchase Program for $935 million of newly issued perpetual trust preferred securities, with the same distribution rate as that of the Preferred Stock. This exchange was completed
in August 2009. The trust preferred securities have a distribution rate of 5% until December&nbsp;5, 2013 and 9% thereafter. The warrant initially issued to the U.S Treasury in connection with the issuance of the Preferred Stock in December 2008
remained outstanding without amendment and currently represents 2% of our Common Stock outstanding. </FONT></P>

the completion of the exchange offer, during 2008 and 2009, we carried out various restructurings plans for our operations in the U.S. mainland to improve our U.S. operations, address credit quality, contain controllable costs, maintain well

reduction in hiring and pension plan freezes, and the suspension of matching contributions to retirement plans. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:7%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I><U>New

implementation of a voluntary employee retirement window at the end of 2011. As a result of this initiative in December 2011, we recorded $15.6 million in pension costs related to 369 employees that were eligible and elected to participate in the
retirement program. The retirement was effective on January&nbsp;31, 2012. Annual cost savings from this reduction in headcount are estimated to be approximately $15 million. </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The financial services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. In Puerto Rico, our primary market, the
banking business is highly competitive with respect to originating loans, acquiring deposits and providing other banking services. Most of our direct competition for our products and services comes from commercial banks. The Puerto Rico market is
dominated by locally based commercial banks with assets between $3 million and $28 billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2011, including BPPR, and a few large U.S. and foreign banks. On April&nbsp;30, 2010, the FDIC closed three commercial banks and
entered into loss-share purchase and assumption agreements with three other commercial banks with operations in Puerto Rico, including us with respect to Westernbank Puerto Rico. Those transactions involved the acquisition of most of the assets and
liabilities of the closed banks, including the assumption of all of the non-brokered deposits. This development could result in some of our competitors gaining greater resources, such as a broader range of products and services. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2011, there were 10 commercial banks operating in Puerto Rico. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We also compete with
specialized players in the local financial industry that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those competitors include brokerage houses, mortgage companies, insurance companies, credit
unions (locally known as &#147;cooperativas&#148;), credit card companies, consumer finance companies, institutional lenders and other financial and non-financial institutions and entities. Credit unions generally provide basic consumer financial
services. Some of those competitors are significantly larger than us, have lower cost structures and many have fewer regulatory constraints. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In the United States, our competition is primarily from community banks operating in our footprint and national banking institutions. Those include institutions with much more resources than we have that
can exert substantial competitive pressure. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In both Puerto Rico and the United States, the primary factors in
competing for business include pricing, convenience of office locations and other delivery methods, range of products offered, and the level of service delivered. We must compete effectively along all these parameters to be successful. We may
experience pricing pressure as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. Competition is particularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is very aggressive. Increased competition could require that we
increase the rates offered on deposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT

reported as a reportable segment prior to such date, while the merchant acquiring business was originally included in the BPPR reportable segment through June&nbsp;30, 2010. As a result of the sale, we no longer present EVERTEC as a reportable

Party Transactions&#148;, we sold our equity investments in CONTADO and Serfinsa during 2011. In 2011, we recorded $4.3 million in operating expenses because of the write-off of our investment in TRANRED as we determined to wind-down these
operations. The results for TRANRED and the equity investments are included in the Corporate group for all periods presented. Revenue from the 49% ownership interest in EVERTEC is reported as non-interest income in the Corporate group. </FONT></P>

first time (for example, an enterprise-wide limit on exposures to any one counterparty and certain of its affiliates established at 25% of the capital and surplus of the covered company, and others overlap with other regulatory reforms (for example,
the Basel III capital and liquidity reforms discussed below in this section). The Proposed SIFI Rules also address the Dodd-Frank Act&#146;s early remediation requirements applicable to bank holding companies that have total consolidated assets of
$50 billion or more. The proposed remediation rules are modeled after the prompt corrective action regime, described below, but are designed to require action beginning in the earlier stages of a company&#146;s financial distress by mandating action
on the basis of arranged triggers, including capital and leverage, stress test results, liquidity and risk management. The Proposed SIFI Rule&#146;s requirements generally will become effective on the first day of the fifth calendar quarter after
the effective date of the final rule, although certain requirements have different transition periods. Although by their terms most of the Proposed SIFI Rule&#146;s requirement apply only to bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total
consolidated assets pursuant to Section 165(i)(2), the Proposed SIFI Rule requires bank holding companies and member banks with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets to conduct its own annual stress tests and publish a summary of the
results of the stress tests. In addition, it is possible that the Federal Reserve may determine in the future to apply some or all of the Proposed SIFI Rules to smaller bank holding companies. </FONT></P>

In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to
the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital
plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is
treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. </FONT></P>

receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve fund. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole
or in part, the outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared until capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original capital. </FONT></P>

the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less than 20% of its demand liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a
state of the United States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the reserve requirements of
Section&nbsp;16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated November&nbsp;24, 1982, BPPR has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, BPPR is
subject to the reserve requirements prescribed by the Banking Law. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">As previously mentioned on the Business
section, Section&nbsp;17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to any one person, firm, partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of fifteen percent (15%)&nbsp;of the paid-in capital and reserve fund of the bank. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2011, the legal lending limit for BPPR under this provision was approximately $215 million. In the case of loans which are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the maximum aggregate amount is
increased to one third of the paid-in capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the institution is well capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the Office of the Commissioner or any regulatory agency, its legal
lending limit shall also include 15% of 50% of its undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided profits.
Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section&nbsp;17 on
the amount of loans that are wholly secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or instrumentalities of Puerto
Rico. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Section&nbsp;14 of the Banking Law authorizes a bank to conduct certain financial and related

exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which entered into a recession in the second quarter of 2006. Based on information published by the Puerto Rico Planning Board, the Puerto Rico real gross national product decreased an estimated 3.6% during
fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and is projected to have declined 1% by the end of fiscal 2011, which ended June&nbsp;30, 2011. The Puerto Rico economy, however, continues to be susceptible to fluctuations in the price of crude oil due to its
high dependence on fuel oil for energy production. Popular&#146;s assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 39, &#147;Segment Reporting&#148; to the consolidated financial statements.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The lingering effects of the prolonged recession are still reflected in limited loan demand and high levels of
non-performing assets, loan loss provisions and charge-offs, particularly in our commercial loan portfolio in Puerto Rico, an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on mortgage loans granted in Puerto Rico, and a reduction in the
value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio, all of which have adversely affected our profitability. If the price of crude oil increases and if global economic conditions worsen, those adverse effects could continue. Also, a potential reduction
in consumer spending may also impact growth in our non-interest revenues. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">For additional information regarding

approximately 2%, 32% and 27% of our non-covered loan portfolio constituted of construction, commercial secured by real estate and mortgage loans, respectively. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Substantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is
located in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within
each specific real estate market. Recent economic reports related to the real estate market in Puerto Rico indicate that certain pockets of the real estate market are subject to reductions in value related to general economic conditions. In certain
mainland markets like southern Florida, Illinois and California, we have experienced the negative impact associated with low absorption rates and property value adjustments due to overbuilding. We measure loan impairment based on the fair value of
the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, which is derived from estimated collateral values, principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration prices in observed transactions involving similar assets in similar
locations, size and supply and demand. An appraisal report is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the
property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, given the current slowdown in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if
foreclosed. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Construction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential real estate
properties entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns.
As of December&nbsp;31, 2011, non-covered commercial and construction loans secured by commercial real estate properties, amounted to $7.0 billion or 34% of the total non-covered loan portfolio. </FONT></P>

projects. Total assets of those subsidiaries amounted to $50.5 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2011, of which $32.5 million or 65% of total assets are foreclosed properties. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:7%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2011, net charge-offs specifically related to values of properties securing our
non-covered construction, commercial and mortgage loan portfolios totaled $39.5 million, $138.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Continued deterioration on the fair value of real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired loans would
require increases in our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the credit quality of our

standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expands the FDIC&#146;s authority to raise insurance premiums. The legislation also calls for the FDIC to raise the ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by
September&nbsp;30, 2020 and to &#147;offset the effect&#148; of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions,

products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards, and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower&#146;s ability to repay and prepayment penalties. The Dodd-Frank
Act also includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts. The legislation also restricts proprietary

premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on, among other things, secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels. In May 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule, effective June&nbsp;30, 2009, that imposed a special assessment of 5 cents for every
$100 on each insured depository institution&#146;s assets minus its Tier 1 capital as of June&nbsp;30, 2009, subject to a cap equal to 10 cents per $100 of assessable deposits for the second quarter 2009 risk-based capital assessment. This special
assessment applied to us and resulted in a $16.7 million expense in our second quarter of 2009. On November&nbsp;12, 2009, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring banks to prepay three years&#146; worth of premiums to replenish its depleted insurance

2011 second quarter assessment and payable in September 2011, which outline significant changes in the risk-based premiums approach for banks with over $10 billion of assets and creates a &#147;Scorecard&#148; system. The &#147;Scorecard&#148;
system uses a performance score and loss severity score, which aggregate to an initial base assessment rate. The assessment base also changes from deposits to an institution&#146;s average total assets minus its average tangible equity. For 2011 the

amount of its equity book value as of the September&nbsp;30, 2011 valuation date, requiring the completion of Step 2. Step 2 required a valuation of all assets and liabilities of the BPNA unit, including any recognized and unrecognized intangible

results obtained in the December&nbsp;31, 2011 assessment were consistent with the results of the annual impairment test in that the reduction in the fair value of BPNA was mainly attributable to the reduced fair value of BPNA&#146;s loan portfolio.

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. In October 2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies that applies
to all banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, including Popular and our banking subsidiaries. The proposal sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that
incentive compensation plans do not encourage excessive risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should
provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate
governance. The proposal also contemplates a detailed review by the Federal Reserve Board of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of &#147;large, complex banking organizations.&#148; Any deficiencies in compensation
practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The proposal provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a
banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures
to correct the deficiencies. Separately, the FDIC has solicited comments on whether to amend its risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to potentially increase assessment rates on financial institutions with compensation programs that put
the FDIC deposit insurance fund at risk, and proposed legislation would subject compensation practices at financial institutions to heightened standards and increased scrutiny. </FONT></P>

and other distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial

agreements with substitute counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. In addition, servicing, licensing and
custodial agreements that we are party to with third parties, include ratings covenants. Servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans. Upon failure to maintain the required
credit ratings, the third parties could have the right to require Popular to engage a substitute fund custodian and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit
recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $140
million at December&nbsp;31, 2011. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral
under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce Popular&#146;s liquidity resources and impact its operating results. The termination of those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have
an adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a

considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional single-family residential or consumer lending, because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful operation or completion of the
related real estate or construction project. Consequently, these loans are more sensitive to the current adverse conditions in the real estate market and the general economy. These loans are generally less predictable, more difficult to evaluate and
monitor, and their collateral may be more difficult to dispose of in a market decline. Furthermore, since these loans are to Puerto Rico based borrowers, Popular&#146;s credit exposure concentration in Puerto Rico increased as a result of the
acquisition. Although, the negative economic aspects of these risks are substantially reduced as a result of the FDIC loss sharing agreements, changes in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher loan charge-offs in connection with
