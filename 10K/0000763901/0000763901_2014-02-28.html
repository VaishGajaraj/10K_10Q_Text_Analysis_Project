C&amp;I loans are underwritten individually and usually secured with the assets of the company and the personal guarantee of the business owners. CRE loans consist of loans for income producing real estate properties and real estate developers and
the financing of owner-occupied facilities if there is real estate as collateral. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability that exceeds
debt service requirements. Non-owner-occupied CRE loans are generally made to finance office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the property.

&#147;covered loans&#148;, as BPPR is entitled to be reimbursed by the FDIC for a substantial portion of any future losses on such loans under the terms of the loss sharing agreements. Foreclosed other real estate properties are also covered under
the loss sharing agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the loss sharing agreements, the FDIC&#146;s obligation to reimburse BPPR for losses with respect to assets covered by such agreements (the &#147;covered assets&#148;) begins with the first
dollar of loss incurred. On a combined basis, the FDIC will reimburse BPPR for 80% of all qualifying losses with respect to the covered assets during the covered period. BPPR will reimburse the FDIC for 80% of qualifying recoveries with respect to
losses for which the FDIC reimbursed BPPR. The loss sharing agreement applicable to single-family residential mortgage loans provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for ten years, and the loss sharing agreement applicable
to commercial and other assets provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for five years, with additional recovery sharing for three years thereafter. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC, the risks of the covered loans are significantly different from
other loans in our portfolio, thus we have determined to segregate them in our financial statements and in the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Covered loans are reported in loans exclusive
of the estimated FDIC loss share indemnification asset. During the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2010, retrospective adjustments were made to the estimated fair values of the covered loans to reflect new information obtained during the measurement
period (as defined by ASC Topic 805), about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the acquisition-date fair value measurements. The retrospective adjustments were mostly driven by
revisions in credit loss assumptions because of new information that became available. The revisions principally resulted in a decrease in the estimated credit losses, thus increasing the fair value of acquired loans and reducing the FDIC loss share
indemnification asset. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Covered loans are, and will continue to be, reviewed for collectability, based on the
expectations of cash flows on these loans. If there is a decrease in expected cash flows on the covered loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 (consisting of all covered loans except for revolving lines of credit) due to an increase in
estimated credit losses compared to the estimate made at the April&nbsp;30, 2010 acquisition date, we will record a charge to the provision for loan losses and an allowance for loan losses will be established. If there is an increase in inherent
losses on the covered loans accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-20 (consisting of revolving lines of credit), an allowance for loan losses will also be established to record the loans at their net realizable value. In both cases, a related credit
to income and an increase in the FDIC loss share indemnification asset will be recognized at the same time, measured based on the loss share percentages described above. </P>

the financing of owner-occupied facilities if there is real estate as collateral. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability that exceeds
debt service requirements. Non owner-occupied CRE loans are generally made to finance office and industrial buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the property.

and the financial strength of any guarantor. Most of our commercial and construction loans are secured by real estate and other collateral. A review of the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party appraisals of machinery
and equipment and commercial real estate, as appropriate, is also conducted. Physical inspection of the collateral and audits of receivables is conducted when appropriate. Our credit policies provide maximum loan-to-value ratios that limit the size
of a loan to a maximum percentage of the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value percentage varies by the type of collateral. Our loan-to value limitations are, in certain cases, determined by other risk factors such
as the financial strength of the borrower or guarantor, the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself. Most CRE loans are originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners. Non-recourse

financial statements provided to us. Although, a standard industry definition for subprime loans does not exist, for risk assessment purposes, subprime consumer and mortgage loans in the BPPR segment are determined based on the final rule definition
of higher risk consumer loans issued by the FDIC which was made effective during 2013. A higher-risk consumer loan is defined as a loan where, as of origination, or as of refinance, the probability of default (PD) within two years is greater than
20%. In Puerto Rico, as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, consumer and mortgage loans with subprime characteristics consisted of $245 million (7% of the Puerto Rico consumer loan portfolio) and $752.1 million (14% of the Puerto Rico mortgage loan
portfolio), respectively. Since the final rule definition is not applicable to our US operation, subprime loans in the BPNA segment are defined as borrowers with one or a combination of certain credit risk factors, such as FICO scores (generally
less than 620 for secured products and 660 for unsecured products), high debt to income ratios (higher than 50%) and inferior payment history, including factors such as defaults and limited credit history. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, our mainland
United States consumer and mortgage loans with subprime characteristics consisted of $75.5 million (or 12% of the U.S. mainland consumer loan portfolio) and $479.4 million (or 37% of U.S. mainland mortgage loans portfolio). As part of the
restructuring of our U.S. mainland operations, we discontinued originating loans with subprime characteristics in those operations, including the U.S. non-conventional mortgage loan portfolio and E-LOAN. Popular does not target subprime borrowers
and does not offer products specifically designed for subprime borrowers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">As of December&nbsp;31,
2013, there was a nominal amount of interest-only loans in our consumer loans portfolio and $129.6 million of interest-only loans in our mortgage loan portfolio, all of which were at BPPR. Also, we did not have any adjustable rate mortgage loans in
our Puerto Rico portfolio. In Puerto Rico, we offer a special step loan mortgage product to purchasers of units within construction projects financed by BPPR. This product, with a term of up to 40 years, provides for 100% financing at a 2.99%
interest rate for the first five years of the term of the loan and 5.88% fixed-rate for the remaining term. Consistent with our credit policies, the underwriting and loan approval process for our step loan mortgage product is based on a number of
factors, including an assessment of each borrower&#146;s personal financial condition (including verification of income, assets and FICO score), as well as debt-to-equity ratio, reserves, loan-to-value and prior mortgage experience. While Popular
has not established specific limits for FICO scores, debt-to-income ratios and loan-to-values applicable to this product, the underwriting parameters applied to this product are generally similar to the standards used for the underwriting of our

facilities are structured as lines of credit, which are mainly one year in term and therefore are required to be renewed annually. Other facilities may be restructured or extended from time to time based upon changes in the borrower&#146;s business
needs, use of funds, timing of completion of projects and other factors. If the borrower is not deemed to have financial difficulties, extensions, renewals and restructurings are done in the normal course of business and not considered concessions,
and the loans continue to be recorded as performing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We evaluate various factors in order to determine if a borrower
is experiencing financial difficulties. Indicators that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties include, for example: (i)&nbsp;the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt or it is probable that the borrower would be in
payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification; (ii)&nbsp;the borrower has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy; (iii)&nbsp;there is significant doubt as to whether the borrower will continue
to be a going concern; (iv)&nbsp;currently, the borrower has securities that have been delisted, are in the process of being delisted, or are under threat of being delisted from an exchange; and (v)&nbsp;based on estimates and projections that only
encompass the current business capabilities, the borrower forecasts that its entity-specific cash flows will be insufficient to service the debt (both interest and principal) in accordance with the contractual terms of the existing agreement through
maturity; and absent the current modification, the borrower cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at an effective interest rate equal to the current market interest rate for similar debt for a non-troubled debtor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We have specialized workout officers who handle substantially all commercial loans that are past due 90 days and over,
borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, and those that are considered problem loans based on their risk profile. As a general policy, we do not advance additional money to borrowers that are 90 days past due or over. In commercial and
construction loans, certain exceptions may be approved under certain circumstances, including (i)&nbsp;when past due status is administrative in nature, such as expiration of a loan facility before the new documentation is executed, and not as a
result of payment or credit issues; (ii)&nbsp;to improve our collateral position or otherwise maximize recovery or mitigate potential future losses; and (iii)&nbsp;with respect to certain entities that, although related through common ownership, are
not cross defaulted nor cross-collateralized and are performing satisfactorily under their respective loan facilities. Such advances are underwritten following our credit policy guidelines and approved up to prescribed policy limits, which are
dependent on the borrower&#146;s financial condition, collateral and guarantee, among others. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">While
we monitor lending concentration to a single borrower or a group of related borrowers, we do not have specific lending limits based on industry or other criteria, such as a percentage of the banks&#146; capital, except for the legal lending limit

financial difficulties can be modified as a loss mitigation alternative. New terms and conditions of these loans are individually evaluated to determine a feasible loan restructuring. In many consumer and mortgage loans, a trial period is
established where the borrower has to comply with three consecutive monthly payments under the new terms before implementing the new structure. Loans that are restructured, renewed or extended due to financial difficulties and the terms reflect
concessions that would not otherwise be granted are considered as Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#147;TDRs&#148;). These concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal,
forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. These concessions stem from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or are imposed by law or a court. TDRs also include loans for which the Corporation has entered into
liquidation proceedings with borrowers in which neither principal or interest is forgiven, but the Corporation accepts payments which are different than the contractual payment schedule. Refer to additional information on TDRs on Note 10 to the
consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report for the year ended December&nbsp;31, </P>

in non-accrual status if the loan was in non-accruing status at the time of the modification. The TDR loan will continue in non-accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated a willingness and ability to make the restructured loan payments (at
least six months of sustained performance after classified as TDR and management has concluded whether it is probable that the borrower would not be in payment default in a foreseeable future). If the loan was appropriately on accrual status prior
to the restructuring, the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms (for a period of at least six months, as defined), and the bank&#146;s credit evaluation shows the borrower&#146;s capacity to continue to perform under the
restructured terms (both principal and interest payments), it is likely that the appropriate conclusion is for the loan to remain on accrual at the time of the restructuring. Loans classified as TDRs are excluded from TDR status if performance under
the restructured terms exists for a reasonable period (at least twelve months of sustained performance after being classified) and the loan yields a market rate. </P>

municipalities amounted to $1.2 billion, of which approximately $950 million was outstanding. Of the amount outstanding, $789 million consists of loans and $161 million are securities. From this amount, $527 million represents obligations from the
Government of Puerto Rico and public corporations that are either collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues identified for their repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated
loans to public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as water and electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from the central Government and many receive
appropriations or other payments from it. The remaining $423 million represents obligations from various municipalities in Puerto Rico for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has
been pledged to their repayment. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes </P>

Rico Housing Finance Authority (December 31, 2012 - $294 million). These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. Also, the Corporation had

<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We have taken significant steps during the past years to counter the effect of the broad economic
slowdown in the United States and the prolonged economic recession in Puerto Rico, our principal market, where the economy entered into recession in the second quarter of 2006. In 2008, we considered it prudent to participate in the TARP Capital
Purchase Program in order to strengthen our capital and liquidity position. In December 2008, we received $935 million from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#147;U.S. Treasury&#148;) as part of the TARP Capital Purchase Program in exchange for
senior Perpetual Preferred Stock and a warrant to purchase 2,093,283 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $67 per share (adjusted to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse stock split effective on May&nbsp;29, 2012). The shares of Preferred
Stock qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital and paid cumulative dividends quarterly at a rate of 5%&nbsp;per annum for the first five years, and 9%&nbsp;per annum thereafter. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The TARP Capital Purchase Program gave us the opportunity to raise capital quickly and improve our
liquidity position, at a low cost, with limited shareholder dilution, at a time when the unprecedented market instability made it difficult, if not impossible, for us to raise capital. We have used proceeds from the TARP, together with other
available moneys, to make capital contributions and loans to our banking subsidiaries to ensure they remain well-capitalized, and strengthen their ability to continue creditworthy lending in our home markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In August 2009, we completed an exchange offer in order to increase our common equity capital to
accommodate the more adverse economic and credit scenarios assumed under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (the &#147;SCAP&#148;), as applied to regional banking institutions. With the exchange offer we issued 35.7&nbsp;million new shares
of Common Stock and increased our Tier 1 common equity by $1.4 billion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:1%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In connection with the
public exchange offer, we agreed with the U.S. Treasury to exchange the $935 million senior perpetual preferred stock issued to it pursuant to the TARP Capital Purchase Program for $935 million of newly issued perpetual trust preferred securities,
with the same distribution rate as that of the Preferred Stock. This exchange was completed in August 2009. The trust preferred securities had a distribution rate of 5% until December&nbsp;5, 2013 and 9% thereafter. The warrant initially issued to
the U.S Treasury in connection with the issuance of the Preferred Stock in December 2008 remains outstanding and currently represents 2% of our Common Stock outstanding. </P>

and 2009, we carried out various restructurings plans for our operations in the U.S. mainland to improve our U.S. operations, address credit quality, contain controllable costs, maintain well capitalized ratios and improve capital and liquidity
positions. Most of these plans were successfully completed at the end of 2009. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:5%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">During 2010 the

the consolidation of the Puerto Rico banking market and to pursue strategies to improve the credit quality of its loan portfolio. We entered into an FDIC-assisted transaction involving
Westernbank, which could present additional risks to our business. On April&nbsp;30, 2010, BPPR acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Westernbank from the FDIC in an assisted transaction. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We have also carried out a series of actions to improve our Puerto Rico operations, credit quality and
profitability. During 2009, we implemented cost-cutting measures such as the reduction in hiring and pension plan freezes and the suspension of matching contributions to retirement plans. During 2011, further steps were taken to improve our
profitability, including the implementation of a voluntary employee retirement window at the end of 2011. As a result of this initiative in December 2011, we recorded $15.6 million in pension costs related to 369 employees that were eligible and
elected to participate in the retirement program. The retirement was effective on January&nbsp;31, 2012. Also, during 2011 the Corporation executed sales of $457 million (unpaid principal balance) non-performing mortgage loans at BPNA and $358
million in unpaid principal balance of construction and commercial real estate loans at BPPR as part of its de-risking strategy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We have continued to look for synergies and efficiencies within our operations. On December 2012,
Popular Mortgage, Inc. was merged into Banco Popular. This consolidation, among other things, resulted in cost savings for the Corporation. For the year 2013, FDIC deposit insurance expense was $25.2 million lower than for 2012, including a credit
of $11.3 million received during the first quarter. This reduction was also attributed to a lower volume of higher risk assets, after completion of the non-performing assets sales during the year. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">During 2013, the Corporation continued to look for opportunities to strengthen its capital structure and
de-risk its balance sheet. The Corporation monetized part of its investment in EVERTEC by participating as a selling stockholder in EVERTEC&#146;s public offerings. The Corporation recorded an after tax gain of $413 million as a result of these
transactions, as discussed above. BPPR completed sales of assets with a book value of $944 million, most of which were in non-performing status. Coupled with loss mitigation strategies and aggressive resolution of non-performing loans, the
Corporation was able to reduce its non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, by $1.1 billion from December&nbsp;31, 2012. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">On October&nbsp;18, 2013, the Corporation submitted a formal application to the Federal Reserve of New
York to redeem the $935 million in trust preferred securities due under the TARP. While there can be no assurance that the Corporation will be approved to repay TARP, nor on the timing of this event, if the Corporation is approved and repays TARP in
full, a non-cash charge to earnings would be recorded for the unamortized portion of the discount associated with this debt, which at December&nbsp;31, 2013 had a balance of $404 million. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The financial services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. In Puerto Rico, our primary market, the
banking business is highly competitive with respect to originating loans, acquiring deposits and providing other banking services. Most of our direct competition for our products and services comes from commercial banks. The principal competitors
for BPPR include locally based commercial banks and a few large U.S. and foreign banks with assets between $2 billion and $13 billion as of December&nbsp;31, 2013. On April&nbsp;30, 2010, the FDIC closed three commercial banks and entered into
loss-share purchase and assumption agreements with three other commercial banks with operations in Puerto Rico, including us with respect to Westernbank Puerto Rico. Those transactions involved the acquisition of most of the assets and liabilities
of the closed banks, including the assumption of all of the non-brokered deposits. While these transactions have reduced the number of banking competitors in Puerto Rico, they have allowed some of our competitors to gain greater resources, such as a
broader range of products and services. On December&nbsp;18, 2012, there was another banking consolidation in Puerto Rico when Oriental Financial Group, a locally based financial institution, acquired the Puerto Rico operations of Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria S.A. (BBVA), a foreign bank. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, there were 9 commercial banks operating in Puerto Rico. </P>

same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those competitors include brokerage houses, mortgage companies, insurance companies, credit unions (locally known as &#147;cooperativas&#148;), credit card companies,

pricing, convenience of branch locations and other delivery methods, range of products offered, and the level of service delivered. We must compete effectively along all these parameters to be successful. We may experience pricing pressure as some
of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. Competition is particularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is very aggressive. Increased competition could require that we increase the rates offered on deposits
or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%; margin-right:2%; text-indent:8%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Economic
factors, along with legislative and technological changes, will have an ongoing impact on the competitive environment within the financial services industry. We work to anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions whether it may be
developing and marketing innovative products and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our products and services, cross-marketing, or providing personalized banking services. We strive to distinguish ourselves from
other community banks and financial services providers in our market place by providing a high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to attract and retain business. However, we can provide no assurance as to the effectiveness of these
efforts on our future business or results of operations, as to our continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, and as to sufficiently improving our services and/or banking products in order to successfully compete in our

holding companies that have total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The proposed remediation rules are modeled after the prompt corrective action regime, described below, but are
designed to require action beginning in the earlier stages of a company&#146;s financial distress by mandating action on the basis of arranged triggers, including capital and leverage, stress test results, liquidity and risk management. The Proposed
SIFI Rules&#146; requirements generally will become effective on the first day of the fifth calendar quarter after the effective date of the final rule, although certain requirements have different transition periods. Although by their terms most of
the Proposed SIFI Rules&#146; requirements apply only to bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, the Proposed SIFI Rules require bank holding companies and member banks with more than $10 billion in total
consolidated assets to conduct their own annual stress tests and publish a summary of the results of the stress tests. In addition, it is possible that the Federal Reserve may determine in the future to apply some or all of the Proposed SIFI Rules
to smaller bank holding companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In October 2012, the Federal Reserve Board issued final rules implementing the requirements of
Section&nbsp;165(i)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act concerning supervisory stress tests to be conducted by the Federal Reserve Board (the &#147;Annual Supervisory Stress Test Rule&#148;) and Section&nbsp;165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding
semi-annual company-run stress tests (the &#147;Semi-Annual Company-Run Stress Test Rule,&#148; and, together with the Annual Supervisory Stress Test Rule, the &#147;Stress Test Rules&#148;). The Stress Test Rules, effective on November&nbsp;15,
2012, apply to bank holding companies with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Concurrent with the Stress Test Rules, the Federal Reserve
Board issued final rules implementing other requirements of Section&nbsp;165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding annual company-run stress tests (the &#147;Annual Company-Run Stress Test Rules&#148;). The Annual Company-Run Stress Test Rules,
effective on November&nbsp;15, 2012, apply to, bank holding companies with average total consolidated assets of greater than $10 billion but less than $50 billion and any state member bank that has average total consolidated assets of more than $10
billion. The Stress Test Rules and the Annual Company-Run Stress Test Rules set forth, among other things, the requirements on the methodology and scenarios for the stress tests and related publication requirements. On November&nbsp;1, 2013, the
Federal Reserve Board released the supervisory scenarios that will be used in the next round of stress tests. On November&nbsp;7, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final policy statement describing the processes it will use to develop
scenarios for future capital planning and stress testing exercises. This policy statement became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2014. </P>

issued a supervisory guidance regarding stress-testing practices at banking organizations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion. The guidance outlined general principles for a satisfactory stress testing framework and described how
stress testing should be used at various levels within an organization. The guidance also discussed the importance of stress testing in capital and liquidity planning, and the importance of strong internal governance and controls in an effective
stress-testing framework. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">On February&nbsp;18, 2014, the Federal Reserve Board issued final rules (&#147;Final SIFI Rules&#148;)
strengthening supervision and regulation of large U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations. The Final SIFI Rules established a number of enhanced prudential standards for large U.S. bank holding companies to help increase the
resiliency of their operations. These standards include liquidity, risk management, and capital. For U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, the Final SIFI Rules incorporate the previously issued capital
planning and stress testing requirements as an enhanced prudential standard. The Final SIFI Rules also require such a U.S. bank holding company to comply with enhanced risk-management and liquidity risk-management standards, conduct liquidity stress
tests, and hold a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs during a 30-day stress event. In addition, the Final SIFI Rules require publicly traded U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or
more to establish enterprise-wide risk committees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, Popular had total consolidated assets of $35.7

will be deemed to be (1)&nbsp;well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and is not subject to any written agreement or
directive to meet a specific capital level; (2)&nbsp;adequately capitalized, if it is not well capitalized, but maintains a leverage ratio of at least 4% (or at least 3% if given the highest regulatory rating in its most recent report of examination
and not experiencing or anticipating significant growth), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%; (3)&nbsp;undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized

FDIC generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be
undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit
capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount

succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. </P>

measures for four of the five prompt corrective action categories to reflect the New Capital Rules&#146; changes to the minimum risk-based capital ratios. All insured depository institutions must comply with the revised prompt corrective action

payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository institution. In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital

financial distress at such subsidiaries. The source-of-strength amendments in Section&nbsp;616 took effect on July&nbsp;21, 2011, and the appropriate federal banking agencies were required to jointly adopt implementing regulations not later than one
year after that date. To date, however, the federal banking agencies have not proposed any regulations to implement Section&nbsp;616. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was no explicit authority in the BHC Act for the source of strength provision in

funding for the holding companies have included dividends received from their banking and non-banking subsidiaries, asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of medium-term notes, junior subordinated debentures and equity. Various statutory
provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all
dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income (as reportable in its Report of Condition and Income) for that year, combined with its retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the
preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its
Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the
Federal Reserve Board. Subject to the Federal Reserve&#146;s ability to establish more stringent specific requirements under its supervisory or enforcement authority, at December&nbsp;31, 2013, BPPR could have declared a dividend of approximately
$504 million. However, on July&nbsp;25, 2011, PIHC and BPPR entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico that requires the approval
of these entities prior to the payment of any dividends by BPPR to PIHC. BPNA could not declare any dividends without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. </P>

Act&#148;) created a single DIF, increased the maximum amount of FDIC insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts, and provided for possible &#147;inflation adjustments&#148; in the maximum amount of coverage available with respect to other
insured accounts. Under the Reform Act, the FDIC made significant changes to its risk-based assessment system so that effective January&nbsp;1, 2007, the FDIC imposed insurance premiums based upon a matrix that is designed to more closely tie what
banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (&#147;EESA&#148;)
temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. Section&nbsp;335 of the Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 standard maximum limit for federal deposit insurance. In addition,
from December&nbsp;31, 2010 until January&nbsp;1, 2013, Section&nbsp;335 provided temporary unlimited federal deposit insurance protection for non-interest bearing transaction accounts that are payable on demand at insured depository institutions.

the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act). Section&nbsp;334 also raised the statutorily required floor for the DIF from 1.15&nbsp;% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35&nbsp;% of estimated insured deposits, or a comparable percentage of the revised
assessment base required by the Dodd-Frank Act, which is based on average total assets less average tangible equity. Section&nbsp;334 required the FDIC to take the steps necessary for the DIF to meet this revised reserve ratio by September&nbsp;30,

Plan&#148;) for the DIF to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September&nbsp;30, 2020, as required by Section&nbsp;334 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Restoration Plan, the FDIC has foregone the uniform three-basis point increase
in initial assessment rates previously scheduled to take place on January&nbsp;1, 2011. On December&nbsp;14, 2010, the FDIC adopted a final rule, which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2011, to set the DIF&#146;s designated reserve ratio at 2% of
estimated insured deposits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">As required by Sections 331 and 332 of the Dodd-Frank Act, on February&nbsp;7, 2011, the FDIC adopted a
final rule relating to deposit insurance assessment base, assessment rate adjustments, deposit insurance assessment rates, dividends, and large bank pricing methodology, which became effective on April&nbsp;1, 2011. Under the final rule, the
assessment base for an insured depository institution is the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution minus the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period. Prior to April&nbsp;1, 2011, only
deposits payable in the United States were included in determining the premium paid by an institution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The Deposit Insurance Funds
Act of 1996 separated the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;) assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the DIF assessment. The amount assessed on individual institutions by the FICO is in addition to the amount paid for

capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions. Because the capital requirements must be the same for insured depository institutions and their holding companies, the Collins Amendment excludes trust preferred securities from
Tier 1 capital, subject to phase-out from Tier 1 qualification for trust preferred securities issued before May&nbsp;19, 2010, with the phase-out commencing on January&nbsp;1, 2013 and to be implemented &#147;incrementally&#148; over a three-year

Popular, BPPR and BPNA, as compared to the current U.S. general risk-based capital rules. The New Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking
institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios. The New Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing general risk-weighting
approach, which was derived from the Basel Committee&#146;s 1988 &#147;Basel I&#148; capital accords, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the &#147;standardized approach&#148; in the Basel Committee&#146;s 2004 &#147;Basel
II&#148; capital accords. In addition, the New Capital Rules implement certain provisions of Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section&nbsp;939A to remove references to credit ratings from the federal agencies&#146; rules. The New

will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Thus, when fully phased-in on January&nbsp;1, 2019, Popular, BPPR and BPNA will be required to maintain such additional capital
conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i)&nbsp;CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii)&nbsp;Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii)&nbsp;Total capital to risk-weighted

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The New Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These
include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial
entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In addition, under the current general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss
(&#147;AOCI&#148;) items included in shareholders&#146; equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available for sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to
the New Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including Popular, BPPR and BPNA, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. This
election must be made concurrently with the first filing of certain of the Popular&#146;s, BPPR&#146;s and BPNA&#146;s periodic regulatory reports in the beginning of 2015. Popular, BPPR and BPNA expect to make this election in order to avoid
significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities portfolio. The New Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred
securities, from inclusion in bank holding companies&#146; Tier 1 capital, subject to phase-out in the case of bank holding companies that had $15 billion or more in total consolidated assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. The Corporation&#146;s Tier
I capital level at December&nbsp;31, 2013, included $ 427&nbsp;million of trust preferred securities that are subject to the phase-out provisions of the New Capital Rules. The Corporation would be allowed to include only 25 percent of such trust
preferred securities in Tier 1 capital as of January&nbsp;1, 2015 and 0 percent as of January&nbsp;1, 2016, and thereafter. Trust preferred securities no longer included in Popular&#146;s Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of
Tier&nbsp;2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out and irrespective of whether such securities otherwise meet the revised definition of Tier 2 capital set forth in the New Capital Rules. The Corporation&#146;s trust preferred securities
issued to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 are exempt from the phase-out provision. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 will begin on January&nbsp;1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a 4-year

January&nbsp;1, until it reaches 2.5% on January&nbsp;1, 2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">With respect to BPPR and BPNA, the New Capital Rules revise the
&#147;prompt corrective action&#148; (&#147;PCA&#148;) regulations adopted pursuant to Section&nbsp;38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by: (i)&nbsp;introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically
undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii)&nbsp;increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8%
(as compared to the current 6%); and (iii)&nbsp;eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The New Capital Rules do not
change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The New Capital Rules prescribe a new standardized approach
for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, and resulting in
higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We believe that Popular, BPPR and BPNA will be able to meet well-capitalized

<P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Under the BHC Act, the activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries have been limited to the business of
banking and activities closely related to banking, and no bank holding company could directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company in the United
States, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, bank holding companies generally have been prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in non-banking activities, unless such activities were found by the
Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act allows bank holding companies whose subsidiary
depository institutions meet management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of nonbanking financial activities than is permissible for bank holding companies that fail to meet those standards,
including securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in nonfinancial companies. In order for a bank holding company to engage in the broader range of activities that are permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (i)&nbsp;all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized (as described above), and well managed and (ii)&nbsp;it must file a declaration with the Federal Reserve Board that it elects to be a
&#147;financial holding company.&#148; In addition, Section&nbsp;606 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that a bank holding company that is a financial holding company and therefore may engage in the expanded financial activities authorized by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act be and remain well-capitalized and well managed. Popular and PNA have elected to be treated as financial holding companies. A depository institution is deemed to be &#147;well managed&#148; if at its most recent inspection,
examination or subsequent review by the appropriate federal banking agency (or the appropriate state banking agency), the depository institution received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; composite rating and at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148;
rating for the management component of the composite rating. If, after becoming a financial holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the capital or managerial requirements for financial holding company status, the company must
enter into a confidential agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve Board may extend the agreement or
may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may discontinue, or divest investments in companies engaged in, activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company.

July&nbsp;21, 2012, the U.S. financial regulatory agencies are required to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined
as hedge funds and private equity funds). In December 2013, Federal regulators adopted final rules to implement the Volcker Rule. The final rules are highly complex, and many aspects of their application remain uncertain. We are continuing to
evaluate the effects of the final rules, but we do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on our operations. Development and monitoring of the required compliance program, however, may require the expenditure of
significant resources and management attention. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to limit and may in certain

Board before acquiring shares of certain financial companies with assets in excess of $10 billion, unless an exception applies. In addition, Section&nbsp;604 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which became effective on July&nbsp;21, 2011, added a new
application requirement before a financial holding company (regardless of its size) may acquire a nonbank company with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, Popular had total consolidated assets of $35.7

of a transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the costs of fraud prevention. On June&nbsp;29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network
exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. The final rule regarding debit card interchange fees became effective on October&nbsp;1, 2011. Under the final rule, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an
electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. Also on June&nbsp;29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board approved an interim final rule that allows for an upward
adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer&#146;s debit card interchange fee if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set out in the interim final rule. The

United States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the reserve requirements of Section 16. Pursuant to
an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated November&nbsp;24, 1982, BPPR has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, BPPR is subject to the reserve

BPPR under this provision was approximately $247 million. In the case of loans which are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the maximum aggregate amount is increased to one third of the paid-in capital of the
bank, plus its reserve fund. If the institution is well capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the Office of the Commissioner or any regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15% of 50% of its
undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided profits. Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination
may include this additional component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section&nbsp;17 on the amount of loans that are wholly secured by bonds,
securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or instrumentalities of Puerto Rico. </P>

operations and capital position. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that

<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify"><B>Weakness in the economy and in the real estate market in our geographic footprint has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us.
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Popular is exposed to geographical and government risk. A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is
concentrated in Puerto Rico, which entered into a recession in the second quarter of 2006. The latest figures from the Puerto Rico Planning Board the &#147;Planning Board), released in October 2013, project that Puerto Rico&#146;s real gross
national product for fiscal year 2013 (ended June 30, 2013) neither grew nor declined when compared to the prior fiscal year. For fiscal year 2012 (ended June 30, 2012), the Planning Board&#146;s preliminary reports indicate that the real gross
national product grew by only 0.1%. These were the first years reflecting a stable, but weak economy in Puerto Rico, following a six-year steep decline in economic activity. The Planning Board, however, currently projects that Puerto Rico&#146;s
real gross national product for fiscal year 2014 (ending June 30, 2014) will decline by 0.8%. The Planning Board is expected to publish a new forecast in March 2014 for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, together with revised figures for fiscal year 2012
and the preliminary estimates for fiscal year 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Employment continued to be a weak spot. A reduction in total employment began in
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and has continued consistently through fiscal year 2013 due to the current recession and contractionary fiscal adjustment measures. According to the Household Survey (conducted by the Puerto Rico Department of
Labor and Human Resources), the number of persons employed in Puerto Rico during fiscal year 2013 averaged 1,029,019, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the previous fiscal year; and the unemployment rate averaged 14.0%. During the first six months of
fiscal year 2014 (June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2013), total employment fell by 2%, as compared to the same period for the prior fiscal year, and the unemployment rate averaged 14.8% compared to 14.2% for the same period of the prior fiscal
year. Puerto Rico&#146;s fiscal situation is expected to continue to be challenging in 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In February 2014, the three principal
rating agencies (Moody&#146;s, S&amp;P and Fitch) lowered their ratings on the general obligation bonds of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and on the bonds of several other Commonwealth instrumentalities to non-investment grade ratings. In
connection with their rating actions, the rating agencies have noted various factors, including high levels of public debt, the lack of clear economic growth catalysts, fiscal budget deficits, the financial condition of the public sector employee
pension plans and, more recently, liquidity concerns regarding the Commonwealth and Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico and concerns regarding access to market financing.. Furthermore, the Puerto Rico economy continues to be susceptible to
fluctuations in the price of crude oil due to its high dependence on fuel oil for energy production. Popular&#146;s assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 42, &#147;Segment
Reporting&#148; to consolidated financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The Government recently announced that it will take additional measures to
reduce the budget deficit for fiscal year 2014 and is committed to achieving a balanced budget by fiscal year 2015. The additional measures the Government must take to reduce or eliminate the budget deficits will include significant measures to
increase revenues and/or reduce expenditures, which could have adverse effects for economic activity. Furthermore, the Commonwealth must access the capital markets to refinance existing debt If the Commonwealth is unable to successfully access the
bond market or obtain alternative sources of financing, or if the adjustment measures result insufficient to address the Commonwealth&#146;s fiscal problems, then the financial condition of the Commonwealth may deteriorate further, which could cause
a further general deterioration of the economy and adversely affect our financial condition and profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The lingering effects
of the prolonged recession are still reflected in limited loan demand, an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on mortgage loans granted in Puerto Rico. If the price of crude oil increases, if global or local economic conditions
worsen or if the Government is unable to access the capital markets and manage its fiscal problems in an orderly manner, those adverse effects could continue or worsen. Any reduction in consumer spending as a result of these issues may also
adversely impact our non-interest revenues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">For additional information regarding the Puerto Rico economy, refer to

are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. Recent economic reports related to the real estate market in Puerto Rico indicate that several sectors of the real estate market are subject to reductions
in value related to general economic conditions. In certain mainland markets like southern Florida, Illinois and California, we have experienced the negative impact associated with low absorption rates and property value adjustments due to
overbuilding. We measure loan impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, which is derived from estimated collateral values, principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration
prices in observed transactions involving similar assets in similar locations, size and supply and demand. An appraisal report is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraisal does not reflect the
amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, </P>

we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, given the current slowdown in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, the properties securing these
loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Construction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential
real estate properties entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to
economic downturns. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, non-covered commercial and construction loans secured by commercial real estate properties, amounted to $6.5 billion or 30% of the total non-covered loan portfolio. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">BPPR has various subsidiaries holding specific assets acquired in satisfaction of loans for real estate development projects. Total
assets of those subsidiaries amounted to $92.1 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, of which $10.8 million or 12% of total assets are foreclosed properties. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, net charge-offs specifically related to values of properties securing our non-covered
construction, commercial, legacy and mortgage loan portfolios totaled $3.9 million, $115.7 million, $1.2 million and $13.7 million, respectively. Continued deterioration on the fair value of real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired
loans would require increases in our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the credit quality of
our construction, commercial and mortgage portfolio see the Credit Risk Management and Loan Quality section of the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis included in the Annual Report. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Market instability and lack of investor confidence have led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease providing funding

resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial markets have adversely affected our industry and our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not expect a material improvement in the financial
environment in the near future. A worsening of these difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing us and others in the financial industry. In particular, we face the following risks in connection with these events: </P>

(&#147;New Capital Rules&#148;) to establish a new comprehensive regulatory capital framework for all U.S. banking organizations. On July&nbsp;9, 2013, the New Capital Rules were approved by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(&#147;OCC&#148;) and (as interim final rules) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;) (together with the Board, the &#147;Agencies&#148;). </P>

December&nbsp;2010 final capital framework referred to as &#147;Basel III&#148; for strengthening international capital standards. The New Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies
and their depository institution subsidiaries, including Popular, BPPR and BPNA, as compared to the current U.S. general risk-based capital rules. The New Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as
address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios. The New Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital
ratios and replace the existing general risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel Committee&#146;s 1988 &#147;Basel I&#148; capital accords, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the &#147;standardized approach&#148;
in the Basel Committee&#146;s 2004 &#147;Basel II&#148; capital accords. In addition, the New Capital Rules implement certain provisions of Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section&nbsp;939A to remove references to credit ratings from
the federal agencies&#146; rules. The New Capital Rules are effective for Popular, BPPR and BPNA on January&nbsp;1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components and other provisions. </P>

(iii)&nbsp;mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv)&nbsp;expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The New Capital Rules also introduce a new &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148;, composed
entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum
but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Thus, when fully phased-in on January&nbsp;1, 2019, Popular, BPPR and BPNA will be required to
maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i)&nbsp;CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii)&nbsp;Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and
(iii)&nbsp;Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The New Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from
and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments
in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In addition, under the current general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss
(&#147;AOCI&#148;) items included in shareholders&#146; equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available for sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to
the New Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including Popular, BPPR and BPNA, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. This
election must be made concurrently with the first filing of certain of the Popular&#146;s, BPPR&#146;s and BPNA&#146;s periodic regulatory reports in the beginning of 2015. Popular, BPPR and BPNA expect to make this election in order to avoid
significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities portfolio. The New Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred
securities, from inclusion in bank holding companies&#146; Tier 1 capital, subject to phase-out in the case of bank holding companies that had $15 billion or more in total consolidated assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. The Corporation&#146;s Tier
I capital level at December&nbsp;31 2013, included $ 427&nbsp;million of trust preferred securities that are subject to the phase-out provisions of the New Capital Rules. The Corporation would be allowed to include only 25 percent of such trust
preferred securities in Tier 1 capital as of January&nbsp;1, 2015 and 0 percent as of January&nbsp;1, 2016, and thereafter. Trust preferred securities no longer included in Popular&#146;s Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of
Tier&nbsp;2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out and irrespective of whether such securities otherwise meet the revised definition of Tier 2 capital set forth in the New Capital Rules. The Corporation&#146;s trust preferred securities
issued to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 are exempt from the phase-out provision. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 will begin on January&nbsp;1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a 4-year
period (beginning at 40% on January&nbsp;1, 2015 and an additional 20%&nbsp;per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January&nbsp;1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increase by 0.625% on each subsequent
January&nbsp;1, until it reaches 2.5% on January&nbsp;1, 2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">With respect to BPPR and BPNA, the New Capital Rules revise the
&#147;prompt corrective action&#148; (&#147;PCA&#148;) regulations adopted pursuant to Section&nbsp;38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by: (i)&nbsp;introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically
undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii)&nbsp;increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8%
(as compared to the current 6%); and (iii)&nbsp;eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The New Capital Rules do not
change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The New Capital Rules prescribe a new standardized approach
for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, and resulting in
higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We believe that Popular, BPPR and BPNA will be able to meet well-capitalized
capital ratios upon implementation of the revised requirements, as finalized. Although we expect to continue to exceed the minimum requirements for well capitalized status following the implementation of the rules as proposed, there can be no
assurances that we will remain well capitalized. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify"><B>The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure
to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other
institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at
prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. We request collateral for most credit exposures
with other financial institutions and monitor these on a regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by us and results in losses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Our ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when market confidence is affected by events related
to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion among participants may increase, substantially and makes it more difficult to borrow in the credit markets. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B>We are subject to risk related to our own credit rating </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The Corporation&#146;s banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking
subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. The banking subsidiaries had $19 million in deposits at December&nbsp;31, 2013 that were subject to rating triggers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Some of the Corporation&#146;s derivative instruments include financial covenants tied to the bank&#146;s well-capitalized status and
certain formal regulatory actions. These agreements could require exposure collateralization, early termination or both. The fair value of derivative instruments in a liability position subject to financial covenants approximated $15 million at
December&nbsp;31, 2013, with the Corporation providing collateral totaling $19 million to cover the net liability position with counterparties on these derivative instruments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In addition, certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that BPPR has with third parties include rating covenants. In the event
of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Also, the Corporation services
residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require the Corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institution&#146;s required credit ratings are not maintained.
Collateral pledged by the Corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately $120 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013. The Corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that it
would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation&#146;s liquidity resources and impact its operating
results. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Our credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009, and our senior unsecured ratings are now &#147;non-investment
grade&#148; with the three major rating agencies. This may make it more difficult for the Corporation and its subsidiaries to borrow in the capital markets and at a higher cost. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B>We are subject to default risk in our loan portfolio </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans originated or acquired. We establish
provisions for loan losses, which lead to reductions in the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio
in accordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic and market
conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay the loans. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to increase the provision for loan losses
in the future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons beyond our control. Any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any loan losses in excess of our provisions for loan losses would have an adverse
effect on our future financial condition and result of operations. We will continue to evaluate our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and may be required to increase such amounts. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify"><B>Rating downgrades on the Government of Puerto Rico&#146;s debt obligations could affect the value of our
loans to the Government and our portfolio of Puerto Rico Government securities. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In February 2014, the three principal nationally
recognized rating agencies (Moody&#146;s, S&amp;P and Fitch) downgraded the general-obligation bonds of the Commonwealth and other obligations of Puerto Rico instrumentalities to non-investment grade categories, citing concerns about financial
flexibility and a reduced capacity to borrow in the financial markets. Debt from the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA) retained an investment grade following the downgrades. The lower credit ratings of Puerto Rico will likely
reduce the government&#146;s ability to finance its estimated budget deficit for fiscal year 2014 (which the Government announced it intends to reduce from $820 million to $650 million). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The value of Puerto Rico&#146;s government obligations was already adversely impacted during 2013 as a result of prior rating downgrades
and the perceived deterioration of the Government&#146;s fiscal condition. It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential further ratings downgrade of Puerto Rico&#146;s debt obligations. However, further deterioration in the
fiscal situation with possible negative ratings implications, could further adversely affect the value of Puerto Rico&#146;s government obligations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">At December 31, 2013, the Corporation&#146;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, instrumentalities and municipalities amounted
$1.2 billion, of which approximately $950 million is outstanding. Of the amount outstanding, $789 million consists of loans and $161 million are securities. From this amount, $527 million represents obligations from the Government of Puerto Rico and
public corporations that are either collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues identified for their repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans to public corporations that
obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as water and electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from the central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from it.
The credit ratings of the public power and water utilities have also been reduced to non-investment grade categories by some of the rating agencies as part of the recent downgrades. The remaining $423 million represents obligations from various
municipalities in Puerto Rico for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment. These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in
such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all of its general obligation bonds and loans. These loans have seniority to the payment of operating cost and expenses of the municipality. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In addition, at December 31, 2013, the Corporation had $360 million in indirect exposure to loans or securities that are payable by
non-governmental entities, but which carry a government guarantee to cover any shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. These included $274 million in residential mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance
Authority (December 31, 2012 - $294 million). These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. Also, the Corporation had $52 million in
Puerto Rico pass-through housing bonds backed by FNMA, GNMA or residential loans CMO&#146;s, and $34 million of industrial development notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify"><B>We
are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into
a mortgage-backed security. In the past, we have retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December&nbsp;31, 2013, we serviced
$2.5 billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with FNMA and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, we are required to
repurchase the loan or reimburse the third party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is
equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2013, we repurchased approximately $126 million in mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse provisions. In
the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or
serviced with credit recourse amounted to $41 million. We may suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan
plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property. </P>

these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan, and be unsaleable or saleable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance,
we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes
that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market&#146;s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize
repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resulting from representation and warranty
violations on specific portfolios. At December&nbsp;31, 2013, Popular&#146;s reserve for estimated losses from representation and warranty arrangements amounted to $26.3 million, which was included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">During 2008 and continuing in 2009, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted
the DIF. In addition, the FDIC instituted two temporary programs, to further insure customer deposits at FDIC-member banks: deposit accounts are now insured up to $250,000 per customer (up from $100,000) and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts
are fully insured (unlimited coverage) as a result of our participation in the Transaction Account Guarantee Program. These programs have placed additional stress on the DIF. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the DIF, the FDIC increased assessment rates of insured
institutions uniformly by 7 cents for every $100 of deposits beginning with the first quarter of 2009, with additional changes in April&nbsp;1, 2009, which required riskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate
adjustments based on, among other things, secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels. In May 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule, effective June&nbsp;30, 2009, that imposed a special assessment of 5 cents for every $100 on each insured depository
institution&#146;s assets minus its Tier 1 capital as of June&nbsp;30, 2009, subject to a cap equal to 10 cents per $100 of assessable deposits for the second quarter 2009 risk-based capital assessment. This special assessment applied to us and
resulted in a $16.7 million expense in our second quarter of 2009. On November&nbsp;12, 2009, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring banks to prepay three years&#146; worth of premiums to replenish its depleted insurance fund. In December&nbsp;30, 2009,
Popular prepaid $221 million and reduced our year-end liquidity at our banking subsidiaries. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">With the enactment of the Dodd-Frank
Act, major changes were introduced to the FDIC deposit insurance system. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC now has until the end of September 2020 to bring its reserve ratio to the new statutory minimum of 1.35%. New rules amending the deposit
insurance assessment regulations under the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act have been adopted, including a final rule designating 2% as the designated reserve ratio and a final rule extending temporary unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest
bearing transaction accounts maintained in connection with lawyers&#146; trust accounts. On February&nbsp;7, 2011, the FDIC adopted regulations effective for the 2011 second quarter assessment and payable in September 2011, which outline significant
changes in the risk-based premiums approach for banks with over $10 billion of assets and creates a &#147;Scorecard&#148; system. The &#147;Scorecard&#148; system uses a performance score and loss severity score, which aggregate to an initial base

amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances,

goodwill during the third quarter of 2013 using July&nbsp;31, 2013 as the annual evaluation date. This evaluation is a two- step process. The Step 1 evaluation of goodwill allocated to BPNA, our United States operations segment, indicated potential
impairment of goodwill. The Step 1 fair value for the unit was below the carrying amount of its equity book value as of the July&nbsp;31, 2013 valuation date, requiring the completion of Step 2. Step 2 required a valuation of all assets and
liabilities of the BPNA unit, including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets, to determine the fair value of net assets. To complete Step 2, we subtracted from the unit&#146;s Step 1 fair value the determined fair value of the net
assets to arrive at the implied fair value of goodwill. The results of the Step 2 analysis indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the goodwill carrying value of $402 million, resulting in no goodwill impairment. </P>

since we are one of only two institutions in Puerto Rico that received TARP money and are subject to TARP related compensation provisions. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be

principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage excessive risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and
soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively
identify and manage risks, be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. The proposal also contemplates a detailed review by the Federal Reserve Board of the incentive
compensation policies and practices of a number of &#147;large, complex banking organizations.&#148; Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can
affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The proposal provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance
processes pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. Separately, the FDIC has solicited comments on whether to amend its risk-based
deposit insurance assessment system to potentially increase assessment rates on financial institutions with compensation programs that put the FDIC deposit insurance fund at risk, and proposed legislation would subject compensation practices at
financial institutions to heightened standards and increased scrutiny. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators&#146;

subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include capitalizing subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and BPNA, are limited by law in their ability to
make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of
operation and financial position. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business, may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">Actions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to

liquid than for investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand to complete a transaction and the cost could
be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">In addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below
well-capitalized could affect our relationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit counterparties to either request
additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based on our below investment grade ratings. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements
with substitute counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. In addition, servicing, licensing and custodial
agreements that we are party to with third parties include ratings covenants. Servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans. Upon failure to maintain the required credit
ratings, the third parties could have the right to require Popular to engage a substitute fund custodian and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse
provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $120 million at
December&nbsp;31, 2013. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under

are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below investment

Corporation to develop strategic plans to improve earnings and to develop capital plans. The Corporation does not expect the capital plans to require it to maintain capital ratios in excess of those it currently has achieved. The MOUs require the

possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control of the
Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire
Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two -thirds of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have the effect of
making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the
additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might

U.S.- based entities, we and our subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as EVERTEC, are obligated to comply with the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. These regulations prohibit U.S.- based entities from entering into or
facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes and also
prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. Failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes may result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed
on us. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business involving sanctioned countries or entities, and this could adversely
affect the market for our securities. For these reasons, we have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. EVERTEC has also done this. These
policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctioned-country and persons involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties in identifying all transactions of our customers&#146; customers
that may involve a sanctioned country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable U.S. laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our

voluntary self-disclosure to OFAC regarding the processing of certain Cuba related credit card transactions involving Costa Rica and Venezuela that EVERTEC believed could not be rejected under governing local law and policies, but which nevertheless
may have not been consistent with the CACR. The voluntary self-disclosure also covered the transmission, through EVERTEC&#146;s Costa Rica subsidiary, of data relating to debit card payment initiated by non-sanctioned persons traveling to Cuba.
Notwithstanding the risk of violations of applicable governing local law and policies, around September 2010, EVERTEC ceased processing the credit card transactions and transmitting the data referred to in the two preceding sentences. </P>

from merchants in Cuba routed by Tarjetas y Transacciones en Red, TRANRED, C.A. (&#147;Tranred&#148;), which at the time was our subsidiary, on behalf of a Venezuelan bank customer. Because Tranred understood its Venezuelan customers issued debit
cards for local Venezuelan transactions only, Tranred had not established screening for debit card transactions. Immediately upon discovery of the Cuba-originating transactions, Tranred implemented a new control filter in its debit card transaction
routing system to prevent the routing of any transaction originating in Cuba. On July&nbsp;31, 2013, Popular completed the sale of Tranred to a third party. </P>

required by the ITR. The transactions related to a non-profit corporation client of Banco Popular which owns and operates a full service television network.&nbsp;The transactions, which related to payment for air-time on the television network by a
public broadcasting entity that appeared to be directly or indirectly owned, controlled and/or operated by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (&#147;IRIB&#148;), Iran&#146;s state-owned public broadcasting corporation, and, consequently,

matters set forth above, from time to time we have identified and voluntarily self-disclosed to OFAC transactions that were not timely identified and blocked by our policies and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the economic
sanctions regulations administered by OFAC, including the CACR. Although OFAC&#146;s response to our recent voluntary self-disclosures of these apparent violations has been to issue cautionary letters to us, there can be no assurances that our

estate loan and construction loan portfolios represent a larger portion of BPPR&#146;s total loan portfolio than prior to the FDIC-assisted transaction. This type of lending is generally considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional
single-family residential or consumer lending, because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful operation or completion of the related real estate or construction project. Consequently,
these loans are more sensitive to the current adverse conditions in the real estate market and the general economy. These loans are generally less predictable, more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and their collateral may be more difficult to
dispose of in a market decline. Furthermore, since these loans are to Puerto Rico based borrowers, Popular&#146;s credit exposure concentration in Puerto Rico increased as a result of the acquisition. Although, the negative economic aspects of these
risks are substantially reduced as a result of the FDIC loss sharing agreements, changes in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher loan charge-offs in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction all of which would not be
totally supported by the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">We acquired significant portfolios of loans in the FDIC-assisted

charge-offs on the loan portfolio that we have acquired and correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if

of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In the FDIC-assisted transaction, we recorded a loss share indemnification asset that we consider adequate to absorb future
losses which may occur in the acquired loan portfolio. In determining the size of the loss share indemnification asset, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in
delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic
conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio. Any increase in future loan losses could have a negative effect on our operating results. However, in the event expected losses from the Westernbank portfolio were to increase more
than originally expected, the related increase in loss reserves would be largely offset by higher than expected indemnity payments from the FDIC. Refer to the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction section in the Annual Report for additional

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">For the quarters ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 through March&nbsp;31, 2012, BPPR received
reimbursement for loss-share claims submitted to the FDIC, including charge-offs for certain commercial late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans calculated in accordance with BPPR&#146;s charge-off policy for non-covered assets. When BPPR
submitted its shared-loss claim in connection with the June&nbsp;30, 2012 quarter, however, the FDIC refused to reimburse BPPR for a portion of the claim because of a difference related to the methodology for the computation of charge-offs for
certain commercial late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans. In accordance with the terms of the commercial loss share agreement, BPPR applied a methodology for charge-offs for late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans that conforms
to its regulatory supervisory criteria and is calculated in accordance with BPPR&#146;s charge-off policy for non-covered assets. The FDIC has stated that it believes that BPPR should use a different methodology for those charge-offs.
Notwithstanding the FDIC&#146;s refusal to reimburse BPPR for certain shared-loss claims, BPPR has continued to submit shared-loss claims for quarters subsequent to June&nbsp;30, 2012. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, BPPR had unreimbursed shared-loss
claims of $247.0 million under the commercial loss share agreement with the FDIC. On February&nbsp;14, 2014, BPPR received a payment of $78.9 million related to reimbursable shared-loss claims from the FDIC. After giving effect to this payment, BPPR
has unreimbursed shared-loss claims amounting to $168.1 million, including $158.1 million related to commercial late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans, determined in accordance with BPPR&#146;s regulatory supervisory criteria and
BPPR&#146;s charge-off policy for non-covered assets. If the reimbursement amount for these claims were calculated in accordance with the FDIC&#146;s preferred methodology for late stage real-estate-collateral-dependent loans, the amount of such
claims would be reduced by approximately $144.4 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">BPPR&#146;s loss share agreements with the FDIC specify that disputes can
be submitted to arbitration before a review board under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. On July&nbsp;31, 2013, BPPR filed a statement of claim with the American Arbitration Association requesting that the
review board determine certain matters relating to the loss-share claims under the commercial loss share agreement with the FDIC, including that the review board award BPPR the amounts owed under its unpaid quarterly certificates. The statement of
claim also requests reimbursement of certain valuation adjustments for discounts to appraised values, costs to sell troubled assets and other items. The review board is comprised of one arbitrator appointed by BPPR, one arbitrator appointed by the
FDIC and a third arbitrator selected by agreement of those arbitrators. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:7%; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL" ALIGN="justify">To the extent that we are not able to successfully resolve
this matter through the arbitration process described above, a material difference could result in the timing and amount of charge-offs recorded by us and the amount of charge-offs reimbursed by the FDIC under the commercial loss share agreement.
That could require us to make a material adjustment to the value of our loss share assets and the related true up payment obligation to the FDIC, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which such
adjustment is taken. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:22pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:8pt; font-family:ARIAL"><B>RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES </B></P>
