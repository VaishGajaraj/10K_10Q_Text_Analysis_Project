<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation, PIB and PNA are bank holding companies subject to supervision and regulation
by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. Under the BHC Act, prior to the adoption of the
Gramm Leach Bliley Act in 1999, the activities of bank holding companies and their banking and
non-banking subsidiaries were limited to the business of banking and activities closely related to
banking, and no bank holding company could directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of
more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company in the
United States, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In
addition, bank holding companies generally have been prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in
non-banking activities, unless they were found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related
to banking. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act authorized bank holding companies that qualify as &#147;financial
holding companies&#148; to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking activities, subject to
certain conditions. Effective April&nbsp;30, 2002, the Corporation elected to be treated as a Financial
Holding Company. See &#147;Financial Services
Modernization&#148; below for information regarding changes to these rules.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDIA&#148;) requires, among other things, the federal
banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not
meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital tiers: &#147;well capitalized&#148;,
&#147;adequately capitalized&#148;, &#147;undercapitalized&#148;, &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;, and &#147;critically
undercapitalized&#148;. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies provide that a depository institution will be
deemed to be (1)&nbsp;well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and is

capitalized, but maintains a leverage ratio of at least 4% (or at least 3% if given the highest
regulatory rating and not experiencing or anticipating significant growth), a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of at least 4% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%; (3)
undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized institutions (unless
it is deemed significantly or critically undercapitalized); (4)&nbsp;significantly undercapitalized if
it has a leverage ratio of less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a
total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%; and (5)&nbsp;critically undercapitalized if it has
tangible equity equal to 2% or less of total assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2005, Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. were all well capitalized.
An institution&#146;s capital category, as determined by applying the prompt corrective action
provisions of law, may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition
or prospects of the institution, and the capital condition of the Corporation&#146;s banking
subsidiaries should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the
Corporation&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well
capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The appropriate agency is
also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with
the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a
significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory
information other than the capital levels of the institution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking
agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe
or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution
(including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the
depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository
institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition,
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to
submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the
capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at
the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution
fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without
determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to
succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to
submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly
undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and
restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized,
requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or
conservator.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to FDIC-insured
depository institutions such as Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A., but they are not
directly applicable to holding companies such as the Corporation, PIB and PNA, which control such
institutions. However, the federal banking agencies have indicated that, in regulating holding
companies, they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment
of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions
pursuant to such provisions and regulations.

of its non-banking subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the transferring institution&#146;s capital
stock and surplus. For these purposes an institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus includes its total
risk-based capital plus (1)&nbsp;the balance of its allowance for loan losses not included therein and
(2)&nbsp;the amount of certain investments made by the institution in &#147;financial subsidiaries&#148; that is
required to be deducted from the institution&#146;s capital for regulatory capital purposes.
Furthermore, any such loans and extensions of credit are required to be secured in specified
amounts. In addition, federal law requires that any transaction between Banco Popular, BPNA or
Banco Popular, N.A., on the one hand, and the Corporation, PIB, PNA or any of the Corporation&#146;s
other non-banking subsidiaries, on the other hand, be carried out on an arm&#146;s length basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company such as the Corporation, PIB or
PNA is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to
commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when,
absent such policy, the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support. In
addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository
institutions are subordinated in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of
such subsidiary depository institution. In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any
commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a
subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
priority of payment. Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are currently the only depository
institution subsidiaries of the Corporation, PIB and PNA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Corporation, PIB and PNA are holding companies, their right to participate in the
assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#146;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the
prior claims of the subsidiary&#146;s creditors (including depositors in the case of subsidiary
depository institutions) except to the extent that the Corporation, PIB or PNA, as the case may be,
may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the FDIA, a depository institution, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, can
be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in
connection with (i)&nbsp;the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or
(ii)&nbsp;any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository
institution &#147;in danger of default&#148;. &#147;Default&#148; is defined generally as the appointment of a
conservator or a receiver, and &#147;in danger of default&#148; is defined generally as the existence of
certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory
assistance. Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are currently FDIC-insured depository
institution subsidiaries of the Corporation and are subject to this cross-guarantee liability. In
some circumstances (depending upon the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the
FDIC), cross-guarantee liability may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more
insured depository institutions in a holding company structure. Any obligation or liability owed by
a subsidiary depository institution to its parent company is subordinated to the subsidiary
depository institution&#146;s cross-guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled FDIC-insured
depository institutions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal source of cash flow for the Corporation is dividends from Banco Popular. Various
statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends Banco Popular may pay to the Corporation without
regulatory approval. As a member bank subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board,
Banco Popular must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total

net income (as reportable in its Report of Condition and Income) for that year, combined with its
retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required
transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member
bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments.
Pursuant to the FDIA, the FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system, under which the
assessment rate for an insured depository institution varies according to the level of risk
incurred in its activities. An institution&#146;s risk category is based partly upon whether the
institution is well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized. Each
FDIC-insured depository institution is currently assigned to one of the following &#147;supervisory
subgroups&#148;: &#147;A&#148;, &#147;B&#148; or &#147;C&#148;. Group &#147;A&#148; institutions are financially sound institutions with only a
few minor weaknesses; Group &#147;B&#148; institutions are institutions that demonstrate weaknesses that, if
not corrected, could result in significant deterioration; and Group &#147;C&#148; institutions are
institutions for which there is a substantial probability that the FDIC will suffer a loss in
connection with the institution unless effective action is taken to correct the areas of weakness.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, premiums related to deposits assessed by both the BIF and the Savings Association
Insurance Fund (&#147;SAIF&#148;) are to be assessed at an annual rate of between 0 cents and 27 cents per
$100.00 of deposits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of favorable loss experience and a healthy reserve ratio in the BIF, well capitalized
and well managed banks, including the Corporation&#146;s bank subsidiaries, have in recent years paid no
premiums for FDIC insurance.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;8, 2006 the President signed the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the
&#147;Act&#148;). The Act provides for the merger of the BIF and SAIF into a single Deposit Insurance Fund,
and increase the maximum amount of the insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts, and
possible &#147;inflation adjustments&#148; in the maximum amount of coverage available with respect to other
insured accounts. The FDIC is expected to promulgate implementing regulations in the near future,
under which, even well capitalized and well managed banks may be required to pay premiums on
deposit insurance. It is not possible to determine when any such premiums will become assessable or
the level of such premiums.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 also separated the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;)
assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the BIF and SAIF assessment. The
amount assessed on individual institutions by the FICO is in addition to the amount, if any, paid
for deposit insurance according to the FDIC&#146;s risk-related assessment rate schedules. The current
FICO annual assessment rate is 1.32 cents per $100 of deposits. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Corporation

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and
member banks, the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital (&#147;Total Capital&#148;) to risk-weighted
assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby
letters of credit) is 8%. Under the capital guidelines, a banking
organization&#146;s Total Capital is divided into tiers. &#147;Tier
1 Capital&#148; consists of common equity, retained earnings, minority
interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual
preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock less goodwill and
certain other intangible assets. Not more than 25% of qualifying
Tier 1 Capital may consist of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock,
trust preferred securities or other &#147;so-called&#148; restricted
core capital elements. &#147;Tier 2 Capital&#148; consists of, among
other things, a limited amount
of subordinated debt, other preferred stock, certain other instruments and a limited amount of loan
and lease loss reserves. &#147;Tier 3 Capital&#148; consists of
qualifying unsecured subordinated debt. The sum of Tier 2 and Tier 3
Capital may not exceed the amount of Tier 1 Capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for
bank holding companies and member banks. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1
Capital to total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below (the
&#147;leverage ratio&#148;) of 3% for bank holding companies and member banks that have the highest
regulatory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s market risk capital measure. All
other bank holding companies and member banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of
4%. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making
acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum
supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the guidelines
indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider a &#147;tangible Tier 1 leverage
ratio&#148; and other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new
activities. The tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization&#146;s Tier 1
Capital less all intangibles, to total assets less all intangibles.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to the risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted
by the Federal Reserve Board. Banco Popular, N.A. is subject to substantially similar requirements
of the OCC. See Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 19 &#147;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#148; on
page 92 and 93 for the capital ratios of the Corporation, Banco Popular and BPNA. Failure to meet
capital guidelines could subject the Corporation and its depository institution subsidiaries to a
variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and to
certain restrictions on its business. See &#147;- Prompt Corrective Action&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies&#146; risk-capital guidelines are based upon the 1988
capital accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#147;BSC&#148;). The BSC is a committee
comprised by central bank governors and bank supervisor authorities of the Group of Ten countries
(G10). The BSC is in charge of developing broad policy guidelines used by each country&#146;s supervisor
to determine its own supervisory guidelines. In January&nbsp;2001 the BSC released a proposal to replace
the 1988 capital accord with a new set of guidelines. The new Basel Accord (Basel II) would set for
the first time capital requirements for operational risk and refine the existing capital
requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures. The 1988 capital accord does not include a

from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. The
federal regulatory agencies are expected to release the latest Notice for Proposed Rulemaking (NPR)
and related supervisory guidance by the first quarter of 2006. Under the current timeline, Basel II
is expected to be adopted by mandatory and opt-in banks beginning January&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basel II is still under revision in response to industry, national and regulatory
commentaries. Factors such as the capital charge for addressing operational risk are still
undergoing changes. In addition, in 2005 federal regulatory banking agencies proposed a revised
version of the current capital accord (Basel IA). This proposal is expected to correct material
differences between financial institutions adopting Basel II and those institutions remaining under
the current regulatory capital regime. The Corporation is closely monitoring the implementation
process of these regulatory proposals, and will assess their impact on minimum capital requirements
once finalized. The Corporation expects that a new capital accord will eventually be adopted by the
BSC and enforced by the federal banking agencies. In the meantime, the Corporation continues to
work towards the adoption of a new capital framework, and comply with requirements set by federal
regulatory agencies. At this time the Corporation cannot determine with certainty whether the
capital requirements that may arise out of a new Basel Accord will increase or decrease minimum
capital requirements applicable to the Corporation and its subsidiaries.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, issuer trusts that issued trust preferred securities have been consolidated by
their parent companies and the accounts of such issuer trusts have been included in the
consolidated financial statements of such parent companies. In addition, trust preferred securities
have been treated as eligible for Tier 1 capital treatment by bank holding companies under Federal
Reserve rules and regulations relating to minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated
subsidiaries. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, $824,000,000 in trust preferred securities that the
Corporation treated as Tier 1 capital under existing Federal Reserve Board guidelines were
outstanding. The Corporation has determined that the issuer trusts for its trust preferred

limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies
(BHCs). Under the final rule, trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements
will be subject to stricter quantitative limits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s final rule limits restricted core capital elements to 25&nbsp;percent
of all core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability.
Internationally active BHCs, defined as those with consolidated assets greater than $250&nbsp;billion or
on-balance-sheet foreign exposure greater than $10&nbsp;billion, will be subject to a 15&nbsp;percent limit.
They may, however, include qualifying mandatory convertible preferred securities up to the
generally applicable 25&nbsp;percent limit. Amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of
these limits generally may be included in Tier 2 capital. The final rule provides a five-year
transition period, ending March&nbsp;31, 2009, for application of the quantitative limits.

interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish or acquire additional branches at any
location in the state where any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have
established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. A bank that has established
a branch in a state through de novo branching (if permitted under state laws) may establish and
acquire additional branches in such state in the same manner and to the same extent as a bank
having a branch in such state as a result of an interstate merger. If a state opted out of
interstate branching within the specified time period, no bank in any other state may establish a
branch in the state that has opted out, whether through an acquisition or de novo. A foreign bank,
like Banco Popular, may establish branches interstate, by merger or de novo, to the same extent as
a domestic bank in the foreign bank&#146;s home state, which, in the case of Banco Popular, is New York.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was enacted on November&nbsp;12, 1999. Among other things, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: (i)&nbsp;allows bank holding companies whose subsidiary depository institutions
meet management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially
broader range of nonbanking activities than was previously permissible, including insurance
underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies; (ii)
allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks; (iii)&nbsp;removes various
restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and
mutual fund advisory companies; and (iv)&nbsp;establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to
bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations. This part of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act became effective on March&nbsp;11, 2000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a bank holding company to engage in the broader range of activities that are
permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (i)&nbsp;all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be
well capitalized (as described above) and well managed and (ii)&nbsp;it must file a declaration with
the Federal Reserve that it elects to be a &#147;financial holding company.&#148; A depository institution is
deemed to be &#147;well managed&#148; if at its most recent inspection, examination or subsequent review by
the appropriate federal banking agency (or the appropriate state banking agency), the depository
institution received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; composite rating and at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148;
rating for management. In addition, to commence any new activity permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and to acquire any company engaged in any new activities permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding
company must have received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating in its most recent examination under
the Community Reinvestment Act.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election by the Corporation, PIB and PNA to become financial holding companies became
effective April&nbsp;30, 2002.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also modified other laws, including laws related to financial
privacy and community reinvestment. The new financial privacy provisions generally prohibit
financial institutions, including the Corporation&#146;s bank subsidiaries, from disclosing nonpublic
personal financial information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to &#147;opt out&#148;
of the disclosure.

Laundering Initiative and the USA PATRIOT Act</B>
</DIV>



<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;26, 2001, the President signed into law comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation
known as the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;). Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act
substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing
significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and
expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Treasury Department (the &#147;Treasury&#148;) has issued a number of regulations implementing
the USA PATRIOT Act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions, including the
Corporation&#146;s bank subsidiaries. The regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions
to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money
laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of
customers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act&#146;s requirements could
have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. The Corporation believes that
the cost of compliance with Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act is not likely to be material to the
Corporation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to help serve the credit needs of their
communities, including credit to low and moderate income individuals and geographies. Should the
Corporation or its bank subsidiaries fail to serve adequately the community, potential penalties
may include regulatory denials of applications to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and
affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or purchase other financial
institutions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Legislative Initiatives</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various other legislative proposals, including proposals to limit the investments that a
depository institution may make with FDIC insured funds, are from time to time introduced in
Congress. The Corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that such potential legislation, if
enacted, or implementing regulations would have upon its financial condition or results of
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;22, 2004, President George W. Bush signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004, which lowers the withholding tax rate imposed on distributions of U.S. sourced dividends
to a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico from 30% to 10%. The
Corporation&#146;s foreign subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently invested. Accordingly, the
new law which lowered the withholding tax rate to 10% is not expected to have an impact in the
Corporation&#146;s earnings in the foreseeable future.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Puerto Rico Regulation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>General. </I></B>As a commercial bank organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, Banco Popular is
subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial
Institutions of Puerto Rico (the &#147;Office of the Commissioner&#148;), pursuant to the Puerto Rico
Banking Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Banking Law&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the yearly net
income of Banco Popular be credited annually to a reserve fund. This apportionment must be done
every year until the reserve fund is equal to the total of paid-in capital on common and preferred
stock. At the end of 2005 Banco Popular transferred $31&nbsp;million to the reserve fund in order to
comply with this requirement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater
than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the
undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve
fund. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the
outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared
until capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original
capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve that, except as
otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less than 20% of its demand
liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by
collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a state of the United
States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that
state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the
reserve requirements of Section&nbsp;16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated
November&nbsp;24, 1982, Banco Popular has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal
Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, Banco Popular is
subject to the reserve requirements prescribed by the Banking Law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to any one person, firm,

approximately $110.7&nbsp;million. The above limitations do not apply to loans which are secured by
collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan up to a maximum aggregate amount of
one third of the paid-in capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the institution is well
capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the Office of the
Commissioner or any regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15% of 50% of its
undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of
the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided profits.
Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional component in
their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner.
There are no restrictions under Section&nbsp;17 on the amount of loans that are wholly secured by bonds,
securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United States or Puerto

Rico.

activities directly or through subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal property,
originating and servicing mortgage loans and operating a small loan company. Banco Popular engages
in these activities through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Popular Auto, Inc., Popular Mortgage,
Inc. and Popular Finance, Inc., respectively, all of which are organized and operate in Puerto
Rico.

President of the Planning Board, and the President of the Government Development Bank for Puerto
Rico, has the authority to regulate the maximum interest rates and finance charges that may be
charged on loans to individuals and unincorporated businesses in Puerto Rico. The current
regulations of the Finance Board provide that the applicable interest rate on loans to individuals
and unincorporated businesses (including real estate development loans but excluding certain other
personal and commercial loans secured by mortgages on real estate properties and finance charges on
retail installment sales and for credit card purchases) is to be determined by free competition.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2004, the Government of Puerto Rico approved a legislation that partially
eliminates the tax exempt status of IBE that operates as a division or branch of a bank in Puerto
Rico. In order to be subject to tax, the IBE&#146;s net taxable income must exceed 40% in 2004, 30% in
2005, and 20% in 2006 and thereafter, of the net taxable income of the bank as a whole. Once these

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the reorganization of the Corporation&#146;s corporate structure during 2004,
the corporation realigned its business segments to reflect its new business structure, referred to
by management as &#147;business circles&#148;. There is one circle for each of the Corporation&#146;s four
principal businesses &#150; Banco Popular Puerto Rico, Banco Popular North America, Popular Financial
Holdings and EVERTEC. Each business circle has been identified as a reportable segment. Also, a
corporate circle has been defined to support the business circles.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management determined the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate
performance and to assess where to allocate resources. The segments were determined based on the
new organizational structure which focuses primarily towards products and services as well as on
the markets the segments serve. Other factors, such as the credit risk characteristics of the loan
products, distribution channels and clientele, were also considered in the determination of
reportable segments.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Financial results are constantly exposed to market risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the market
value of assets and liabilities due to interest rate volatility. Despite the varied nature of
market risks, the primary source of this risk to the Corporation is the impact of changes in
interest rates on net interest income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated on earning assets and
the interest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics
of the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could either
increase or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structure
of the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature
or reprice in that period. Any mismatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
is known as a gap position. A positive gap denotes asset sensitivity, which means that an increase
in interest rates could have a positive effect on net interest income, while a decrease in interest
rates could have a negative effect on net interest income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Corporation is subject to interest rate risk because of the following factors:
</DIV>

    <TD width="1%">&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at
different times. For example, if assets reprice slower
than liabilities and interest rates are generally
rising, earnings may initially decline.</TD>

    <TD width="1%">&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>Assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by
different amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates is
rising, we may increase rates charged on loans by an amount that is less than
the general increase in market interest rates because of intense pricing
competition. Also, basis risk occurs when assets and liabilities have similar
repricing frequencies but are tied to different market interest rate indices.</TD>

    <TD>The remaining maturity of various assets and liabilities
may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if
long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, mortgage-backed
securities held in the securities available-for-sale portfolio may
prepay significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduce
portfolio income. If prepayment rates increase, the Corporation
would be required to amortize net premiums into income over a
shorter period of time, thereby reducing the corresponding asset
yield and net interest income. Prepayment risk also has a
significant impact on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized
mortgage obligations, since prepayments could shorten the weighted
average life of these portfolios.</TD>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">increases in short-term interest rates could reduce net interest income. Also, if the flattening
slope of the yield curve and current interest rate conditions persist, coupled with intense pricing
competition, the net interest margin could be negatively impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level, management may alter the mix of
floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities through
sales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other
alternatives. The Corporation may suffer losses or experience lower spreads than anticipated in
initial projections as management implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The hedging transactions that the Corporation enters into may not be effective in managing the
exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation uses derivatives, to a limited extent, to manage part of the exposure to
market risk caused by changes in interest rates or basis risk. The derivative instruments that the
Corporation may utilize also have their own risks, which include: (1)&nbsp;basis risk, which is the risk
of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and/or hedge
cost; (2)&nbsp;credit or default risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the
counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder; and (3)&nbsp;legal risk,
which is the risk that the Corporation is unable to enforce certain terms of such instruments. All
or any of such risks could expose the Corporation to losses.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Reductions in the Corporation&#146;s credit ratings or those of any of its subsidiaries would
increase the cost of borrowing funds and make the Corporation&#146;s ability to raise new funds or renew
maturing debt more difficult.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit ratings are an important component of the Corporation&#146;s liquidity profile. Among
other factors, credit ratings are based on the financial strength, the credit quality of and
concentrations in the Corporations&#146; loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital
adequacy, the quality of management, the liquidity of the Corporation&#146;s balance sheet, the
availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to
access a broad array of wholesale funding sources. Changes in the Corporation&#146;s credit ratings or
the credit ratings of any of its subsidiaries to a level below &#147;investment grade&#148; would adversely
affect the Corporation&#146;s ability to raise funds in the capital markets. The Corporation&#146;s
counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade. In the event of a downgrade,
the cost of borrowing funds would increase. In addition, the Corporation&#146;s ability to raise new
funds in the capital markets or renew maturing debt may be more difficult.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits depends
on various factors, including service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by the
operating results and credit ratings by nationally recognized credit agencies. A downgrade in
credit ratings may impact the ability to raise deposits, but the Corporation believes that the
impact should not be material. Deposits at all of its banking subsidiaries are federally insured
(subject to limitations established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), which is
expected to mitigate the effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Corporation&#146;s borrowings and deposits are subject to &#147;rating triggers&#148;, which
are contractual provisions that accelerate the maturity of the underlying obligations in the case
of a change in the ratings. Therefore, the need to raise funds in the marketplace could increase in
the case of a ratings downgrade. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, the Corporation had outstanding $216
million of borrowings subject to rating triggers.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>A failure to comply with financial covenants in contractual agreements could accelerate
payments of related borrowings.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of borrowing from institutional lenders and other investors, the
Corporation has entered into contractual agreements to maintain certain levels of debt, capital and
asset quality, among other financial covenants. Failing to comply with those agreements may result
in an event of default, which could accelerate the repayment of the related borrowings. An event of
default would also affect the Corporation&#146;s ability to raise new funds or renew maturing debt.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The Corporation is subject to default risk in its loan portfolio.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with
respect to the loans originated or acquired. The Corporation establishes provisions for loan
losses, which lead to reductions in the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance
for future loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an
assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures and
guidelines. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future
loan losses or that the Corporation will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in the
future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons beyond our
control.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>A prolonged economic downturn or recession would likely result in an increase in
delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures and in a reduction of the loan origination activity which
would adversely affect the Corporation&#146;s financial results.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A period of reduced economic growth or a recession has historically resulted in a
reduction in lending activity and an increase in the rate of defaults in commercial loans, consumer
loans and residential mortgages. A recession may have a significant adverse impact on the net
interest income and fee income. The Corporation may also experience significant losses on the loan
portfolio due to a higher level of defaults on commercial loans, consumer loans and residential
mortgages.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The Corporation operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by
changes in federal and local laws and regulations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by
federal and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal or Puerto Rico laws
or regulations could have a substantial impact on its operations. Additional laws and regulations
may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect the Corporation&#146;s powers,
authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation&#146;s financial
condition and results of operations. Further, regulators, in the performance of their supervisory
and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and
unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this
regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on the Corporation.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the Corporation&#146;s
profitability.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation faces substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting
deposits. The competition in originating loans comes principally from other U.S., Puerto Rico and
foreign banks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and
other institutional lenders and purchasers of loans. Certain of the Corporation&#146;s competitors are
not subject to the same extensive regulation that governs the Corporation&#146;s business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation anticipates that it will encounter greater competition with the expansion
of its operations on the U.S. mainland. Many institutions with which the Corporation competes on
the U.S. mainland have significantly greater assets, capital, name recognition, customer loyalty
and other resources. As a result, certain of its competitors may have advantages in conducting
certain businesses and providing certain services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased competition could require that the Corporation increase the rates offered on
deposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability.

concentrated in Puerto Rico. Consequently, the financial condition and results of operations are
highly dependent on economic conditions in Puerto Rico. An extended economic slowdown in Puerto

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of
Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of
stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year
term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore,
control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings
must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. The
Corporation&#146;s certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of
Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds of
the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of
directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of
Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These
provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire the Corporation because
of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result,
may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital
stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for
the Corporation&#146;s capital stock.

Division of the U.S. Department of Justice that the Department of Justice was conducting an
investigation concerning the participation by its subsidiary, GM Group, Inc. (which after a
reorganization in 2004 became part of EVERTEC), in the E-rate program, which is administered by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&nbsp;and pays for telecommunications services and related
equipment for schools and libraries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;13, 2005, the Corporation entered into a Settlement Agreement with the Department
of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission in connection with this matter. Pursuant to
the Settlement Agreement, EVERTEC, without admitting liability and denying any allegations of
misconduct, agreed to make a $4.8&nbsp;million payment to the United States and agreed to voluntarily
disqualify itself from bidding on or performing any work related to contracts funded by the Federal
Communications Commission for a three year period. EVERTEC also agreed to cooperate with U.S.
governmental authorities in any investigation or litigation related to its participation in the
E-rate program. The Settlement Agreement did not have an impact on the Corporation&#146;s third or
fourth quarter results of operations or the Corporation&#146;s financial condition because the full
amount of the settlement payment had been previously accrued and because EVERTEC is not engaged in
work related to Federal Communications Commission contracts.

ordinary course of business. Management believes, based on the opinion of legal counsel, that the
aggregate liabilities, if any, arising from such actions would not have a material adverse effect
on the financial position and results of operations of the Corporation.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Under the direction of the Corporation&#146;s Audit Committee, management conducted a review of the
accounting treatment related to the transactions (&#147;the transactions&#148;) between the Corporation and
its subsidiaries, and Doral and R-G. This review was performed given the announcements by these
companies of their intention to restate their financial statements. As mentioned elsewhere in the
MD&#038;A included in the Annual Report, after conducting the assessment of the Doral and R-G
transactions, the Corporation concluded that its previously filed audited consolidated annual
financial statements are fairly stated and no restatement is necessary.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><U><B>Management&#146;s Report</B></U>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Corporation&#146;s management, with the participation of the Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Corporation&#146;s disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the
Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the
end of such period, the Corporation&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at the
reasonable assurance level, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis,
information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act, solely because of the material weakness described in the management&#146;s
assessment included in Management&#146;s Report to Stockholders filed in our Annual Report, which
relates to the presentation and classification of certain cash flows in the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows as further described below.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">During the preparation of the Annual Report, management became aware that disbursements on mortgage
loans originated or acquired by Popular Financial Holdings, Inc., our U.S. mortgage and consumer
lending subsidiary, with the intent to sell in the secondary market or securitized in transactions
structured as sales, were incorrectly presented as cash flows related with investing activities,
instead of operating activities, which is the presentation required by SFAS No.&nbsp;102 &#147;Statement of
Cash Flows &#151; Exemption of Certain Enterprises and Classification of Cash Flows from Certain
Securities Acquired for Resale.&#148; This reclassification impacted solely the year-to-date
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows included in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarters ended March&nbsp;31, June&nbsp;30, and September&nbsp;30, 2005. In recent speeches, members of the staff
of the SEC have expressed the view that reclassifications within the statement of cash flows should
be treated as a restatement of the information previously presented and not as reclassifications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The correction of the quarterly information contained in this Annual Report does not change total
cash reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Furthermore, the correction has no
effect on the Corporation&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Income (including, but not limited to net
income and earnings per share), Consolidated Statements of Condition or Consolidated Statements of
Changes in Stockholders&#146; Equity. The annual cash flows on the aforementioned disbursements on
mortgage loans have been properly classified as &#147;cash flows used in operating activities&#148; in the
Corporation&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">There have been no changes in the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the
quarter ended on December&nbsp;31, 2005, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Subsequent to the date of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation has
remediated the design of the control associated with the material weakness and will test the
operating effectiveness of such control in 2006.
