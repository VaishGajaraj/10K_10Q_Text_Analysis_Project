</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;31, 2007, E-LOAN, as well as all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries,

operating subsidiaries of BPNA. Prior to the consummation of this corporate reorganization, E-LOAN
was a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of PFH. E-LOAN continues to offer its full range of products
and conduct its direct activities through its online platform.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporate reorganization integrates a significant portion of Popular&#146;s U.S. mainland
lending operations into BPNA with the goal of centralizing similar business lines and facilities.
This integration will benefit BPNA and E-LOAN and the direct and indirect subsidiaries of each by
combining the knowledge and experience of the two entities in the lending business. E-LOAN will
also benefit from lower cost of funding. BPNA expects to strengthen the services it provides to
customers and expand its operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reorganization did not cause any disruption or interruption in the delivery of services

potential customers in each of the markets served.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;9, 2007, Popular, Inc. announced the Restructuring and Integration Plan (the
&#147;Plan&#148;) for PFH, including E-LOAN, Inc. The Plan calls for PFH to exit the wholesale nonprime
mortgage origination business, focus on existing profitable businesses, and consolidate support
functions with its sister U.S. banking entity BPNA, creating a single integrated North American
financial services unit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Plan, the Corporation also announced that effective January&nbsp;9, 2007,
the U.S. mainland operations of Popular North America, Inc. (BPNA, PFH and their subsidiaries
including E-LOAN, Inc.) will report to Roberto R. Herencia, currently president of BPNA. Cameron
E. Williams, who served as President of PFH has retired from the Company effective January&nbsp;9, 2007.
Mr.&nbsp;Williams is assisting Mr.&nbsp;Herencia on transitional matters.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Described below are the material elements of selected laws and
regulations applicable to the Corporation, PIB, PNA and their
respective subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be
complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full
text of the statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable
law or regulation, and in their application by regulatory agencies,
cannot be predicted, but they may have a material effect on the

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>General</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation, PIB and PNA are bank holding companies subject to supervision and regulation
by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. Under the BHC Act, prior to the adoption of the
Gramm Leach Bliley Act in 1999, the activities of bank holding companies and their banking and
non-banking subsidiaries were limited to the business of banking and activities closely related to
banking, and no bank holding company could directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of
more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company in the
United States, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In
addition, bank holding companies generally have been prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in
non-banking activities, unless they were found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related
to banking. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act authorized bank holding companies that qualify as &#147;financial

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDIA&#148;) requires, among other things, the federal
banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not
meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital tiers: &#147;well capitalized&#148;,
&#147;adequately capitalized&#148;, &#147;undercapitalized&#148;, &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;, and &#147;critically
undercapitalized&#148;. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies provide that a depository institution will be
deemed to be (1)&nbsp;well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and is
not subject to any written agreement or directive to meet a specific capital level; (2)&nbsp;adequately
capitalized, if it is not well capitalized, but maintains a leverage ratio of at least 4% (or at
least 3% if given the highest regulatory rating in its most recent
report of examination and not experiencing or anticipating significant
growth), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4% and a total risk-based capital ratio of
at least 8%; (3)&nbsp;undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized
institutions (unless it is deemed significantly or critically undercapitalized); (4)&nbsp;significantly
undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of
less than 3% or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%; and (5)&nbsp;critically
undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to 2% or less of total assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2006, Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. were all well capitalized.
An institution&#146;s capital category, as determined by applying the prompt corrective action
provisions of law, may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition
or prospects of the institution, and the capital condition of the Corporation&#146;s banking
subsidiaries should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the
Corporation&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well
capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The appropriate agency is
also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with
the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a
significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory
information other than the capital levels of the institution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking
agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe
or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution
(including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the
depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository
institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition,
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to
submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the
capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at
the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution
fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without
determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to
succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to
submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly
undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and
restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized,
requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or
conservator.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to FDIC-insured
depository institutions such as Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A., but they are not

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to restrictions under federal law that
limit the transfer of funds by any of them to the Corporation, PIB, PNA, or any of the
Corporation&#146;s other non-banking subsidiaries, whether in the form of loans, other extensions of
credit, investments or asset purchases. Such transfers by Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular,
N.A. to any of the Corporation, PIB, PNA, or any of the
Corporation&#146;s
other non-banking subsidiaries are limited in amount to
10% of the transferring institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus and, with respect to the
Corporation and all of its non-banking subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the transferring
institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus. For these purposes an institution&#146;s capital stock and
surplus includes its total risk-based capital plus (1)&nbsp;the balance of its allowance for loan losses
not included therein and (2)&nbsp;the amount of certain investments made by the institution in
&#147;financial subsidiaries&#148; that is required to be deducted from the institution&#146;s capital for
regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, any such loans and extensions of credit are required to
be secured in specified amounts. In addition, federal law requires that any transaction between
Banco Popular, BPNA or Banco Popular, N.A., on the one hand, and the Corporation, PIB, PNA or any
of the Corporation&#146;s other non-banking subsidiaries, on the other hand, be carried out on an arm&#146;s
length basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company such as the Corporation, PIB or
PNA is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to
commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when,
absent such policy, the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support. In
addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository
institutions are subordinated in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of
such subsidiary depository institution. In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any
commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a
subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
priority of payment. Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are currently the only depository
institution subsidiaries of the Corporation, PIB and PNA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Corporation, PIB and PNA are holding companies, their right to participate in the
assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#146;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the
prior claims of the subsidiary&#146;s creditors (including depositors in the case of subsidiary
depository institutions) except to the extent that the Corporation, PIB or PNA, as the case may be,
may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the FDIA, a depository institution, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, can
be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in
connection with (i)&nbsp;the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or
(ii)&nbsp;any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository
institution &#147;in danger of default&#148;. &#147;Default&#148; is defined generally as the appointment of a
conservator or a receiver, and &#147;in danger of default&#148; is defined generally as the existence of
certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory
assistance. Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are currently FDIC-insured depository
institution subsidiaries of the Corporation and are subject to this cross-guarantee liability. In
some circumstances (depending upon the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the
FDIC), cross-guarantee liability may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more
insured depository institutions in a holding company structure. Any obligation or liability owed by
a subsidiary depository institution to its parent company is subordinated to the subsidiary
depository institution&#146;s cross-guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled FDIC-insured
depository institutions.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal source of cash flow for the Corporation is dividends from Banco Popular. Various
statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends Banco Popular may pay to the Corporation without
regulatory approval. As a member bank subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board,
Banco Popular must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total
of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its
net income (as reportable in its Report of Condition and Income) for that year, combined with its
retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required
transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member
bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported
in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the
Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be
withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. For this purpose,
permanent capital means the total of the bank&#146;s perpetual preferred stock and related surplus,
common stock and surplus and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, as reportable in the
Report of Condition and Income. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, Banco Popular and BPNA could have declared a
dividend of approximately $208&nbsp;million and $246&nbsp;million, respectively, without the approval of the
Federal Reserve Board. However, the Corporation has never received any dividend payments from its
U.S. subsidiaries and it believes that the likelihood of receiving dividend payments from any of
its U.S. subsidiaries in the foreseeable future is remote based on
the growth it is undertaking on
the U.S. mainland.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment of dividends by Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. may also be affected
by other regulatory requirements and policies, such as the maintenance of adequate capital. If, in
the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a depository institution under its jurisdiction
is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (that, depending on the
financial condition of the depository institution, could include the payment of dividends), such
authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such depository institution cease and desist
from such practice. The OCC and FDIC have indicated that the payment
of dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if the
payment would deplete a depository institution&#146;s capital base to
an inadequate level. Under the FDIA, an insured institution may not
pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized
or if it already is undercapitalized. See &#147;&#151;Prompt
Corrective Action&#148; above. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board,
and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that the bank
holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends
only out of current operating earnings.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
October&nbsp;22, 2004, the President signed into law the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which lowers the withholding tax rate
imposed on distributions of U.S. sourced dividends to a corporation
organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico from 30%
to 10%. The Corporation&#146;s U.S. mainland subsidiaries earnings are
considered permanently invested. Accordingly, the new law which
lowered the withholding tax rate to 10% is not expected to have a
material impact on the Corporation in the foreseeable future.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments.
On February&nbsp;8, 2006 the President signed the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the
&#147;Reform Act&#148;). The Reform Act provides for the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund (&#147;BIF&#148;) and Savings
Association Insurance Fund (&#147;SAIF&#148;) into a single Deposit Insurance Fund, an increase the maximum
amount of the insurance coverage for certain retirement accounts, and possible &#147;inflation
adjustments&#148; in the maximum amount of coverage available with respect to other insured accounts. In
addition, it granted a one-time initial assessment credit (of approximately $4.7&nbsp;billion) to
recognize institutions&#146; past contributions to the fund.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
deposits of Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are insured
up to the applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund
(&#147;DIF&#148;) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance
assessments to maintain the DIF. For 2006 the FDIC utilized a risk
based assessment system that imposed insurance premiums based upon a
matrix that took into account a bank&#146;s capital level and
supervisory rating. Premiums under that assessment system ranged from
0 cents for each $100 of domestic deposits for well-capitalized and
well managed banks to 27&nbsp;cents for each $100 of domestic
deposits for the weakest
institutions. Our bank subsidiaries were not required to pay
insurance premiums to the FDIC during 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Reform Act, the FDIC made significant changes to its risk-based
assessment system so that effective Jan.&nbsp;1, 2007 the FDIC
imposes insurance premiums based upon a matrix that is designed to
more closely tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks
they pose. The new FDIC risk-based assessment system imposes premiums
based upon factors that vary depending upon the size of the bank.
These factors are: for banks with less than $10&nbsp;billion in
assets &#151; capital level, supervisory rating, and certain financial
ratios; for banks with $10&nbsp;billion up to $30&nbsp;billion in
assets &#151; capital level, supervisory rating, certain financial ratios
and (if at least one is available) debt issuer ratings, and
additional risk information; and for banks with over $30&nbsp;billion
in assets &#151; capital level, supervisory rating, debt issuer ratings
(unless none are available in which case certain financial ratios are
used), and additional risk information. The FDIC has adopted a new
base schedule of rates that the FDIC can adjust up or down, depending
on the revenue needs of the DIF, and has set initial premiums for
2007 that range from 5&nbsp;cents per $100 of domestic deposits for
the banks in the lowest risk category to 43&nbsp;cents per $100 of
domestic deposits for banks in the highest risk category. The new
assessment system is expected to result in increased annual
assessments on the deposits of our bank subsidiaries of 5 to 7 basis
points per $100 of deposits. Our bank subsidiaries have available an
FDIC credit to offset future assessments. Significant increases in
the insurance assessments of our bank subsidiaries will increase our
costs once the credit is fully utilized.

to include any deposit with an interest rate more than 75 basis points above prevailing rates)
unless it is (i)&nbsp;well capitalized or (ii)&nbsp;adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the
FDIC. A bank that is adequately capitalized may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess
of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates specified by regulation. There are no such
restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized. The Corporation does not believe the brokered
deposits regulation has had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of Banco

consists of common equity, retained earnings, minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for
bank holding companies and member banks. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1
Capital to total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below (the
&#147;leverage ratio&#148;) of 3% for bank holding companies and member banks that have the highest
regulatory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s market risk capital measure. All
other bank holding companies and member banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of
4%. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making
acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum
supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the guidelines
indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider a &#147;tangible Tier 1 leverage
ratio&#148; and other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new
activities. The tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization&#146;s Tier 1

of the OCC. See Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 19 &#147;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#148; on
page 97 and 98 for the capital ratios of the Corporation, Banco Popular and BPNA. Failure to meet

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies&#146; risk-capital guidelines are based upon
the 1988 capital accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (&#147;BSC&#148;). The BSC is
comprised by the central bank of governors and bank supervising authorities of the Group of Ten
countries (G10). The BSC is also responsible for developing broad policy guidelines used by each
country&#146;s supervisor in determining its supervisory guidelines.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;2001, the BSC released a proposal to replace the 1988 capital accord with a new set
of guidelines. The new Basel Capital Accord (Basel II) would set, for the first time, capital
requirements for operational risk, defined as the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events. It also refines
the existing capital requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal regulatory agencies released the latest Notice on Proposed Rulemaking (NPR)&nbsp;on
September&nbsp;2006. The NPR details the current Basel II regulatory mindset on capital requirements,
and establishes January&nbsp;2008 as the first possible period for banks to adopt the proposed rule. A
second NPR, concerning details for Basel IA, was released on December&nbsp;26, 2006. Basel IA,
originally proposed on 2005 by federal regulatory agencies, promotes revisions to the existing
risk-based capital framework that would enhance its risk sensitivity without unduly increasing
regulatory burden. This proposal intends to correct the differences between financial institutions
adopting Basel II and those institutions remaining under the current regulatory capital regime.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basel IA and Basel II are still under revision in response to industry, national, and
regulatory commentary, as the official response period for both proposals is set to March&nbsp;2007.
The Corporation expects that a new capital accord will eventually be adopted by the BSC and
enforced by the federal banking agencies. In the meantime, the Corporation continues to work

Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (&#147;FIN 46&#148;), which addresses the
consolidation rules to be applied to &#147;variable interest entities&#148; as defined in FIN 46. In December
2003 the FASB amended FIN 46 in FASB interpretation No.&nbsp;46 (revised December&nbsp;2003) (&#147;FIN 46R&#148;). FIN
46R, applies to certain variable interest entities by no later than March&nbsp;15, 2004. Under FIN 46R
issuer trusts may constitute variable interest entities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, issuer trusts that issued trust preferred securities have been consolidated by
their parent companies and the accounts of such issuer trusts have been included in the
consolidated financial statements of such parent companies. In addition, trust preferred securities
have been treated as eligible for Tier 1 capital treatment by bank holding companies under Federal
Reserve rules and regulations relating to minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated
subsidiaries. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, $824,000,000 in trust preferred securities that the
Corporation treated as Tier 1 capital under existing Federal Reserve Board guidelines were
outstanding. The Corporation has determined that the issuer trusts for its trust preferred
securities transactions are variable interest entities. The variable interest entities were
deconsolidated commencing with the Corporation&#146;s December&nbsp;31, 2003 financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued
limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies
(BHCs). Under the final rule, trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements
will be subject to stricter quantitative limits.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s final rule limits restricted core capital elements to 25&nbsp;percent
of all core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability.
Internationally active BHCs, defined as those with consolidated assets greater than $250&nbsp;billion or
on-balance-sheet foreign exposure greater than $10&nbsp;billion, will be subject to a 15&nbsp;percent limit.
They may, however, include qualifying mandatory convertible preferred securities up to the
generally applicable 25&nbsp;percent limit. Amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of
these limits generally may be included in Tier 2 capital. The final rule provides a five-year
transition period, ending March&nbsp;31, 2009, for application of the quantitative limits.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 amended the FDIA to
permit a bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire banks located in
states other than the holding company&#146;s home state without regard to whether the transaction is
prohibited under state law. In addition, national and state banks with different home states are
permitted to merge across state lines, with approval of the appropriate federal banking agency.
States are also allowed to permit de novo interstate branching. Once a bank has established
branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish or acquire
additional branches at any location in the state where any bank involved in the interstate merger
transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. A
bank that has established a branch in a state through de novo branching (if permitted under state
laws) may establish and acquire additional branches in such state in the same manner and to the
same extent as a bank having a branch in such state as a result of an interstate merger. If a state
opted out of interstate branching within the specified time period, no bank in any other state may

the state that has opted out, whether through an acquisition or de

Banco Popular is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same
restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks. However,
for purposes of the International Banking Act (the &#147;IBA&#148;),
Banco Popular is considered to be a foreign bank and may branch
interstate by merger or de&nbsp;novo to the same extent as a domestic
bank in Banco Popular&#146;s home state, which is New York for purposes of
the IBA. The Corporation has not yet determined how these statutes

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was enacted on November&nbsp;12, 1999. Among other things, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: (i)&nbsp;allows bank holding companies whose subsidiary depository institutions
meet management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially
broader range of nonbanking activities than was previously permissible, including insurance
underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies; (ii)
allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks; (iii)&nbsp;removes various
restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and
mutual fund advisory companies; and (iv)&nbsp;establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to
bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a bank holding company to engage in the broader range of activities that are
permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (i)&nbsp;all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be
well capitalized (as described above) and well managed and (ii)&nbsp;it must file a declaration with
the Federal Reserve that it elects to be a &#147;financial holding
company.&#148; The Corporation, PIB and PNA have elected to be
treated as financial holding companies. A depository institution is
deemed to be &#147;well managed&#148; if at its most recent inspection, examination or subsequent review by
the appropriate federal banking agency (or the appropriate state banking agency), the depository
institution received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; composite rating and at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148;
rating for management. In addition, to commence any new activity permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and to acquire any company engaged in any new activities permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding
company must have received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating in its most recent examination under
the Community Reinvestment Act. There are no conditions or events since
December&nbsp;31, 2006 that management believes have changed the
Corporation, PIB and PNA financial holding companies status.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also modified other laws, including laws related to financial
privacy and community reinvestment. The new financial privacy provisions generally prohibit
financial institutions, including the Corporation&#146;s bank subsidiaries, from disclosing nonpublic
personal financial information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to &#147;opt out&#148;
of the disclosure.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;26, 2001, the President signed into law comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation
known as the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;). Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act
substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing
significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and
expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
U.S. Treasury Department (the &#147;Treasury&#148;) has issued and,
in some cases proposed, a number of regulations implementing
the USA PATRIOT Act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions, including the
Corporation&#146;s bank subsidiaries. The regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions
to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money
laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of
customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence
requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or
private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or
persons.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act&#146;s requirements could
have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. The Corporation believes that
the cost of compliance with Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act is not likely to be material to the
Corporation.

on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including
prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a
sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#147;U.S.&nbsp;persons&#148;
engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in,

specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an
interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to
U.S.&nbsp;jurisdiction (including property in the possession or
control of U.S.&nbsp;persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and

subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial
Institutions of Puerto Rico (the &#147;Office of the Commissioner&#148;), pursuant to the Puerto Rico
Banking Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Banking Law&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the yearly net
income of Banco Popular be credited annually to a reserve fund. This apportionment must be done
every year until the reserve fund is equal to the total of paid-in capital on common and preferred
stock. During 2006 Banco Popular transferred $30&nbsp;million to the reserve fund in order to comply
with this requirement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater
than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the
undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve
fund. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the
outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared
until capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original
capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve that, except as
otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less than 20% of its demand
liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by
collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a state of the United
States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that
state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the
reserve requirements of Section&nbsp;16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated
November&nbsp;24, 1982, Banco Popular has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal
Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, Banco Popular is
subject to the reserve requirements prescribed by the Banking Law.

undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of
the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided profits.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Financial results are constantly exposed to market risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the market
value of assets and liabilities due to interest rate volatility. Despite the varied nature of
market risks, the primary source of this risk to the Corporation is the impact of changes in
interest rates on net interest income.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated on earning assets and
the interest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics
of the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could either
increase or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structure
of the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature
or reprice in that period. Any mismatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
is known as a gap position. A positive gap denotes asset sensitivity, which means that an increase
in interest rates could have a positive effect on net interest income, while a decrease in interest
rates could have a negative effect on net interest income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Corporation is subject to interest rate risk because of the following factors:

    <TD width="1%">&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at

    <TD>Assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by
different amounts. For example, when the general level of interest rates is
rising, we may increase rates charged on loans by an amount that is less than
the general increase in market interest rates because of intense pricing
competition. Also, basis risk occurs when assets and liabilities have similar
repricing frequencies but are tied to different market interest rate indices.</TD>

    <TD>The remaining maturity of various assets and liabilities

long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, mortgage-backed
securities held in the securities available-for-sale portfolio may
prepay significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduce
portfolio income. If prepayment rates increase, the Corporation
would be required to amortize net premiums into income over a
shorter period of time, thereby reducing the corresponding asset
yield and net interest income. Prepayment risk also has a
significant impact on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized
mortgage obligations, since prepayments could shorten the weighted
average life of these portfolios.</TD>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level, management may alter the mix of
floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities, change pricing schedules, adjust maturities through
sales and purchases of investment securities, and enter into derivative contracts, among other alternatives. The
Corporation may suffer losses or experience lower spreads than anticipated in initial projections
as management implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The hedging transactions that the Corporation enters into may not be effective in managing the
exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation uses derivatives, to a limited extent, to manage part of the exposure to
market risk caused by changes in interest rates or basis risk. The derivative instruments that the
Corporation may utilize also have their own risks, which include: (1)&nbsp;basis risk, which is the risk
of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and/or hedge
cost; (2)&nbsp;credit or default risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the
counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder; and (3)&nbsp;legal risk,
which is the risk that the Corporation is unable to enforce certain terms of such instruments. All
or any of such risks could expose the Corporation to losses.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Reductions in the Corporation&#146;s credit ratings or those of any of its subsidiaries would
increase the cost of borrowing funds and make the Corporation&#146;s ability to raise new funds or renew
maturing debt more difficult.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit ratings are an important component of the Corporation&#146;s liquidity profile. Among
other factors, credit ratings are based on the financial strength, the credit quality of and
concentrations in the Corporations&#146; loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital
adequacy, the quality of management, the liquidity of the Corporation&#146;s balance sheet, the
availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to
access a broad array of wholesale funding sources. Changes in the Corporation&#146;s credit ratings or
the credit ratings of any of its subsidiaries to a level below &#147;investment grade&#148; would adversely
affect the Corporation&#146;s ability to raise funds in the capital markets. The Corporation&#146;s
counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade. In the event of a downgrade,
the cost of borrowing funds would increase. In addition, the Corporation&#146;s ability to raise new
funds in the capital markets or renew maturing debt may be more difficult.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits depends
on various factors, including service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by the
operating results and credit ratings by nationally recognized credit agencies. A downgrade in
credit ratings may impact the ability to raise deposits, but the Corporation believes that the
impact should not be material. Deposits at all of its banking subsidiaries are federally insured
(subject to limitations established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), which is
expected to mitigate the effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>A failure to comply with financial covenants in contractual agreements could accelerate
payments of related borrowings.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of borrowing from institutional lenders and other investors, the
Corporation has entered into contractual agreements to maintain certain levels of debt, capital and
asset quality, among other financial covenants. Failing to comply with those agreements may result
in an event of default, which could accelerate the repayment of the related borrowings. An event of
default would also affect the Corporation&#146;s ability to raise new funds or renew maturing debt.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with
respect to the loans originated or acquired. The Corporation establishes provisions for loan
losses, which lead to reductions in the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance
for future loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an
assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures and
guidelines. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future
loan losses or that the Corporation will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in the
future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons beyond its
control.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>A prolonged economic downturn or recession would likely result in an increase in
delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures and in a reduction of the loan origination activity which
would adversely affect the Corporation&#146;s financial results.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A period of reduced economic growth or a recession has historically resulted in a
reduction in lending activity and an increase in the rate of defaults in commercial loans, consumer
loans and residential mortgages. A recession may have a significant adverse impact on the net
interest income and fee income. The Corporation may also experience significant losses on the loan
portfolio due to a higher level of defaults on commercial loans, consumer loans and residential
mortgages.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The Corporation operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by
changes in federal and local laws and regulations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by
federal and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal or Puerto Rico laws
or regulations could have a substantial impact on its operations. Additional laws and regulations
may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect the Corporation&#146;s powers,
authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation&#146;s financial
condition and results of operations. Further, regulators, in the performance of their supervisory
and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and
unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this
regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on the Corporation.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the Corporation&#146;s
profitability.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation faces substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting
deposits. The competition in originating loans comes principally from other U.S., Puerto Rico and
foreign banks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and
other institutional lenders and purchasers of loans. Certain of the Corporation&#146;s competitors are
not subject to the same extensive regulation that governs the Corporation&#146;s business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation anticipates that it will encounter greater competition with the expansion
of its operations on the U.S. mainland. Many institutions with which the Corporation competes on
the U.S. mainland have significantly greater assets, capital, name recognition, customer loyalty
and other resources. As a result, certain of its competitors may have advantages in conducting
certain businesses and providing certain services.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased competition could require that the Corporation increase the rates offered on
deposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect its profitability.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The Corporation is exposed to greater risk because a significant portion of the business is
concentrated in Puerto Rico, which was experienced an economic slowdown.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant portion of the Corporation&#146;s financial activities and credit exposure are
concentrated in Puerto Rico. Consequently, the financial condition and results of operations are
highly dependent on economic conditions in Puerto Rico. An extended economic slowdown in Puerto
Rico, adverse political or economic developments in Puerto Rico or natural disasters, such as
hurricanes, affecting Puerto Rico could result in a downturn in loan originations, an increase in
the level of nonperforming assets, an increase in the rate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans
and a reduction in the value of the Corporation&#146;s loans and loan servicing portfolio, all of which
would adversely affect the Corporation&#146;s profitability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although official statistics are not yet available, it is probable that the Puerto
Rico economy ended 2006 in recession. It is estimated that the economy started contracting in the
first quarter of 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time since 2002, manufacturing has shown an outright decline in overall activity
up to 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005. The trend worsened somewhat as the semester

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction remained relatively weak during the first three quarters of 2006, as the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">construction projects affected the sector. However, it did manage to expand very
modestly vs. the prior-year period. The value of construction permits during the first three
quarters of 2006 declined 9.4%, with most of the drop coming from the public sector. Retail sales
during the same period also reflected the
uncertainty prevalent at the time related to the Commonwealth&#146;s fiscal situation, as well as
increased oil and utility prices. Sales registered a decline of 1.8% as compared to the same period
in 2005, as the months surrounding a temporary government shutdown, due to budgetary deficits, were
particularly affected. The unemployment rate, after spiking temporarily to almost 20% in May as a
result of the shutdown, has declined to 9.7% as of September&nbsp;2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism is the one sector that has been resilient. Activity in the sector has expanded
consistently since 2004, and in the year ending June&nbsp;2006 it registered the strongest increase in
four years. Factors that may be boosting the tourism sector are geo-political tensions throughout
the world, a relative benign hurricane season for the past two years, and a relatively solid U.S.
economy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general it is apparent that in 2006 the P.R. economy entered a recession, primarily due to
weaker manufacturing, softer consumption and decreased government investment in construction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above economic concerns and uncertainty in the private and public sectors may also have an
adverse effect in the credit quality of the Corporation&#146;s loan portfolios, as delinquency rates may
increase in the short-term, until the economy stabilizes. Also, a potential reduction in consumer
spending may also impact growth in other interest and non-interest revenue sources of the
Corporation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of
Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of
stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year
term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore,
control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings
must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. The
Corporation&#146;s certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of
Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds of
the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of
directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of
Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These
provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire the Corporation because
of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result,
may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital
stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for
the Corporation&#146;s capital stock.

of the Corporation&#146;s loans to the Government and its portfolio of Puerto Rico Government
Securities.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Puerto Rico&#146;s economy is closely integrated to that of the U.S. mainland and its
government and many of its instrumentalities are investment-grade rated borrowers in the U.S.
capital markets, the current fiscal situation of the Government of Puerto Rico has led nationally
recognized rating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2006, Moody&#146;s Investors Service downgraded the Government&#146;s general obligation bond
rating to Baa3 from Baa2, and put the credit on &#147;watch list&#148; for possible further downgrades. The
Commonwealth&#146;s appropriation bonds and some of the subordinated revenue bonds were also downgraded
by one notch and are now rated just below investment grade at Ba1. Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Rating
Services (&#147;S&#038;P&#148;) still rates the Government&#146;s general obligations two notches above junk at BBB,
and the Commonwealth&#146;s appropriation bonds and some of the subordinated revenue bonds BBB-, a
category that continues to be investment-grade rated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2006, S&#038;P and Moody&#146;s affirmed their credit ratings on the Commonwealth debt, and
removed the debt from their respective watch lists, thus reducing the possibility of an immediate
additional downgrade. These actions resulted after the Government approved the budget for the
fiscal year 2007, which runs from July&nbsp;2006 through June&nbsp;2007, which included the adoption of a new
sales tax. Revenues from the sales tax will be dedicated primarily to fund the government&#146;s
operating expenses, and to a lesser extent, to repay government debt and fund local municipal
governments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both rating agencies maintained the negative outlook for the Puerto Rico obligation bonds.
Factors such as the government&#146;s ability to implement meaningful steps to curb operating
expenditures, improve managerial and budgetary controls, and eliminate the government&#146;s reliance on
operating budget loans from the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico will be key determinants
of future rating stability and restoration of a stable long-term outlook. Also, the inability to
agree on future fiscal year Commonwealth budgets could result in ratings pressure from the rating
agencies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgrade
in Puerto Rico&#146;s debt obligations. However, the fallout from recent budgetary crisis and a possible
ratings downgrade could adversely affect the value of Puerto Rico&#146;s Government obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
substantial portion of the Corporation&#146;s credit exposure to the
Government of Puerto Rico is either collateralized loans or
obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues
identified for their repayment. Some of these obligations consist of
senior and subordinated loans to public corporations that obtain
revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as water
and electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying
degrees of independence from the central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from the central Government. The Corporation
also has loans to various municipalities for which the good faith, credit and
unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has been
pledged to their repayment. These municipalities are required by law
to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required
for the payment of all of its general obligation bonds and loans.
Another portion of these loans consist of special obligations of
various municipalities that are payable from the basic real and
personal property taxes collected within such
municipalities. The full good faith and credit obligations of the
municipalities have a first lien on the basic property taxes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Corporation had $901&nbsp;million of credit facilities granted to or
guaranteed by the P.R. Government and its political subdivisions, of which $50&nbsp;million are
uncommitted lines of credit. Of these total credit facilities
granted, $735&nbsp;million in loans were
outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2006. A substantial portion of the credit exposure to the Government of
Puerto Rico has an identified repayment stream, which includes in some cases the good faith, credit
and unlimited taxation power of certain municipalities and, an assignment of basic property taxes
and other revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as of December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Corporation had outstanding $187&nbsp;million in
Obligations of Puerto Rico, States and Political Subdivisions as part of its investment portfolio.
Of that total, $164&nbsp;million is exposed to the creditworthiness of the P.R. Government and its
municipalities. Of that portfolio, $58&nbsp;million are in the form of Puerto Rico Commonwealth&#146;s
Appropriation Bonds, which are

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">currently rated Ba1, one notch below investment grade, by Moody&#146;s

nationally recognized credit rating
agency. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Appropriation Bonds indicated above represented approximately
$3.0&nbsp;million in unrealized losses in the Corporation&#146;s portfolio of investment securities
available- for- sale. The Corporation is closely monitoring the political and economic situation of
the Island and evaluates the portfolio for any declines in value that management may consider being
other- than- temporary. Management has the intent and ability to hold these investments for a
reasonable period of time or up to maturity for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to (or
beyond) the cost of these investments.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>A prolonged economic slowdown or a decline in the real estate market in the U.S mainland could harm
the results of operations of one of the Corporation&#146;s business segments</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying
periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and
industry-wide losses. Any decline in residential mortgage loan originations in the market could
also reduce the level of mortgage loans the Corporation may produce in the future and adversely
impact its business. During periods of rising interest rates, refinancing originations for many
mortgage products tend to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their
existing mortgage loans are reduced. In addition, the residential mortgage loan origination
business is impacted by home values. Over the past several years, residential real estate values in
some areas of the U.S. mainland have increased greatly, which has contributed to the recent rapid
growth in the residential mortgage industry, particularly with respect to refinancings. If
residential real estate values decline, this could lead to lower volumes and higher losses across
the industry, adversely impacting the Corporation&#146;s business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Corporation makes a substantial number of loans to credit-impaired borrowers
through its subsidiary PFH, the actual rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on these
loans could be higher during economic slowdowns. Rising unemployment, higher interest rates or
declines in housing prices tend to have a greater negative effect on the ability of such borrowers
to repay their mortgage loans. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, approximately 71% of PFH&#146;s mortgage loan
portfolio was non-prime, meaning that they have a credit score of 660 or below. This represented
approximately 44% of the Corporation&#146;s mortgage loan portfolio as of such date. Any sustained
period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could harm the Corporation&#146;s ability to
sell loans, the prices it receives for its loans, the values of its mortgage loans held-for-sale or
its residual interests in securitizations, which could harm the Corporation&#146;s financial condition
and results of operations. In addition, any material decline in real estate values would weaken the
Corporation&#146;s collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower
defaults. In such event, the Corporation will be subject to the risk of loss on such mortgage
assets arising from borrower defaults to the extent not covered by third-party credit enhancement.

Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ)&nbsp;National Market System under the symbol
&#147;BPOP&#148;. Information concerning the range of high and low sales prices for the Corporation&#146;s common
shares for each quarterly period during 2006 and the previous four years, as well as cash dividends
declared is contained under Table J, &#147;Common Stock Performance&#148;, on page 34 and under the caption

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of February&nbsp;26, 2007, the Corporation had 10,542 stockholders of record of its Common
Stock, not including beneficial owners whose shares are held in record names of brokers or other

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;23, 2005, the Corporation announced a subscription offering of up to 10,500,000
shares of common stock to holders of record at the close of business on November&nbsp;7, 2005, which was
the record date for the subscription offering. Each holder of record was entitled to a basic
subscription right to purchase one share of common stock for every 26 shares of common stock held
by that holder as of the close of business on the record date at a price of $21.00 per share. The
subscription offering was signed up for the full 10,500,000 shares. This represented approximately
$216&nbsp;million in additional capital, of which approximately $175&nbsp;million impacted stockholders&#146;
equity at December&nbsp;31, 2005 upon the issuance of 8,614,620 shares of common stock and the remainder
impacted the Corporation&#146;s financial condition in the first quarter of 2006 when 1,885,380

control over financial reporting existed at December&nbsp;31, 2005, as reported in the Corporation&#146;s
2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Prior to filing the 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the
Corporation remediated the design of the control associated with the presentation and
classification of certain cash flows. The consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2005 was fairly stated, in all material respects, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. During 2006, management assessed the
operating effectiveness of such control and concluded that the controls put into place were
adequately designed and were operating for a sufficient period of time for management to conclude
that the material weakness had been remediated as of December&nbsp;31, 2006.
