<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of banking is highly competitive. In addition to competition from other
commercial banks, banks face significant competition from nonbank financial institutions. Savings
associations compete aggressively with commercial banks for deposits and loans. Credit unions and
finance companies are significant players in the consumer loan market. Investment firms and
retailers are significant competitors for some types of business. Banks compete for deposits with a
broad spectrum of other types of investments such as mutual funds, stocks and debt securities of
corporations, and debt securities of the federal government, state governments and their respective
agencies. The principal methods of competition for financial services are price (interest rates
paid on deposits, interest rates charged on borrowings and fees charged for services) and service
(convenience and quality of services rendered to customers).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s business is described in more detail on pages 1 through 36 of the Business
Review Section of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, which is
incorporated herein by reference.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>REGULATION AND SUPERVISION</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>General</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation, PIB and PNA are bank holding companies subject to supervision and regulation
by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. Under the BHC Act, prior to the adoption of the
Gramm Leach Bliley Act in 1999, the activities of bank holding companies and their banking and
non-banking subsidiaries were limited to the business of banking and activities closely related to
banking, and no bank holding company could directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of
more than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company in the
United States, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In
addition, bank holding companies generally have been prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in
non-banking activities, unless they were found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related
to banking. Effective April&nbsp;30, 2002, the Corporation elected to be treated as a Financial Holding
Company under the provisions of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and may not engage in a substantially
broader range of non-banking activities. See &#147;Financial Services Modernization&#148; below for
information regarding changes to these rules.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to supervision and examination by
applicable federal and state banking agencies including, in the case of Banco Popular, the Federal
Reserve Board and the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico, in the
case of BPNA, the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking Department and in the case
of Banco Popular, N.A., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#147;OCC&#148;) and the Commissioner
of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico. Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject
to requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain
reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and
the interest that may be charged thereon, and limitations on the other types of investments that
may be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations
also affect the operations of Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. See &#147;Financial Services
Modernization&#148; below for information about changes made to these rules. In addition to the impact
of regulations, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve
Board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the
economy.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Prompt Corrective Action</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDIA&#148;) requires, among other things, the federal
banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not
meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital tiers: &#147;well capitalized&#148;,
&#147;adequately capitalized&#148;, &#147;undercapitalized&#148;, &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;, and &#147;critically
undercapitalized&#148;. The relevant capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio and the leverage ratio.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies provide that a depository institution will be
deemed to be (1)&nbsp;well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and is
not subject to any written agreement or directive to meet a specific capital level; (2)&nbsp;adequately
capitalized, if it is not well capitalized, but maintains a leverage ratio of at least 4% (or at
least 3% if given the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing or anticipating significant
growth), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4% and a total risk-based capital ratio of
at least 8%; (3)&nbsp;undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized
institutions (unless it is deemed significantly or critically undercapitalized); (4)&nbsp;significantly
undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of
less than 3% or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%; and (5)&nbsp;critically
undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to 2% or less of total assets.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2004, Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. were all well capitalized.
An institution&#146;s capital category, as determined by applying the prompt corrective action
provisions of law, may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition
or prospects of the institution, and the capital condition of the Corporation&#146;s banking
subsidiaries should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the
Corporation&#146;s financial condition and results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well
capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The appropriate agency is
also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with
the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a
significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory
information other than the capital levels of the institution.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking
agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe
or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution
(including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the
depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository
institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition,
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to
submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the
capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at
the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution
fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without
determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to
succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to
submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly
undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and
restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized,
requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or
conservator.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to FDIC-insured
depository institutions such as Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A., but they are not

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">applicable to holding companies such as the Corporation, PIB and PNA, which control such
institutions. However, the federal banking agencies have indicated that, in regulating holding
companies, they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment
of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions
pursuant to such provisions and regulations.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Holding Company Structure</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to restrictions under federal law that
limit the transfer of funds by any of them to the Corporation, PIB, PNA, or any of the
Corporation&#146;s other non-banking subsidiaries, whether in the form of loans, other extensions of
credit, investments or asset purchases. Such transfers by Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular,
N.A. to any of the Corporation, PIB, PNA, or any non-banking subsidiaries are limited in amount to
10% of the transferring institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus and, with respect to the
Corporation and all of its non-banking subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the transferring
institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus. For these purposes an institution&#146;s capital stock and
surplus includes its total risk-based capital plus (1)&nbsp;the balance of its allowance for loan losses
not included therein and (2)&nbsp;the amount of certain investments made by the institution in
&#147;financial subsidiaries&#148; that is required to be deducted from the institution&#146;s capital for
regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, any such loans and extensions of credit are required to
be secured in specified amounts. In addition, federal law requires that any transaction between
Banco Popular, BPNA or Banco Popular, N.A., on the one hand, and the Corporation, PIB, PNA or any
of the Corporation&#146;s other non-banking subsidiaries, on the other hand, be carried out on an arm&#146;s
length basis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company such as the Corporation, PIB or
PNA is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to
commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when,
absent such policy, the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support. In
addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository
institutions are subordinated in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of
such subsidiary depository institution. In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any
commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a
subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
priority of payment. Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are currently the only depository
institution subsidiaries of the Corporation, PIB and PNA.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Corporation, PIB and PNA are holding companies, their right to participate in the
assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#146;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the
prior claims of the subsidiary&#146;s creditors (including depositors in the case of subsidiary
depository institutions) except to the extent that the Corporation, PIB or PNA, as the case may be,
may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the FDIA, a depository institution, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, can
be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in
connection with (i)&nbsp;the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or
(ii)&nbsp;any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository
institution &#147;in danger of default&#148;. &#147;Default&#148; is defined generally as the appointment of a
conservator or a receiver, and &#147;in danger of default&#148; is defined generally as the existence of
certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory
assistance. Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are currently FDIC-insured depository
institution subsidiaries of the Corporation and are subject to this cross-guarantee liability. In
some circumstances (depending upon the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the
FDIC), cross-guarantee liability may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more
insured depository institutions in a holding company structure. Any obligation or liability owed by
a subsidiary depository institution to its parent company is subordinated to the subsidiary
depository institution&#146;s cross-guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled FDIC-insured
depository institutions.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Dividend Restrictions</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal source of cash flow for the Corporation is dividends from Banco Popular. Various
statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends Banco Popular may pay to the Corporation without
regulatory approval. As a member bank subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board,
Banco Popular must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total
of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its
net income (as reportable in its Report of Condition and Income), for that year, combined with its
retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required
transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member
bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported
in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the
Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be
withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. For this purpose,
permanent capital means the total of the bank&#146;s perpetual preferred stock and related surplus,
common stock and surplus and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, as reportable in the
Report of Condition and Income. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, Banco Popular could have declared a dividend
of approximately $222&nbsp;million without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment of dividends by Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. may also be affected
by other regulatory requirements and policies, such as the maintenance of adequate capital. If, in
the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a depository institution under its jurisdiction
is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (that, depending on the
financial condition of the depository institution, could include the payment of dividends), such
authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such depository institution cease and desist
from such practice. In addition, all FDIC-insured depository institutions are subject to the
capital-based limitations required by the FDIA. See &#147;-Prompt Corrective Action&#148; above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See &#147;&#150;Puerto Rico Regulation-General&#148; below for a description of certain restrictions on Banco
Popular&#146;s ability to pay dividends under Puerto Rico law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>FDIC Insurance Assessments</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments.
Pursuant to the FDIA, the FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system, under which the
assessment rate for an insured depository institution varies according to the level of risk
incurred in its activities. An institution&#146;s risk category is based partly upon whether the
institution is well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized. Each
FDIC-insured depository institution is also assigned to one of the following &#147;supervisory
subgroups&#148;: &#147;A&#148;, &#147;B&#148; or &#147;C&#148;. Group &#147;A&#148; institutions are financially sound institutions with only a
few minor weaknesses; Group &#147;B&#148; institutions are institutions that demonstrate weaknesses that, if
not corrected, could result in significant deterioration; and Group &#147;C&#148; institutions are
institutions for which there is a substantial probability that the FDIC will suffer a loss in
connection with the institution unless effective action is taken to correct the areas of weakness.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, premiums related to deposits assessed by both the BIF and the Savings Association
Insurance Fund (&#147;SAIF&#148;) are to be assessed at an annual rate of between 0 cents and 27 cents per
$100.00 of deposits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of favorable loss experience and a healthy reserve ratio in the BIF, well capitalized
and well managed banks, including the Corporation&#146;s bank subsidiaries, have in recent years paid no
premiums for FDIC insurance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 also separated the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;)
assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the BIF and SAIF assessments. The
amount assessed on individual institutions by the FICO is in addition to the amount, if any, paid
for deposit insurance according to the FDIC&#146;s risk-related assessment rate schedules. The current
FICO annual

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">assessment rate is 1.44 cents per $100 of deposits. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Corporation
had a BIF deposit assessment base of approximately $19.9&nbsp;billion.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, even well capitalized and well managed banks may be required to pay premiums on
deposit insurance. It is not possible to determine when any such premiums will become assessable or
the level of such premiums.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Brokered Deposits</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FDIC regulations adopted under FDIA govern the receipt of brokered deposits. Under these
regulations, a bank cannot accept, roll over or renew brokered deposits (which term is defined also
to include any deposit with an interest rate more than 75 basis points above prevailing rates)
unless (i)&nbsp;it is well capitalized or (ii)&nbsp;it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from
the FDIC. A bank that is adequately capitalized may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in
excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates specified by regulation. There are
no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized. The Corporation does not believe the
brokered deposits regulation has had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of
Banco Popular, BPNA or Banco Popular, N.A.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Capital Adequacy</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information about the capital composition of the Corporation as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 and for
the four previous years is presented in Table H &#147;Capital Adequacy Data&#148; on page 21 in the
&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; (MD&#038;A).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and
member banks, the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital (&#147;Total Capital&#148;) to risk-weighted
assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At
least half of the Total Capital is to be comprised of common equity, retained earnings, minority
interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual
preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock less goodwill and
certain other intangible assets (&#147;Tier 1 Capital&#148;). The remainder may consist of a limited amount
of subordinated debt, other preferred stock, certain other instruments and a limited amount of loan
and lease loss reserves (&#147;Tier 2 Capital&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for
bank holding companies and member banks. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1
Capital to total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below (the
&#147;leverage ratio&#148;) of 3% for bank holding companies and member banks that have the highest
regulatory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s market risk capital measure. All
other bank holding companies and member banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of
4%. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making
acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum
supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the guidelines
indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will continue to consider a &#147;tangible Tier 1 leverage
ratio&#148; and other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new
activities. The tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization&#146;s Tier 1
Capital less all intangibles, to total assets less all intangibles.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to the risk-based and leverage capital requirements adopted
by the Federal Reserve Board. Banco Popular, N.A. is subject to substantially similar requirements
of the OCC. See Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 19 &#147;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#148; on
page 75 and 76 for the capital ratios of the Corporation, Banco Popular and BPNA. Failure to meet
capital guidelines could subject the Corporation and its depository institution subsidiaries to a
variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and to
certain restrictions on its business. See &#147;-Prompt Corrective Action&#148;.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies&#146; risk-capital guidelines are based upon the 1988
capital accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#147;BSC&#148;). The BSC is a committee
comprised by central bank governors and bank supervisor authorities of the Group of Ten countries
(G10). The BSC is in charge of developing broad policy guidelines used by each country&#146;s supervisor
to determine its own supervisory guidelines. In January&nbsp;2001 the BSC released a proposal to replace
the 1988 capital accord with a new set of guidelines. The new Basel Accord would set for the first
time capital requirements for operational risk and refine the existing capital requirements for
credit risk and market risk exposures. The 1988 capital accord does not include a separate capital
requirement for operational risk, which is defined under the proposed accord as the risk of direct
or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from
external events. The BSC has stated that its objective is to finalize a new accord by the middle of
this year. The accord is expected to be adopted by each member country and implemented by opt-in
banks at year end 2006.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Basel Accord is still under revision in response to industry, national and regulatory
commentaries. Factors such as the capital charge for addressing operational risk are still
undergoing changes. The Corporation is closely monitoring the implementation process of the new
accord and planning to comply with its requirements. The Corporation expects that a new capital
accord will eventually be adopted by the BSC and enforced by the federal banking agencies. At this
time the Corporation cannot determine with certainty whether the capital requirements that may
arise out of a new Basel Accord will increase or decrease minimum capital requirements applicable
to the Corporation and its subsidiaries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#147;FASB&#148;) issued FASB
Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (&#147;FIN 46&#148;), which addresses the
consolidation rules to be applied to &#147;variable interest entities&#148; as defined in FIN 46. In December
2003 the FASB amended FIN 46 in FASB interpretation No.&nbsp;46 (revised December&nbsp;2003) (&#147;FIN 46R&#148;). FIN
46R, applies to certain variable interest entities by no later than March&nbsp;15, 2004. Under FIN 46R
issuer trusts may constitute variable interest entities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, issuer trusts that issued trust preferred securities have been consolidated by
their parent companies and the accounts of such issuer trusts have been included in the
consolidated financial statements of such parent companies. In addition, trust preferred securities
have been treated as eligible for Tier 1 capital treatment by bank holding companies under Federal
Reserve rules and regulations relating to minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated
subsidiaries. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, $824,000,000 in trust preferred securities that the
Corporation treated as Tier 1 capital under existing Federal Reserve Board guidelines were
outstanding. The Corporation has determined that the issuer trusts for its trust preferred
securities transactions are variable interest entities. The variable interest entities were
deconsolidated commencing with the Corporation&#146;s December&nbsp;31, 2003 financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the continued
limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies
(BHCs). Under the final rule, trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements
will be subject to stricter quantitative limits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s final rule limits restricted core capital elements to 25&nbsp;percent
of all core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability.
Internationally active BHCs, defined as those with consolidated assets greater than $250&nbsp;billion or
on-balance-sheet foreign exposure greater than $10&nbsp;billion, will be subject to a 15&nbsp;percent limit,
but they may include qualifying mandatory convertible preferred securities up to the generally
applicable 25&nbsp;percent limit. Amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of these limits
generally may be included in Tier 2 capital. The final rule provides a five-year transition period,
ending March&nbsp;31, 2009, for application of the quantitative limits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Interstate Banking Legislation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 amended the FDIA to
permit a bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire banks located in
states other than the holding company&#146;s home state without regard to whether the transaction is
prohibited under

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">state law. In addition, national and state banks with different home states are permitted to
merge across state lines, with approval of the appropriate federal banking agency. States are also
allowed to permit de novo interstate branching. Once a bank has established branches in a state
through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish or acquire additional branches at
any location in the state where any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have
established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. A bank that has established
a branch in a state through de novo branching (if permitted under state laws) may establish and
acquire additional branches in such state in the same manner and to the same extent as a bank
having a branch in such state as a result of an interstate merger. If a state opted out of
interstate branching within the specified time period, no bank in any other state may establish a
branch in the state that has opted out, whether through an acquisition or de novo. A foreign bank,
like Banco Popular, may establish branches interstate, by merger or de novo, to the same extent as
a domestic bank in the foreign bank&#146;s home state, which, in the case of Banco Popular, is New York.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Financial Services Modernization</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was enacted on November&nbsp;12, 1999. Among other things, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: (i)&nbsp;allows bank holding companies whose subsidiary depository institutions
meet management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially
broader range of nonbanking activities than was previously permissible, including insurance
underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies; (ii)
allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks; (iii)&nbsp;removes various
restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and
mutual fund advisory companies; and (iv)&nbsp;establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to
bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations. This part of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act became effective on March&nbsp;11, 2000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a bank holding company to engage in the broader range of activities that are
permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (i)&nbsp;all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be
well capitalized (as described above) and well managed and (ii)&nbsp;it must file a declaration with
the Federal Reserve that it elects to be a &#147;financial holding company.&#148; A depository institution is
deemed to be &#147;well managed&#148; if at its most recent inspection, examination or subsequent review by
the appropriate federal banking agency (or the appropriate state banking agency), the depository
institution received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; composite rating and at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148;
rating for management. In addition, to commence any new activity permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and to acquire any company engaged in any new activities permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding
company must have received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating in its most recent examination under
the Community Reinvestment Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election by the Corporation, PIB and PNA to become financial holding companies became
effective April&nbsp;30, 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also modified other laws, including laws related to financial
privacy and community reinvestment. The new financial privacy provisions generally prohibit
financial institutions, including the Corporation&#146;s bank subsidiaries, from disclosing nonpublic
personal financial information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to &#147;opt out&#148;
of the disclosure.

known as the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA Patriot Act&#148;). Title III of the USA Patriot Act
substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to help serve the credit needs of their
communities, including credit to low and moderate income individuals and geographies. Should the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various other legislation, including proposals to limit the investments that a depository
institution may make with insured funds, is from time to time introduced in Congress. The
Corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that such potential legislation, if enacted, or
implementing regulations would have upon its financial condition or results of operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;22, 2004, President George W. Bush signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004, which lowers the withholding tax rate imposed on distributions of U.S. sourced dividends
to a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico from 30% to 10%. The
Corporation&#146;s foreign subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently invested. Accordingly, the
new law which lowered the withholding tax rate to 10% is not expected to have an impact in the
Corporation&#146;s earnings in the foreseeable future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Puerto Rico Regulation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>General. </I></B>As a commercial bank organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, Banco Popular is
subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Office of the Commissioner of Financial
Institutions of Puerto Rico (the &#147;Office of the Commissioner&#148;), pursuant to the Puerto Rico
Banking Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Banking Law&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the yearly net
income of Banco Popular be credited annually to a reserve fund. This apportionment must be done
every year until the reserve fund is equal to the total of paid-in capital on common and preferred
stock. At the end of 2004 Banco Popular&#146;s reserve fund exceeded the total of paid-in capital on
common and preferred stock. As a result, Banco Popular requested authority from the Puerto Rico
Commissioner of Financial Institutions to transfer $53&nbsp;million from the reserve fund to retained
earnings. This request was approved by the Puerto Rico Commissioner of Financial Institutions and
the transfer was made in December&nbsp;2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater
than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the
undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve
fund. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the
outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared
until capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to 20% of the original
capital.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve that, except as
otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less than 20% of its demand
liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by
collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a state of the United
States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that
state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the
reserve requirements of Section&nbsp;16. Pursuant

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated November&nbsp;24, 1982, Banco Popular has been
exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve System with respect to deposits
payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, Banco Popular is subject to the reserve requirements
prescribed by the Banking Law.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to any one person, firm,
partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of fifteen percent (15%) of the paid-in
capital and reserve fund of the bank. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the legal lending limit for the Bank
under this provision was approximately $84&nbsp;million. The above limitations do not apply to loans
which are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan up to a maximum
aggregate amount of one third of the paid-in capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the
institution is well capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the
Office of the Commissioner or any regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15%
of 50% of its undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than
the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided
profits. Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional
component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the
Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section&nbsp;17 on the amount of loans that are wholly
secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United
States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or
instrumentalities of Puerto Rico.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;14 of the Banking Law authorizes a bank to conduct certain financial and related
activities directly or through subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal property,
originating and servicing mortgage loans and operating a small loan company. Banco Popular engages
in these activities through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Popular Auto, Inc., Popular Mortgage,
Inc. and Popular Finance, Inc., respectively, all of which are organized and operate in Puerto
Rico.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Board, which includes as its members the Commissioner of Financial Institutions,
the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Consumer Affairs, the
President of the Planning Board, and the President of the Government Development Bank for Puerto
Rico, has the authority to regulate the maximum interest rates and finance charges that may be
charged on loans to individuals and unincorporated businesses in Puerto Rico. The current
regulations of the Finance Board provide that the applicable interest rate on loans to individuals
and unincorporated businesses (including real estate development loans but excluding certain other
personal and commercial loans secured by mortgages on real estate properties and finance charges on
retail installment sales and for credit card purchases) is to be determined by free competition.

may not amend its articles of incorporation or issue additional shares of capital stock or other
securities convertible into additional shares of capital stock unless such shares are issued
directly to the shareholders of PIB previously identified in the application to organize the
international banking entity, in which case notification to the Office of the Commissioner must be
given within ten business days following the date of the issue. Pursuant to the IBC Act, without
the prior approval of the Office of the Commissioner, PIB may not initiate the sale, encumbrance,
assignment, merger or other transfer of shares if by such transaction a person or persons acting in
concert could acquire direct or indirect control of 10% or more of any class of PIB&#146;s stock. Such
authorization must be requested at least 30&nbsp;days prior to the transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PIB must submit to the Office of the Commissioner a report of its condition and results of
operation on a quarterly basis and its annual audited financial statements at the close of its
fiscal year. Under the IBC Act, PIB may not deal with &#147;domestic persons&#148; as such term is defined
in the IBC Act. Also, it may only engage in those activities authorized in the IBC Act, the
regulations adopted thereunder and its license.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IBC Act empowers the Office of the Commissioner to revoke or suspend, after a hearing, the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Commissioner finds that the business of the IBE is conducted in a manner not consistent with the
public interest.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2004, the Government of Puerto Rico approved a legislation that partially
eliminates the tax exempt status of IBE that operates as a division or branch of a bank in Puerto
Rico. In order to be subject to tax, the IBE&#146;s net taxable income must exceed 40% in 2004, 30% in
2005, and 20% in 2006 and thereafter, of the net taxable income of the bank as a whole. Once these
thresholds are exceeded, the IBE will be taxed at regular tax rates on its net taxable income that
exceeds the applicable threshold. Currently, management of the Corporation does not expect any
financial impact from this new legislation since the net taxable income of BPPR&#146;s IBE has not
exceeded and is not expected to exceed 20% of BPPR&#146;s net taxable income.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Employees</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Corporation employed directly 12,142 persons. None of its employees
are represented by a collective bargaining group.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note 30 to the Financial Statements, &#147;Segment Reporting&#148; on pages 89 through 92 is herein
incorporated by reference.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2004, the Corporation reorganized its corporate structure into five principal areas
(referred to by management as &#147;circles&#148;): one for the corporate group and one for each of the
Corporation&#146;s four principal businesses &#150; Popular Puerto Rico, United States Financial Services,
Popular Financial Holdings and Processing. Each such circle has been identified as a reportable segment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management determined the reportable
segments, based on the internal reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess where to
allocate resources. The segments were determined based on the new organizational structure which
focuses primarily towards products and services and on the markets the segments serve. Other
factors, such as the credit risk characteristics of the loan products, distribution channels and
clientele, were also considered in the determination of reportable segments.

30 also provides additional information, by business line, for the
Popular Puerto Rico circle, the Corporation&#146;s principal market.

under the equity method in the Dominican Republic and El Salvador and other long-lived assets

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;18, 2005, the Corporation announced that it had been informed by the Antitrust
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice that the Department of Justice is conducting an
investigation concerning participation by its subsidiary, GM Group, Inc. (which after a
reorganization in 2004 is part of EVERTEC, Inc.), in the E-rate program, which is administered by
the Federal Communications Commission and pays for telecommunications services and related
equipment for schools and libraries. GM Group learned of the investigation in June&nbsp;2003. The
Corporation does not know the full scope of the Department of Justice investigation and cannot
predict at this time the impact of the investigation on the Corporation or its subsidiaries, or
when or on what basis the investigation will be resolved. The Corporation is cooperating fully with
the investigation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation and its subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits arising in the
ordinary course of business. Management believes, based on the opinion of legal counsel, that the
aggregate liabilities, if any, arising from such actions would not have a material adverse effect
on the financial position and results of operations of the Corporation.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">last sales price for the Corporation&#146;s Common Stock on such date, as quoted on the NASDAQ was
$26.49 per share.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May&nbsp;12, 2004, the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a stock split in the form of
a stock dividend of one additional share of common stock for each common stock share held as of the
record date of June&nbsp;18, 2004. The new shares were distributed on July&nbsp;8, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective April&nbsp;30, 2004, the Corporation&#146;s Restated Certificate of Incorporation was amended
to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 180,000,000 to 470,000,000 and the
number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock from 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 shares.

A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Corporation&#146;s outstanding Series&nbsp;A Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock, with respect to dividend rights and rights on liquidation. The terms of the Series
A Preferred Stock do not permit the Corporation to declare or pay any dividends on the Common Stock
(1)&nbsp;unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock for the 12 dividend periods
preceding the dividend payment have been paid and the full dividend on the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock
for the current monthly dividend period is contemporaneously declared and paid or set aside for
payment or (2)&nbsp;if the Corporation has defaulted in the payment of the redemption price of any
shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock called for redemption.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional information concerning legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends
by the Corporation and Banco Popular is contained under the caption &#147;Regulation and Supervision&#148; in
Item&nbsp;1 herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 1994, as amended, generally imposes a withholding tax
on the amount of any dividends paid by corporations to individuals, whether residents of Puerto
Rico or not, trusts, estates and foreign corporations or partnerships not engaged in trade or
business within Puerto Rico at a preferential 10% withholding tax rate. If the recipient is a
foreign corporation or partnership engaged in trade or business within Puerto Rico or a domestic
corporation the dividend will be taxed at regular rates but will be allowed an 85% dividend
received deduction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the first dividend distribution for the taxable year, individuals who are residents
of Puerto Rico may elect to be taxed on the dividends at the regular rates, in which case the
preferential 10% tax will not be withheld from such year&#146;s distributions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A United States citizen who is a non-resident of Puerto Rico will not be subject to Puerto
Rico tax on dividends if said individual&#146;s gross income from sources within Puerto Rico during the
taxable year does not exceed $1,300 if single, or $3,000 if married, and form AS 2732 of the Puerto
Rico Treasury Department, &#147;Withholding Tax Exemption Certificate for the Purpose of Section&nbsp;1147&#148;,
is filed with the withholding agent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. income tax law permits a credit against U.S. income tax liability, subject to certain
limitations, for certain foreign income taxes paid or deemed paid with respect to such dividends.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information under the caption &#147;Executive Compensation Program&#148; of the Corporation&#146;s

Statement&#148;) is incorporated herein by reference.

taxes, plus fixed charges. Fixed charges represent all interest expense (ratios are presented both
excluding and including interest on deposits), the portion of net rental expense, which is deemed
representative of the interest factor and the amortization of debt issuance expense. The interest
expense for the years 2004 thru 2001 include changes in the fair value of the non-hedging
derivatives.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Controls and Procedures</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, an evaluation was performed under the
supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation&#146;s
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that disclosure
controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 were effective in ensuring material information
required to be disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported on a timely basis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, there were no changes in the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management&#146;s responsibilities related to establishing and maintaining effective disclosure
controls and procedures include maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting
that are designed to produce reliable financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. As disclosed in the Management&#146;s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting on page 46 of the Annual Report, management assessed the
Corporation&#146;s system of internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, in
relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in
&#147;Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework,&#148; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December&nbsp;31,
2004, its system of internal control over financial reporting met those criteria and is effective.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been no significant changes in the Corporation&#146;s internal controls or in other
factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2004.
