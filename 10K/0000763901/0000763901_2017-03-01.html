the assets of the company and the personal guarantee of the business owners. CRE loans consist of loans for income-producing real estate properties and real estate developers and the financing of owner-occupied facilities if there is real estate as
collateral. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability that exceeds debt service requirements. Non owner-occupied CRE loans are generally

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interest from our loan portfolios is our principal source of revenue. Whenever we make loans, we expose ourselves to credit risk. At December
31, 2016, our credit exposure was centered in our $ 22.8&nbsp;billion non-covered loan portfolio which represented 66% of our earning assets excluding covered loans. Credit risk is controlled and monitored through active asset quality management,
including the use of lending standards, thorough review of potential borrowers and active asset quality administration. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Business
activities that expose us to credit risk are managed within the Board of Director&#146;s Risk Management policy, and the Credit Risk Tolerance Limits policy which establishes limits that consider factors such as maintaining a prudent balance of
risk-taking across diversified risk types and business units, compliance with regulatory guidance, controlling the exposure to lower credit quality assets, and limiting growth in, and overall exposure to, any product or risk segment where we do not
have sufficient experience and a proven ability to predict credit losses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Credit Strategy Committee (&#147;CRESCO&#148;) is
management&#146;s top policy-making body with respect to credit-related matters and credit strategies. CRESCO reviews the activities of each subsidiary to ensure a proactive and coordinated management of credit granting, credit exposures and credit
procedures. CRESCO&#146;s principal functions include reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and periodically approving appropriate provisions, monitoring compliance with charge-off policy, establishing portfolio diversification,
yield and quality standards, establishing credit exposure reporting standards, monitoring asset quality, and approving credit policies and amendments thereto for the subsidiaries and/or business lines, including special lending approval authorities
when and if appropriate. The analysis of the allowance adequacy is presented to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors for review, consideration and ratification on a quarterly basis. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have a Corporate Credit Risk Management Division (&#147;CCRMD&#148;). The CCRMD is a centralized unit, independent of the lending
function. The CCRMD&#146;s functions include identifying, measuring and controlling credit risk independently from the business units, evaluating the credit risk rating system and reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in accordance
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) and regulatory standards. The CCRMD also ensures that the subsidiaries comply with the credit policies and applicable regulations, and monitors credit underwriting standards. Also, the
CCRMD performs ongoing monitoring of the portfolio, including potential areas of concern for specific borrowers and/or geographic regions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Effective in April 2015, the Corporate Loan Review Unit was separated from the CCRMD, and incorporated into a new division named Corporate
Loan Review and Model Risk Monitoring (&#147;CLR&nbsp;&amp; MRM&#148;). Through the Commercial Loan Review Unit at the Corporate Loan Review Department (&#147;CLRD&#148;), CLR&nbsp;&amp; MRM evaluates compliance with the Bank&#146;s Commercial
Credit Norms and Procedures and the precision of risk rating accuracy. The CLRD performs annual credit process reviews of several commercial portfolios, including small and middle market, construction, asset-based and corporate banking lending
groups in BPPR, as well as BPNA&#146;s commercial and construction portfolios.&nbsp;This group evaluates the credit risk profile of each originating unit along with each unit&#146;s credit administration effectiveness, including the assessment of
the risk rating representative of the current credit quality of the loans, and the evaluation of credit and collateral documentation. The monitoring performed by CLRD contributes to assess compliance with credit policies and underwriting standards,
to determine the current level of credit risk, to evaluate the effectiveness of the credit management process and to identify control deficiencies that may arise in the credit-origination and management processes. Based on its findings, CLRD
develops recommendations to implement corrective actions, if necessary, that help in maintaining a sound credit process and that credit risk is kept at an acceptable level. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We maintain comprehensive credit policies for all lines of business in order to mitigate credit
risk. Our credit policies are ratified by our Board of Directors and set forth, among other things, underwriting standards and procedures for monitoring and evaluating loan portfolio quality. Our credit policies also require prompt identification
and quantification of asset quality deterioration or potential loss in order to ensure the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Included in these policies, primarily determined by the amount, type of loan and risk characteristics of the credit
facility, are various approval levels and lending limit constraints, ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our credit policies and procedures establish strict documentation requirements for each loan and related collateral type, when applicable,
during the underwriting, closing and monitoring phases. During the initial loan underwriting process, the credit policies require, at a minimum, historical financial statements or tax returns of the borrower and any guarantor, an analysis of
financial information contained in a credit approval package, a risk rating determination in the case of commercial and construction loans, reports from credit agencies and appraisals for real estate-related loans. The credit policies also set forth
the required closing documentation depending on the loan and the collateral type. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we originate most of our loans internally in
both the Puerto Rico and mainland United States markets, we occasionally purchase or participate in loans originated by other financial institutions. When we purchase or participate in loans originated by others, we conduct the same underwriting
analysis of the borrowers and apply the same criteria as we do for loans originated by us. This also includes a review of the applicable legal documentation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Set forth below are the general parameters under which we analyze our major loan categories: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Commercial and Construction</U>: Commercial and construction loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrower&#146;s
operations, including the borrower&#146;s business model, management, financial statements, pro-forma financial condition including financial projections, use of funds, debt service capacity, leverage and the financial strength of any guarantor.
Most of our commercial and construction loans are secured by real estate and other collateral. A review of the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party appraisals of machinery and equipment and commercial real estate, as
appropriate, is also conducted. Physical inspection of the collateral and audits of receivables is conducted when appropriate. Our credit policies provide maximum loan-to-value ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the
value of the real estate collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value percentage varies by the type of collateral. Our loan-to value limitations are, in certain cases, determined by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the
borrower or guarantor, the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself. Most CRE loans are originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners. Non-recourse lending is limited to borrowers with
very solid financial capacity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, $ 4.6&nbsp;billion, or 63%, of our commercial and construction loans in
Puerto Rico were secured by real estate, while in the mainland United States these figures totaled $ 3.4&nbsp;billion, or 78%, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Consumer, Mortgage and Lease Financings:</U> Our consumer, mortgage and lease financings are originated consistent with the underwriting
approach described above, but also include an assessment of each borrower&#146;s personal financial condition, including verification of income, assets and Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit score. Credit reports are obtained and reconciled with
the financial statements provided to us. Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans does not exist, for risk assessment purposes, subprime consumer and mortgage loans in the BPPR segment are determined based on the final rule
definition of higher risk consumer loans issued by the FDIC which was made effective during 2013. A higher-risk consumer loan is defined as a loan where, as of origination, or as of refinance, the probability of default (PD) within two years is
greater than 20%. In Puerto Rico, as of December&nbsp;31, 2016, consumer and mortgage loans with subprime characteristics consisted of $152.9&nbsp;million (5% of the Puerto Rico consumer loan portfolio) and $691.7&nbsp;million (12% of the Puerto
Rico mortgage loan portfolio), respectively. Since the final rule definition is not applicable to our U.S. operation, subprime loans in the BPNA segment are defined as borrowers with one or a combination of certain credit risk factors, such as FICO
credit scores (generally less than 620 for secured products and 660 for unsecured products), high debt to income ratios (higher than 50%) and inferior payment history, including factors such as defaults and limited credit history. As of December 31,
2016, our mainland United States consumer and mortgage loans with subprime characteristics consisted of $96.3&nbsp;million (or 20% of the U.S. mainland consumer loan portfolio) and $271.6&nbsp;million (or 35% of U.S. mainland mortgage loans
portfolio). As part of the restructuring in 2008 of our U.S. mainland operations, we discontinued originating loans with subprime characteristics in those operations, including the U.S. non-conventional mortgage loan portfolio and E-LOAN. Popular
does not target subprime borrowers and does not offer products specifically designed for subprime borrowers. </P>

5.88% fixed-rate for the remaining term. Consistent with our credit policies, the underwriting and loan approval process for our step loan mortgage product is based on a number of factors, including an assessment of each borrower&#146;s personal
financial condition (including verification of income, assets and FICO credit score), as well as debt-to-equity ratio, reserves, loan-to-value and prior mortgage experience. While Popular has not established specific limits for FICO credit scores,
debt-to-income ratios and loan-to-values applicable to this product, the underwriting parameters applied to this product are generally similar to the standards used for the underwriting of our non-conforming loans, except for higher loan-to-value
ratios (90% or higher). As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, Popular had $350.5&nbsp;million of these step loans. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December 31, 2016,
$5.9&nbsp;billion, or 65%, of our total consumer loans, including mortgage loans, in Puerto Rico were secured by real estate. In the United States mainland, these figures totaled $ 1.0&nbsp;billion, or 81%, respectively. Lease financings are also
secured by the underlying asset. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Loan extensions, renewals and restructurings</I> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Loans with satisfactory credit profiles can be extended, renewed or restructured. Many commercial loan facilities are structured as lines of
credit, which are mainly one year in term and therefore are required to be renewed annually. Other facilities may be restructured or extended from time to time based upon changes in the borrower&#146;s business needs, use of funds, timing of
completion of projects and other factors. If the borrower is not deemed to have financial difficulties, extensions, renewals and restructurings are done in the normal course of business and are not considered concessions, and the loans continue to
be recorded as performing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We evaluate various factors in order to determine if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties.
Indicators that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties include, for example: (i)&nbsp;the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt or it is probable that the borrower would be in payment default on any of its debt in the
foreseeable future without the modification; (ii)&nbsp;the borrower has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy; (iii)&nbsp;there is significant doubt as to whether the borrower will continue to be a going concern; (iv)&nbsp;currently,
the borrower has securities that have been delisted, are in the process of being delisted, or are under threat of being delisted from an exchange; and (v)&nbsp;based on estimates and projections that only encompass the current business capabilities,
the borrower forecasts that its entity-specific cash flows will be insufficient to service the debt (both interest and principal) in accordance with the contractual terms of the existing agreement through maturity; and absent the current
modification, the borrower cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at an effective interest rate equal to the current market interest rate for similar debt for a non-troubled debtor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have specialized workout officers who handle substantially all commercial loans that are past due 90 days and over, borrowers experiencing
financial difficulties, and those that are considered problem loans based on their risk profile. As a general policy, we do not advance additional money to borrowers that are 90 days past due or over. In commercial and construction loans, certain
exceptions may be approved under certain circumstances, including (i)&nbsp;when past due status is administrative in nature, such as expiration of a loan facility before the new documentation is executed, and not as a result of payment or credit
issues; (ii)&nbsp;to improve our collateral position or otherwise maximize recovery or mitigate potential future losses; and (iii)&nbsp;with respect to certain entities that, although related through common ownership, are not cross defaulted nor
cross-collateralized and are performing satisfactorily under their respective loan facilities. Such advances are underwritten following our credit policy guidelines and approved up to prescribed policy limits, which are dependent on the
borrower&#146;s financial condition, collateral and guarantee, among others. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the legal lending limit established under applicable state banking law, discussed
in detail below, business activities that expose the Corporation to credit risk should be managed within guidelines described in the Credit Risk Tolerance Limits policy. Limits are defined for loss and credit performance metrics, portfolio
composition and concentration, and industry and name-level, which monitors lending concentration to a single borrower or a group of related borrowers, including specific lending limits based on industry or other criteria, such as a percentage of the
banks&#146; capital. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Loans to borrowers with financial difficulties can be modified as a loss mitigation alternative. New terms and
conditions of these loans are individually evaluated to determine a feasible loan restructuring. In many consumer and mortgage loans, a trial period is established where the borrower has to comply with three consecutive monthly payments under the
new terms before implementing the new structure. Loans that are restructured, renewed or extended due to financial difficulties and the terms reflect concessions that would not otherwise be granted are considered as Troubled Debt Restructurings
(&#147;TDRs&#148;). These concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. These concessions stem from an agreement
between the creditor and the debtor or are imposed by law or a court. TDRs also include loans for which the Corporation has entered into liquidation proceedings with borrowers in which neither principal or interest is forgiven, but the Corporation
accepts payments which are different than the contractual payment schedule. Refer to additional information on TDRs on Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Loans classified as TDRs are reported in non-accrual status if the loan was in non-accruing status at the time of the modification. The TDR
loan will continue in non-accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated a willingness and ability to make the restructured loan payments (at least six months of sustained performance after classified as TDR and management has concluded whether
it is probable that the borrower would not be in payment default in a foreseeable future). If the loan was appropriately on accrual status prior to the restructuring, the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms (for a period
of at least six months, as defined), and the bank&#146;s credit evaluation shows the borrower&#146;s capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms (both principal and interest payments), it is likely that the appropriate conclusion is
for the loan to remain on accrual at the time of the restructuring. Loans classified as TDRs are excluded from TDR status if performance under the restructured terms exists for a reasonable period (at least twelve months of sustained performance
after being classified) and the loan yields a market rate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Business Concentration </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since our business activities are currently concentrated primarily in Puerto Rico, our results of operations and financial condition are
dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. The concentration of our operations in Puerto Rico exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a
wider geographic base. Our asset and revenue composition by geographical area is presented in &#147;Financial Information about Geographic Areas&#148; below and in Note 42, &#147;Segment Reporting&#148;, to the consolidated financial statements
included in the Annual Report. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our loan portfolio is diversified by loan category. However, approximately 66% of our non-covered loan
portfolio at December 31, 2016 consisted of real estate-related loans, including residential mortgage loans, construction loans and commercial loans secured by commercial real estate. The table below presents the distribution of our non-covered loan
portfolio by loan category at December 31, 2016. &#147;Legacy&#148; refers to loans remaining from lines of businesses we exited as a result of the restructuring of our U.S. operations in 2008 and 2009. </P>

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Except for the Corporation&#146;s exposure to the Puerto Rico Government sector, no individual or single group of related
accounts is considered material in relation to our total assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business. At December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Corporation&#146;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and
municipalities amounted to $ 584&nbsp;million, of which approximately $ 529&nbsp;million was outstanding. Of the amount outstanding, $ 459&nbsp;million consists of loans and $ 70&nbsp;million were securities. Obligations from the Government of
Puerto Rico or its public corporations, each of which has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA, amounted to $ 17&nbsp;million of securities at December&nbsp;31, 2016. Obligations from various municipalities in Puerto Rico for which, in
most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment, amounted to $ 53&nbsp;million of securities and $ 459&nbsp;million in loans at December&nbsp;31, 2016. These
municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all of its general obligation bonds and loans. These loans have seniority to the payment of operating cost and expenses of the
municipality. The automatic stay on litigation imposed by PROMESA applies to all municipal obligations to which we are a party.&nbsp;Furthermore, although the PROMESA Oversight Board has not designated any of the Commonwealth&#146;s 78
municipalities as covered entities under PROMESA, it may decide to do so in the future. If the Government of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities are unable to manage their fiscal crisis and refinance their debt in an orderly manner, there could be
further downgrades of the ratings of these obligations and the value of these obligations could be adversely affected, resulting in losses to us. Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements details the loan and investments representing the
Corporation&#146;s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities according to their maturities. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, at December&nbsp;31, 2016, the Corporation had $406&nbsp;million in indirect exposure to loans or securities that are payable by <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-governmental</FONT> entities, but which carry a government guarantee to cover any shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. These included $326&nbsp;million in residential mortgage loans that are
guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. Also, the Corporation had
$49&nbsp;million in Puerto Rico housing bonds pass-through backed by FNMA, GNMA or second mortgages residential loans, and $31&nbsp;million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities, but payable from rent paid by third parties.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Government of Puerto Rico is experiencing a severe fiscal crisis, which has adversely impacted the loans and securities described
above and can result in further losses. For further discussion of our loan portfolio and geographical concentration, including the Government of Puerto Rico&#146;s fiscal crisis, see &#147;Financial Condition &#151; Loans&#148; and &#147;Credit

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
competitors for BPPR include locally based commercial banks and a few large U.S. and foreign banks with operations in Puerto Rico of up to approximately $10&nbsp;billion in assets as of
December&nbsp;31, 2016. On April 30, 2010, the FDIC closed three commercial banks and entered into loss-share purchase and assumption agreements with three other commercial banks with operations in Puerto Rico, including us with respect to
Westernbank Puerto Rico. Those transactions involved the acquisition of most of the assets and liabilities of the closed banks, including the assumption of all of the non-brokered deposits. On December&nbsp;18, 2012, there was another banking
consolidation in Puerto Rico when Oriental Financial Group, a locally based financial institution, acquired the Puerto Rico operations of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A. (BBVA), a foreign bank. On February&nbsp;27, 2015, the Puerto Rico banking
industry further consolidated as a result of another FDIC-assisted transaction in which BPPR, in an alliance with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-bidders,</FONT> including BPNA, acquired certain assets and all deposits, except for certain <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-brokered</FONT> deposits, under receivership of Doral Bank. While these transactions have reduced the number of banking competitors in Puerto Rico, they have allowed some of our competitors to gain greater resources,
such as a broader range of products and services. As of December 31, 2016, there were 8 commercial banks operating in Puerto Rico. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
also compete with specialized players in the local financial industry that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those competitors include brokerage firms, mortgage companies, insurance
companies, automobile and equipment finance companies, local and federal credit unions (locally known as &#147;cooperativas&#148;), credit card companies, consumer finance companies, institutional lenders and other financial and non-financial
institutions and entities. Credit unions generally provide basic consumer financial services. These competitors collectively represent a significant portion of the market and have lower cost structure and fewer regulatory constraints. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United States we continue to face substantial competitive pressure as our footprint resides in two large, metropolitan markets of New
York City / Northern New Jersey and the greater Miami area.&nbsp;There is a large number of Community and Regional banks along with national banking institutions present in both markets, many of which have a larger amount of resources than us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In both Puerto Rico and the United States, the primary factors in competing for business include pricing, convenience of branch locations and
other delivery methods, range of products offered, and the level of service delivered. We must compete effectively along all these parameters to be successful. We may experience pricing pressure as some of our competitors seek to increase market
share by reducing prices. Competition is particularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is very aggressive. Increased competition could require that we increase the rates offered on deposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which
could adversely affect our profitability. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Economic factors, along with legislative and technological changes, will have an ongoing impact
on the competitive environment within the financial services industry. We work to anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions whether it may be developing and marketing innovative products and services, adopting or developing new
technologies that differentiate our products and services, cross-marketing, or providing personalized banking services. We strive to distinguish ourselves from other community banks and financial services providers in our marketplace by providing a
high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to attract and retain business. However, we can provide no assurance as to the effectiveness of these efforts on our future business or results of operations, as to our continued ability to
anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, and to sufficiently improve our services and/or banking products, in order to successfully compete in our primary service areas. </P>

BPPR and BPNA are subject to supervision and examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies including, in the case of BPPR, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (the
&#147;Office of the Commissioner&#148;), and in the case of BPNA, the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Department of Financial Services. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The recent financial crisis led to the adoption and revision of numerous laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions operating
in the U.S. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, and the rules that followed have significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the U.S. As described in more detail below, implementation of the
Dodd-Frank Act and related rulemaking activities continued in 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In October 2012, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal
Reserve Board published final rules regarding <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">company-run</FONT> stress testing. The rules require institutions, such as Popular and BPPR, with average total consolidated assets greater than $10&nbsp;billion to
conduct an annual <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">company-run</FONT> stress test of capital, consolidated earnings and losses under one base and at least two stress scenarios provided by the federal bank regulators. Implementation of the rules for
covered institutions with total consolidated assets between $10&nbsp;billion and $50&nbsp;billion began in 2013. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">company-run</FONT> stress tests are conducted using data as of December 31st of the preceding
calendar year and scenarios released by the agencies. Stress test results must be reported to the agencies by July 31st with public disclosure of summary stress test results under the severely adverse scenario between October 15th and October 31st.
Our capital ratios reflected in the stress test calculations are an important factor considered by the Federal Reserve Board in evaluating the capital adequacy of Popular and its subsidiaries and whether the appropriateness of any proposed payments
of dividends or stock repurchases may be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February 2014, the Federal Reserve Board issued final
rules that were required to be established under Section&nbsp;165 of the Dodd-Frank Act (&#147;Final SIFI Rules&#148;) strengthening supervision and regulation of large U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations. The Final SIFI
Rules established a number of enhanced prudential standards for large U.S. bank holding companies to help increase the resiliency of their operations. These standards include liquidity, risk management, and capital. For U.S. bank holding companies
with total consolidated assets of $50&nbsp;billion or more, the Final SIFI Rules incorporate previously issued capital planning and stress testing requirements as an enhanced prudential standard. The Final SIFI Rules also require U.S. bank holding
companies with total consolidated assets of $50&nbsp;billion or more to comply with enhanced risk-management and liquidity risk-management standards, conduct liquidity stress tests, and hold a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected
funding needs during a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT> stress event. In addition, the Final SIFI Rules require publicly traded U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10&nbsp;billion or more to establish
enterprise-wide risk committees. Popular has a Risk Management committee and is in compliance with this requirement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of
December&nbsp;31, 2016, Popular had total consolidated assets of $38.7&nbsp;billion. As of the same date, BPPR and BPNA had total consolidated assets of $29.7&nbsp;billion and $8.6&nbsp;billion, respectively. </P>

Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDIA&#148;) requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA
establishes five capital tiers: &#147;well capitalized&#148;, &#147;adequately capitalized&#148;, &#147;undercapitalized&#148;, &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;, and &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148;. A depository institution&#146;s
capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures, which reflect changes under the Basel III Capital Rules that
became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2015, are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio (a new ratio requirement under the Basel III Capital Rules), the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An insured depository institution will be deemed to be (i) &#147;well capitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital
ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority
to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not &#147;well capitalized&#148;; (iii) &#147;undercapitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital
ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1
capital ratio less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; </P>

lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. An insured depository institution&#146;s capital category
is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the institution&#146;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDIC generally prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or
paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be &#147;undercapitalized&#148;. &#147;Undercapitalized&#148; depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve
System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the capital restoration plan, up to
an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not
accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit
an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Significantly undercapitalized&#148; depository
institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from
correspondent banks. &#147;Critically undercapitalized&#148; depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to the FDIC-insured depository institutions such as BPPR and BPNA, but

collateralization requirements on such credit extensions. A bank may not engage in any covered transaction if the aggregate amount of the bank&#146;s covered transactions with that affiliate would exceed 10% of the bank&#146;s capital stock and
surplus or the aggregate amount of the bank&#146;s covered transactions with all affiliates would exceed 20% of the bank&#146;s capital stock and surplus. In addition, Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that any transaction between BPPR
or BPNA, on the one hand, and Popular, PNA or any of our other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-banking</FONT> subsidiaries, on the other, be carried out on an arm&#146;s length basis. </P>

Reserve Board&#146;s policy has historically required bank holding companies, such as Popular and PNA to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. The
Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, Popular and PNA are expected to commit resources to support their subsidiary banks, including at times when Popular and PNA may not be in a financial position to
provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository institutions are subordinated in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository institution. In
the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
priority of payment. BPPR and BPNA are currently the only insured depository institution subsidiaries of Popular and PNA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>&#147;Living Will&#148;

dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income (as reportable in its Report of Condition and Income) for that year, combined with its retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the
preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its
Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the
Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to these requirements, BPNA may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board or the New York State Department of Financial Services (the &#147;NYSDFS&#148;). BPNA paid a
dividend of $200&nbsp;million in December 2015 after receiving the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016, BPPR declared cash dividends of $78.8&nbsp;million, a portion of which was
used by Popular for the payments of the cash dividends on its outstanding common stock. Subject to the Federal Reserve&#146;s ability to establish more stringent specific requirements under its supervisory or enforcement authority, at
December&nbsp;31, 2016, BPPR could have declared a dividend of approximately $495&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">It is Federal Reserve Board policy that
bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#146;s
current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Moreover, under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company should not maintain dividend levels that place undue pressure on the capital of depository
institution subsidiaries or that may undermine the bank holding company&#146;s ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that in evaluating the capital plans submitted by bank holding
companies with total consolidated assets of $50&nbsp;billion or more, requests that imply common dividend payout ratios above 30% of projected <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">after-tax</FONT> net income will receive particularly close scrutiny. For

1.35% and December&nbsp;31, 2018. In August 2016, the FDIC announced that the DIF reserve ratio had surpassed 1.15% as of June&nbsp;30, 2016. As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the range of initial assessment ranges of all
institutions were adjusted downward such that the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate ranges from 3 to 30 basis points on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range

terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;) strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Title III of the
USA PATRIOT Act imposed significant compliance and due diligence obligations, created new crimes and penalties and expanded the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT
Act&#146;s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Community Reinvestment Act </I></P>

1075(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added a new Section&nbsp;920 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which gives the Federal Reserve Board the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for electronic debit
transactions, and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the costs of fraud prevention. On June&nbsp;29, 2011, the Federal
Reserve Board issued a final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. The final rule regarding debit card interchange fees became effective on
October&nbsp;1, 2011. Under the final rule, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction.
Also on June&nbsp;29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board approved an interim final rule that allows for an upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer&#146;s debit card interchange fee if the issuer develops and implements policies and
procedures reasonably designed to achieve the fraud-prevention standards set out in the interim final rule. The interim final rule regarding fraud-prevention adjustment also became effective on October&nbsp;1, 2011. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cyber security. One statement indicates that financial institutions
should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate
customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution&#146;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid
recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution&#146;s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business
operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various
regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and
information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ a defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cyber security controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective
tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Some of these defensive measures are provided by EVERTEC as part of their services to us. Notwithstanding the
strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber attacks is severe, attacks are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Risks and exposures related to cyber
security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based

organizations, such as Popular, that are not &#147;large, complex banking organizations.&#148; These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#146;s activities and the prevalence of incentive
compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#146;s ability
to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the
organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness
of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key
principles that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i)&nbsp;provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii)&nbsp;be
compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii)&nbsp;be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#146;s board of directors. </P>

incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1&nbsp;billion in total assets (including Popular, PNA, BPPR and BPNA). The proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to
all covered entities, which would include (i)&nbsp;prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (ii)&nbsp;prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could
lead to a material financial loss; (iii)&nbsp;establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (iv)&nbsp;requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements; and (v)&nbsp;mandating appropriate
record-keeping. Under the proposed rule, larger financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $50&nbsp;billion would also be subject to additional requirements applicable to such institutions&#146; &#147;senior executive

Regulation </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a commercial bank organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, BPPR is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by
the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Banking Law&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the yearly net income of BPPR be credited annually to a reserve
fund. The apportionment must be done every year until the reserve fund is equal to the total of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital on common and preferred stock. During 2016, $ 18.4&nbsp;million was transferred to the statutory
reserve account. During 2016, BPPR was in compliance with the statutory reserve requirement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law also
provides that when the expenditures of a bank are greater than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged against the reserve fund.
If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared until capital has been restored to its original amount and the
reserve fund to 20% of the original capital. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve that,
except as otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less than 20% of its demand liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish
one or more bank branches in a state of the United States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the
reserve requirements of Section&nbsp;16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated November&nbsp;24, 1982, BPPR has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto
Rico. Accordingly, BPPR is subject to the reserve requirements prescribed by the Banking Law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;17 of the Banking Law permits
a bank to make loans to any one person, firm, partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of fifteen percent (15%) of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital and reserve fund of the bank. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016,
the legal lending limit for BPPR under this provision was approximately $272&nbsp;million. In the case of loans which are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the maximum aggregate amount is increased to one
third of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the institution is well capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the Office of the Commissioner or any
regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15% of 50% of its undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of
its undivided profits. Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner. There are no restrictions
under Section&nbsp;17 on the amount of loans that are wholly secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or
instrumentalities of Puerto Rico. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;14 of the Banking Law authorizes a bank to conduct certain financial and related

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>A significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, where a prolonged economic recession and a current fiscal crisis has adversely
impacted and may continue to adversely impact us. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is
concentrated in Puerto Rico, which is experiencing a severe economic and fiscal crisis resulting from continuing economic contraction, persistent and significant budget deficits, a high debt burden, unfunded legacy pension obligations and lack of
access to the capital markets, among other factors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Puerto Rico entered recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross
national product (GNP) thereafter contracted in real terms every year between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2015 (inclusive), except for growth of 0.5% in fiscal year 2012 (likely as a result of the large amount of governmental stimulus and
deficit spending in that fiscal year). GNP is projected to further contract for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Commonwealth&#146;s structural imbalance between revenue and expenditures and unfunded legacy pension obligations, coupled with the
deterioration of the liquidity situation at the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth&#146;s inability to access the capital markets, have recently resulted in the government becoming unable to pay scheduled debt payments
while continuing to provide government services. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In order to confront its liquidity constraints and budget shortfalls, the Government has
been forced to implement certain extraordinary measures, which include delaying the payment of third-party payables and income tax refunds. In addition, pursuant to a local moratorium law, the Commonwealth has suspended the payment of debt service
on its debts and that of several of its public corporations, and has retained certain revenues assigned to particular public corporations, redirecting the same for the funding of operational expenses. The Government has stated that certain of these
emergency liquidity measures are unsustainable and have significant negative economic effects. Also, the Commonwealth has indicated that absent additional liquidity or other emergency measures, it may experience significant bank cash shortfalls as
soon as May&nbsp;1, 2017, triggered by the expiration of the local law moratorium and the stay of litigation imposed pursuant to PROMESA (discussed below). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In response to this crisis, in June 2016, the U.S. Federal Government enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act
(&#147;PROMESA&#148;), which, among other things, established a seven-member Federally-appointed oversight board (the &#147;Oversight Board&#148;) with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and, in order to
provide relief from creditor lawsuits, enacts a temporary stay on litigation to enforce rights or remedies related to outstanding liabilities of the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities and municipalities. PROMESA also provides to the Commonwealth,
its public corporations and municipalities, broad-based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy-type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PROMESA requires the Commonwealth to submit a fiscal plan to the Oversight Board that, among other things, ensures the funding of essential
services, eliminates structural deficits and provides for a debt burden that is sustainable while respecting the relative lawful priorities or lawful liens under local law. The Commonwealth submitted a fiscal plan for consideration of the Oversight
Board in October 2016 that projected that, under current policies, consolidated expenditures (including required pension payments and debt service on <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">tax-supported</FONT> debt) would, in the aggregate, exceed
consolidated resources by approximately $58.7&nbsp;billion from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2026 (later revised based on feedback from the Oversight Board to approximately $67.5&nbsp;billion over the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ten-year</FONT> projection period). The plan estimated that, even assuming the Commonwealth took the measures identified in the plan, in the absence of federal Affordable Care Act funding for the Government&#146;s
health programs, there would still be a material cumulative financing gap during the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">ten-year</FONT> period before the payment of any debt service. The Oversight Board rejected the prior Administration&#146;s plan in
November 2016 and granted the new Administration of Governor Ricardo Rossell&oacute; Nevares an extension to deliver a new fiscal plan until February&nbsp;28, 2017. The Oversight Board, however, has identified a series of initiatives for inclusion
in the certified fiscal plan that include the elimination of budgetary subsidies to municipalities and significant reductions in payroll expenditures and pension and/or pension-related benefits. On February 28, 2017, the Rosell&#243; administration
submitted to their Oversight Board its draft fiscal plan which, among other initiatives, calls for significant reductions in operational expenses and subsides for municipalities and the University of Puerto Rico. The plan, which relies on
significant change in economic assumptions vis a vis the baseline, projects a surplus before debt service of $11.6 billion in the aggregate during the ten year projection period (against $35.1 billion in contractual debt service). </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The credit quality of BPPR&#146;s loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the
general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The effects of the prolonged recession are reflected in limited loan demand, an increase in the rate of foreclosures and
delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. The measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the near future, including higher taxes and lower governmental expenditures, will likely affect many of our
individual customers and customers&#146; businesses, which could cause credit losses that adversely affect us. The size of the financing gap indicated by the Commonwealth&#146;s fiscal projections suggest that the level of fiscal adjustment of any
fiscal plan approved by the Oversight Board, and its resulting impact on the local economy, will be significant, particularly considering the Oversight Board&#146;s stated target of the government&#146;s fiscal year 2019 to achieve budgetary
balance. Such fiscal adjustment may also result in significant resistance from local politicians and other stakeholders, which may lead to social and political instability. The aforementioned conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence,
which would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these conditions and cause decreased borrowings, either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for customer loans. Any reduction in consumer spending because of these
issues may also adversely impact our interest and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-interest</FONT> revenues. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If global or local
economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico is unable to manage its fiscal crisis, including consummating an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, those adverse effects could
continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict and that are outside of our control. While PROMESA provides the Commonwealth with tools to restructure the debt obligations of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities in an orderly
manner, these tools are new and untested. Furthermore, the size of the fiscal gaps suggested by the Commonwealth&#146;s projections indicates the possibility of significant creditor losses. Both of these factors may make any debt restructuring
process highly adversarial and protracted. Under such circumstances, we could experience an increase in the level of provision for loan losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses. Furthermore, the continued
contraction of Puerto Rico&#146;s economy may negatively affect our ability to generate loans in Puerto Rico with an adequate credit risk profile and at a commensurate pricing. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and

in increased credit losses. As of December&nbsp;31, 2016, approximately 3%, 32% and 29% of our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-covered</FONT> loan portfolio consisted of construction loans, commercial loans secured by real estate and mortgage

is in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each
specific real estate market. Recent economic reports related to the real estate market in Puerto Rico indicate that several sectors of the real estate market are subject to reductions in value related to general economic conditions. In particular,
the value of real estate collateral located in Puerto Rico may be further affected by actions taken by the Commonwealth or the PROMESA Oversight Board to address Puerto Rico&#146;s fiscal and economic crisis. Not only are such actions likely to have
negative economic effects in the short run, but also certain measures recommended by the Oversight Board for inclusion in the fiscal plan, and incorporated into the Rosell&#243; Administration fiscal plan proposed, such as reforming the local
property tax regime, could have a direct impact on the value of local real estate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We measure loan impairment based on the fair value of
the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, which is derived from estimated collateral values, principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration prices in observed transactions involving similar assets in similar
locations, size and supply and demand. An appraisal report is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the
property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, given the current slowdown in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if
foreclosed. </P>

estate properties, entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic
downturns. As of December 31, 2016, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-covered</FONT> commercial and construction loans secured by commercial and residential development real estate properties, amounted to $ 8.0&nbsp;billion or 35% of the total <FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial industry and our results of operations and financial condition. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the financial crisis that commenced in 2008, market instability and lack of investor confidence led many lenders and institutional
investors to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. This led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread
reduction of business activity in general. The resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial markets adversely affected our industry and our business, results of operations and financial condition. The increased
regulation of our industry, including as a result of the EESA and the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has increased and may in the future further increase our compliance costs and limit our ability to
pursue business opportunities. The lingering effects of these circumstances have continued to affect our business. A <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-occurrence</FONT> of these difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing
us and others in the financial industry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.
</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Popular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal, New York and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any
change in applicable federal, New York or Puerto Rico laws or regulations could have a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect Popular&#146;s
powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on Popular&#146;s financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant
discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on Popular. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2008, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis, government regulatory agencies and political bodies began
placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. Government intervened on an unprecedented scale. Several funding and capital programs by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury were launched in 2008 and
2009, with the objective of enhancing the ability of financial institutions to raise liquidity. These programs had the effect of increasing the degree or nature of regulatory supervision to which we are subjected. These and other potential
regulation and scrutiny may, or proposed legislative and regulatory changes could, significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and, limit our ability to
pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations or earnings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore,
the Commonwealth has enacted various reforms in response to its fiscal problems and is likely to implement additional reforms as part of its fiscal plan under PROMESA. In 2014, the Government of Puerto Rico approved an amendment to the Internal
Revenue Code, which, among other things, changed the income tax rate for capital gains from 15% to 20%. As a result, Popular recognized additional income tax expense of approximately $20.0&nbsp;million during 2014. In addition, in May 2015, the
Government approved an increase in the sales and use tax rate, effective July&nbsp;1, 2015, from 7% to 11.5% and expanded the sales and use tax to certain
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">business-to-business</FONT></FONT> services that were previously exempt. The Rossell&oacute; Administration has further announced its intention to enact comprehensive tax reform
during 2017. The PROMESA Oversight Board has also recommended a reform of the island&#146;s property tax system. Legislative changes, particularly changes in tax laws, could adversely impact our results of operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, which significantly changes the regulation of financial institutions and the
financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that will affect how community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies will
be regulated in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes new capital requirements on bank holding companies; changes
the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank&#146;s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base, permanently raises the standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expands the
FDIC&#146;s authority to raise insurance premiums. The legislation also calls for the FDIC to raise the ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September 30, 2020 and to &#147;offset the effect&#148; of
increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10&nbsp;billion. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions, establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as an
independent entity within the Federal Reserve, which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards,
and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower&#146;s ability to repay and prepayment penalties. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions that affect corporate governance and
executive compensation at all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts. The legislation also restricts proprietary trading, places restrictions on the owning or sponsoring of hedge
funds and private equity funds, and regulates the derivatives activities of banks and their affiliates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These provisions, or any other
aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities or change certain of our business practices, including the
ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest
significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While the change in
administration in the U.S. may ultimately roll back or modify certain of the regulations adopted or proposed by federal and state regulatory agencies, uncertainty about the timing and scope of any such changes, as well as the cost of complying with
a new regulatory regime, may negatively impact our businesses, at least in the short term, even if the long-term impact of any such changes are positive for our businesses. </P>

of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including
forecasts of economic and market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay the loans. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to
increase the provision for loan losses in the future as a result of future increases in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-performing</FONT> loans or for other reasons beyond our control. Any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any
loan losses in excess of our provisions for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and result of operations. We will continue to evaluate our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and may be
required to increase such amounts. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its public corporations and municipalities that amounted to approximately $
584&nbsp;million, of which approximately $ 529&nbsp;million is outstanding, at December&nbsp;31, 2016. Deterioration of the Commonwealth&#146;s fiscal and economic situation, including any negative ratings implications, could further adversely
affect the value of our Puerto Rico government obligations, resulting in losses to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Of the amount outstanding at December&nbsp;31,
2015, $ 459&nbsp;million consists of loans and $ 70&nbsp;million consisted of securities, $17&nbsp;million represents obligations from the Commonwealth or its public corporations, each of which has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA.
Obligations from various municipalities in Puerto Rico constitute, however, the bulk of our direct exposure to Puerto Rico government obligations. These obligations, which amounted to approximately $512&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2016, are in
most cases &#147;general obligations,&#148; to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or &#147;special obligations,&#148; to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. The
automatic stay on litigation imposed by PROMESA applies to all municipal obligations to which we are a party (other than to municipal obligations issued after the enactment of PROMESA). Furthermore, although the PROMESA Oversight Board has not
designated any of the Commonwealth&#146;s 78 municipalities as covered entities under PROMESA, it may decide to do so in the future. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the fiscal plan submitted by the Commonwealth to the Oversight Board on February 28, 2017 did not contemplate a restructuring of the
debt of Puerto Rico&#146;s municipalities, the plan did call for the gradual elimination of budgetary subsidies provided to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of certain municipalities. The Oversight Board
had previously expressly called for the elimination of these budgetary subsidies as part of any certified fiscal plan. Furthermore, municipalities are also likely to be affected by the negative economic and other effects resulting from expense,
revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Commonwealth&#146;s fiscal and liquidity shortfalls. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have indirect
exposure to loans or securities that are payable by <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-governmental</FONT> entities, but which carry the guarantee of a Puerto Rico governmental entity to cover any shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower
default, which amounted to approximately $406&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2016. These included approximately $326&nbsp;million in residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (&#147;HFA&#148;), an entity
that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying properties and the HFA guarantee serves to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. Also, Popular had
approximately $49&nbsp;million in Puerto Rico housing bonds pass-through backed by FNMA, GNMA or second mortgages residential loans, and approximately $31&nbsp;million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities, but payable from
rent paid by third parties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to
many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other
institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at
prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. We request collateral for most credit exposures with
other financial institutions and monitor these on a regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by us and result in losses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when market confidence is affected by events related to

is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. We have furthermore retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At
December&nbsp;31, 2016, we serviced $1.7&nbsp;billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the
credit recourse provided, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the
event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2016, we repurchased approximately $ 44&nbsp;million in mortgage
loans subject to the credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2016, our liability established to cover the estimated credit
loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $ 54&nbsp;million. We may suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the

and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resulting from representations and warranty violations on
specific portfolios. At December&nbsp;31, 2016, Popular&#146;s reserve for estimated losses from representation and warranty arrangements amounted to $12&nbsp;million, which was included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated statement of

amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances,
indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in Popular&#146;s stock price related to macroeconomic conditions in the global market as well as the weakness in the

carrying value at July&nbsp;31, 2016 by $166&nbsp;million, resulting in no goodwill impairment. If the fair value of BPNA, which is principally impacted by its expected level of profitability, declines further in the future without a corresponding
decrease in the fair value of its net assets, or if loan discounts improve without a corresponding increase in fair value of the BPNA reporting unit, Popular may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge with respect to the BPNA reporting
unit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, as part of the analyses, management performed a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values determined for the

could increase the risk of goodwill impairment in the future. The FASB issued ASU 2017-04 in January 2017, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the two-step goodwill impairment test under the current

risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation agreements of banking organizations that are not &#147;large, complex banking organizations&#148;. These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the
organization&#146;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative are included in reports of examination. Deficiencies are incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory
ratings, which can affect the organization&#146;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or
governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. In May 2016, the Federal Reserve Board, other federal banking agencies

inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1&nbsp;billion or more of assets, such as Popular, PNA, BPPR and BPNA. Although the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-proposed</FONT>
rules include more stringent requirements, it cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted. Compliance with such a final rule may substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives

continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of Popular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate key employees. Limitations on our

These obligations and needs include capitalizing subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and BPNA, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other
distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. In addition, based on its current financial condition, BPNA may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. A failure by our
banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial position. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources
to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Actions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to pay

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Corporation&#146;s banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the
major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. At December&nbsp;31, 2016, the banking subsidiaries had $14&nbsp;million in deposits that were subject to rating triggers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect our relationships with some creditors and business
counterparties. For example, a portion of our hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based on our below
investment grade ratings. The fair value of derivative instruments in a liability position subject to financial covenants approximated $0.8&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2016, with Popular providing collateral totaling $4&nbsp;million to cover
the net liability position with counterparties on these derivative instruments. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute
counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, servicing, licensing and custodial agreements that we are party to with third parties include ratings covenants. Servicing rights
represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings, the third parties could have the right to require Popular to engage a substitute fund
custodian and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure such recourse
obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $62&nbsp;million at December 31, 2016. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements.
Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce Popular&#146;s liquidity resources and
impact its operating results. The termination of those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings
downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below investment grade. </P>

affected. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries must
meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum
capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain well-capitalized status under the regulatory framework, or are deemed not well managed under
regulatory exam procedures, or if we experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company and our related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and our ability to offer certain
financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed
above, under the Dodd-Frank Act, all financial companies with more than $10&nbsp;billion in total consolidated assets, such as Popular, that are supervised by a primary federal financial regulatory agency, are required to perform an annual stress
test. This stress test supports the regulator&#146;s analysis of the adequacy of a banking organization&#146;s capital and is required as part of Popular&#146;s capital management and review. The stress test is performed utilizing a variety of
hypothetical stressed economic scenarios dictated by the Federal Reserve Board. If we are deemed to have inadequate capital under the hypothetical scenarios, then our regulator could prohibit us from taking certain capital actions, such as paying
dividends or repurchasing common stock, or require us to increase our regulatory capital, including through the issuance of common stock that would dilute the ownership of existing shareholders. </P>

substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries. The Basel III Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as
modified certain asset risk weights and other matters affecting the numerator and denominator in a banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios thus implementing a new more complex methodology to calculate regulatory capital ratios. The
Basel III Capital Rules became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2015, subject to a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">phase-in</FONT> period for certain provisions. The need to maintain more capital than has been historically required and calculated under
revised standards could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also depress our return on equity, thereby making it more difficult to earn our cost of
capital. Moreover, although these new requirements are being <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">phased-in</FONT> over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account future expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these
new requirements, including under stress conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividends and acquisitions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Due to the importance and complexity of the stress test process and new capital rules calculations under Basel III, we have dedicated
additional resources to comply with these requirements. No assurance can be provided, however, that these resources will be deemed sufficient or that we will be deemed to have adequate capital under the hypothetical economic stress scenarios, which
would affect our ability to take certain capital actions in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as
possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control of the
Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire
Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two -thirds of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have the effect of
making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the
additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might
realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have material

loan portfolio represented by commercial real estate and construction loans. This type of lending is generally considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional single-family residential or consumer lending because the principal is
concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful operation or completion of the related real estate or construction project. Consequently, these loans are more sensitive to the current adverse conditions in the
real estate market and the general economy. These loans are generally less predictable, more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and their collateral may be more difficult to dispose of in a market decline. Furthermore, since these loans are to
Puerto Rico-based borrowers, Popular&#146;s credit exposure concentration in Puerto Rico increased as a result of the acquisition. Although the negative economic aspects of these risks were substantially reduced as a result of the FDIC loss sharing
agreements, changes in economic conditions have led and could continue to lead to higher loan charge-offs in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction all of which could not be totally supported by the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. </P>

economic conditions, including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, have increased and may continue to increase the level of charge-offs on the
loan portfolio that we have acquired and correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if other favorable
events occur. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC which provide that 80% of losses related to specified loan
portfolios that we acquired in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction would be borne by the FDIC, we are not protected for all losses resulting from charge-offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios. Additionally, the loss sharing
agreements have limited terms, and the one applicable to commercial loans expired on June&nbsp;30, 2015. Therefore, any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">charge-off</FONT> of related losses that we experience after the term of the loss sharing
agreements will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negatively impact our results of operations. The loss sharing agreements also impose standard requirements on us which must be satisfied in order to retain loss share protections. The FDIC has
the right to refuse or delay payment for loan losses if the loss sharing agreements are not managed in accordance with their terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our decisions

acquired loan portfolios, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, we recorded a loss share
indemnification asset that we consider adequate to absorb future losses which may occur in the acquired loan portfolio. In determining the size of the loss share indemnification asset, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss
experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and
increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio. Any increase in future loan losses could have a negative effect on our operating results. To the extent that
estimated losses on the Westernbank portfolio were (for the commercial loss share agreement, which expired in 2015) or are (for the single-family loss share agreement, which expires on June&nbsp;30, 2020) not realized before the expiration of the
loss sharing agreements, such losses would not be subject to reimbursement from the FDIC and, accordingly, would require us to make a material adjustment to the value of our loss share indemnification asset and the related true up payment obligation
to the FDIC, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which such adjustment is taken. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Refer

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BPPR&#146;s loss share agreements with the FDIC specify that disputes can be submitted to arbitration before a review board under the
commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Since 2012, BPPR and the FDIC have engaged in various disputes with respect to the Westernbank commercial loss share agreement, including with respect to the methodology for the
computation of charge-offs, the restructuring and modification of certain covered real estate loans, the interpretation of the provision governing portfolio sales and BPPR&#146;s maximization of collections on shared-loss assets. Please refer to our
Legal Proceedings discussion in Note 28<B> </B>for a description of these historical and active disputes in connection with the Westernbank loss-share agreements with the FDIC. Certain of these disputes have been submitted to arbitration. During
2016, BPPR received adverse decisions in two separate arbitration proceedings with respect to the Westernbank commercial loss share agreement in which BPPR had sought damages in the amount of $55&nbsp;million and $88.5&nbsp;million, respectively. As
a result of such arbitration decisions, Popular had to recognize during 2016 a pre-tax charge of approximately $171.8 million in connection with unreimbursed losses considered in the arbitration proceedings, the related adjustment to the true-up
obligation owed to the FDIC at the end of the loss-share agreements in 2020 and recoveries previously incorporated in the net damages claimed in the arbitration. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, on November&nbsp;12, 2015, the FDIC notified BPPR that it (a)&nbsp;would deny certain claims included in BPPR&#146;s quarterly
certificate for the second quarter of 2015 and (b)&nbsp;withhold payment of approximately $5.5&nbsp;million attributed to the $6.9&nbsp;million in losses BPPR claimed thereunder. In support of its denial, the FDIC alleged that BPPR did not comply
with its obligation under the commercial loss share agreement, including compliance with certain provisions of GAAP, acting in accordance with prudent banking practices, managing Shared-Loss Assets in the same manner as BPPR&#146;s <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-Shared-Loss</FONT> Assets, and using best efforts to maximize collections on the Shared-Loss Assets. BPPR disagrees with the FDIC&#146;s allegations, and accordingly, on January&nbsp;27, 2016 delivered to the FDIC a
notice of dispute under the commercial loss share agreement and on May&nbsp;20, 2016 filed a demand for arbitration to resolve such dispute and award BPPR damages in the amount of $4.9&nbsp;million. On February&nbsp;10, 2017, BPPR withdrew one of
its claims, as a result of which its damages demand was reduced to approximately $4.3&nbsp;million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;16, 2016, the FDIC
initiated a proceeding before the same panel that sat on a prior arbitration proceeding between BPPR and the FDIC that resulted in a settlement among the parties dated as of October 2014. The panel&#146;s chair also sat on the December 2015 Dispute
that resulted in an adverse award for BPPR. Through this proceeding, the FDIC sought to claw back a $12.6&nbsp;million reimbursement paid on one of the Shared-Loss Assets at issue in the January 2016 Dispute. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;23, 2017, the FDIC and BPPR entered into a settlement in principle whereby the parties agreed to withdraw both the January
2016 and the December 2016 Disputes in exchange for a payment by BPPR to the FDIC of approximately $5.5&nbsp;million. Such settlement is still subject to the delivery of definite documentation. The Corporation does not expect such payment to have a

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">denial-of-service</FONT></FONT> and computer intrusion that might result in loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds from customer or bank accounts. <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Denial-of-service</FONT></FONT> disrupts services available to our customers through our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-line</FONT> banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might
result in the breach of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains
heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats from organized cybercriminals and hackers, and our plans to continue to provide e-banking and mobile banking services to our customers. We have not, to date, experienced any
material losses as a result of cyber-attacks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If personal, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-public,</FONT> confidential or
proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such
information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, including those of EVERTEC, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise
inappropriately taken by third parties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. </B></P>

transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. Our main provider of these components is EVERTEC. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any
problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or
poor performance of services, failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a
third-party vendor, including EVERTEC, as discussed below, could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor&#146;s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and
expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A significant portion of our operations are located in a region susceptible to hurricanes. Such weather events can cause disruption to our
operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. We maintain hurricane insurance, including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there is no insurance against the disruption to the markets
that we serve that a catastrophic hurricane could produce. Further, a hurricane in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Man-made</FONT> disasters and other events connected with the regions in which we operate could have similar effects. The severity and impact of future hurricanes and other weather-related events are difficult to predict
and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The effects of future hurricanes and other weather-related events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>RISKS RELATING TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERTEC </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We
are dependent on EVERTEC for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the sale of a 51% ownership interest in EVERTEC in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a long-term Amended and
Restated Master Services Agreement (the &#147;MSA&#148;) with EVERTEC, pursuant to which we agreed to receive from EVERTEC, on an exclusive basis, certain core financial transaction processing and information technology services, including future
modifications and enhancements to such services. The term of the MSA extends until September 30, 2025. Under the MSA, we also granted EVERTEC a right of first refusal to create new services or products that we determine to offer to our customers and
certain other processing services. We also entered into several other agreements, generally coterminous with the MSA, pursuant to which BPPR agreed to sponsor EVERTEC as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card
associations, agreed to certain exclusivity and non-solicitation restrictions with respect to merchant services, and agreed to support the ATH brand and network, among other matters. As a result, we are now dependent on EVERTEC for the provision of
essential services to our business, including our core banking business, and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that EVERTEC will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary financial
transaction processing and technology services. As a result, our relationship with EVERTEC exposes us to a number of operational and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, as a result of our agreements with EVERTEC, we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of EVERTEC, including those
relating to a breakdown or failure of EVERTEC&#146;s systems, as a result of security breaches or attacks, employee error or malfeasance, system breakdowns, or otherwise. Over the term of the MSA, we have experienced various interruptions and delays
in key services provided by EVERTEC. Future interruptions in the operation of EVERTEC&#146;s information systems, or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery
of services and damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to recover from EVERTEC for breach of the MSA may not fully compensate us for the damages we may
suffer as a result of such breach. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>If EVERTEC is unable to meet constant technological changes and evolving industry standards, we may be unable to
enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The banking and financial services industry is rapidly evolving and it is highly competitive on the basis of the quality and variety of
products and services offered, innovation, price and other factors. In order to compete effectively, we need to constantly develop enhancements to our product and service offerings and introduce new products and services that keep pace with
developments in the financial services industry and satisfy shifting customer needs and preferences. These enhancements and new products and services require the delivery of technology services by EVERTEC pursuant to the MSA, making our success
dependent on EVERTEC&#146;s ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a cost-effective manner. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than EVERTEC and that may have
better technological capabilities and product offerings. Furthermore, EVERTEC is highly leveraged, which, besides exposing it to a number of financial and business risks, requires it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to meeting debt
service requirements, reducing its operational flexibility and ability to invest resources in capital and other expenditures to improve and develop its business services in a constantly changing environment. In addition, financial services
technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers&#146; compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, and in most cases
such costs are borne by the technology provider. Because of our relationship with EVERTEC, however, we bear the full cost of such developments and modifications pursuant to the MSA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If EVERTEC&#146;s technology services are not competitive in terms of price, speed and scalability versus comparable offerings from larger
companies, our future success may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if our relationship with EVERTEC hinders our ability to compete successfully, including by satisfying shifting customer needs and preferences through enhancements to our existing
products and services and the introduction of new products and services that keep pace with developments in the financial services industry, our ability to attract and retain customers and to match products and services offered by competitors could
be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our ability to transition to a new financial services
technology provider, and to replace the other services that are provided to us by EVERTEC, may be lengthy and complex. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Switching from
one vendor of core bank processing and related technology services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks, even where such a switch can be accomplished without violating our contractual obligations to EVERTEC.
The implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us. Such a transition can also expose us, and our clients, to increased costs (including conversion costs) and business
disruption. If we decided to transition to a new financial services technology provider, either at the end of the term of the MSA and related agreements or earlier upon the occurrence of a termination event, these potential transition risks could
result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although EVERTEC has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the MSA, we are ultimately dependent on
their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the MSA we are required to provide written notice of
non-renewal not less than one year prior to the relevant termination date in order to avoid an automatic three-year renewal. In practice, however, if we decided to switch to a new provider, we would have to commence procuring and working on a
transition process much earlier. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources, it could also result in an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the revenues we derive from EVERTEC, could be
materially reduced if we decided not to renew our agreements with EVERTEC or were to terminate them before the expiration of their term. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We continue to have a 16.05% ownership interest in EVERTEC and account for this investment under the equity method. As such, we include our
investment in EVERTEC in other assets and our proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations. For 2016, our share of EVERTEC&#146;s changes in equity recognized in income was
$11.2 million. The carrying value of our investment in EVERTEC was, as of December 31, 2016, approximately $38.9 million. Meanwhile, the services EVERTEC delivers to us represent a significant portion of EVERTEC&#146;s revenues (approximately 45%
for 2016). As a result, if we were not to renew the MSA and our other agreements with EVERTEC, or otherwise terminate them before the end of their term, EVERTEC&#146;s financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected and the value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the income we report from this investment, may be materially reduced. Furthermore, revenue from EVERTEC&#146;s merchant acquiring business, which constitutes approximately
23% of EVERTEC&#146;s revenues, depends, in part, on EVERTEC&#146;s alliance with BPPR. If such relationship were to suffer, EVERTEC&#146;s business may be adversely affected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, future sales of our EVERTEC common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price
of EVERTEC common stock and thus the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For further information of other risks faced

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All series of Preferred Stock are pari passu. Dividends on each series of Preferred Stock are payable if declared by our Board of Directors.
Our ability to declare and pay dividends on the Preferred Stock is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends. The Board of Directors is not
obligated to declare dividends and dividends do not accumulate in the event they are not paid. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Monthly dividends on the Preferred Stock
amounted $3.7 million for 2016. Popular committed to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to fund the preferred dividend payments out of newly-issued Common Stock issued to employees under Popular&#146;s existing savings and
investment plans or, if such issuances were insufficient, other common equity capital raised by Popular. During 2016 the Common Stock issued under those plans was $5.5 million that was well above the dividend payment. During 2017, Popular no longer
intends to fund its preferred dividend payments out of newly issued common stock and, as a result, any preferred dividend payments will have to be compliant with applicable regulatory guidance. There can be no assurance that any dividends will be
declared on the Preferred Stock in any future periods. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan </B></P>

the Common Stock at a 5% discount from the average market price at the time of the issuance, as well as purchase shares of Common Stock directly from Popular by making optional cash payments at prevailing market prices. </P>
