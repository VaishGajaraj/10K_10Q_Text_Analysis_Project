<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular, Inc. (the &#147;Corporation&#148;) is a diversified, publicly owned bank
holding company, registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the &#147;BHC Act&#148;) and, accordingly, subject to the supervision and
regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;the
Federal Reserve Board&#148;). The Corporation was incorporated in 1984 under the
laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and is the largest financial
institution in Puerto Rico, with consolidated assets of $36.4&nbsp;billion, total
deposits of $18.1&nbsp;billion and stockholders&#146; equity of $2.8&nbsp;billion at December
31, 2003. Based on total assets at December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Corporation was the
31th largest bank holding company in the United States.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s principal subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico
(&#147;Banco Popular&#148; or the &#147;Bank&#148;), was incorporated in 1893 and is Puerto Rico&#146;s
largest bank with consolidated total assets of $22.2&nbsp;billion, deposits of $13.3
billion and stockholder&#146;s equity of $1.8&nbsp;billion at December&nbsp;31, 2003. The Bank
accounted for 61% of the total consolidated assets of the Corporation at
December&nbsp;31, 2003. A consumer-oriented bank, Banco Popular has the largest
retail franchise in Puerto Rico, operating 193 branches and over 550 automated
teller machines. The Bank has the largest trust operation in Puerto Rico. The
Bank also operates seven branches in the U.S. Virgin Islands, one branch in the
British Virgin Islands and one branch in New York. Banco Popular&#146;s deposits are
insured under the Bank Insurance Fund (&#147;BIF&#148;) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the &#147;FDIC&#148;). Banco Popular has three subsidiaries, Popular Auto,
Inc., Puerto Rico&#146;s largest vehicle financing, leasing and daily rental
company, Popular Finance, Inc., a small-loan and second mortgage company with
36 offices and seven mortgage centers in Puerto Rico, and Popular Mortgage,
Inc., a mortgage loan company with 32 offices in Puerto Rico.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation has three other principal subsidiaries: Popular
Securities, Inc., Popular International Bank, Inc. (&#147;PIB&#148;) and GM Group, Inc.
Popular Securities, Inc. is a securities broker-dealer in Puerto Rico with
financial advisory, investment and security brokerage operations for
institutional and retail customers. PIB owns the outstanding stock of Popular
North America, Inc. (&#147;PNA&#148;), ATH Costa Rica, CreST, S.A. and Popular Insurance V.I.,
Inc., an insurance agency. ATH Costa Rica and CreST, S.A. provide ATM switching and

Rico, Venezuela, Miami and the Dominican Republic. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, GM
Group, Inc. had total assets of $118&nbsp;million. Effective November&nbsp;30, 2003, the
Corporation acquired the remaining 15% minority interest in Levitt Mortgage
Corporation (&#147;Levitt&#148;). Through this acquisition Levitt is now a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Corporation. Levitt is a mortgage loan company with
operations in Puerto Rico and with assets of $52.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31,
2003. In addition, during 2003 two other wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Corporation were incorporated; Popular RE, Inc., a reinsurance company, and
Popular Capital Trust 1, a statutory business trust.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PIB is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation organized in 1992 that

Center Regulatory Act of Puerto Rico (the &#147;IBC Act&#148;). PIB is a registered bank
holding company under the BHC Act and is principally engaged in providing

Through this investment PIB owns 54% of Contado.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PNA, a wholly owned subsidiary of PIB and an indirect wholly-owned

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">U.S. operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, PNA had five direct
subsidiaries, all of which were wholly-owned: Banco Popular North America
(&#147;BPNA&#148;), a full service commercial bank incorporated in the state of New York,
Equity One, Inc., a diversified consumer finance company, Popular Cash Express,
Inc., a retail financial services company, BanPonce Trust I, a statutory
business trust, and Banco Popular, National Association (&#147;Banco Popular,
N.A.&#148;), a federally chartered national bank with its main office in Orlando,
Florida, which as of December&nbsp;31, 2003, operated one branch, with assets of $47
million and deposits of $19.3&nbsp;million. Popular Insurance, Inc., a wholly-owned
non-bank subsidiary of Banco Popular, N.A. and an indirect subsidiary of PNA,
is a general insurance agency that offers insurance products in Puerto Rico. As
of December&nbsp;31, 2003, its assets amounted to $32.9&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking operations of BPNA in the mainland United States are based in
six states. In New York, BPNA operated 32 branches, which accounted for
aggregate assets of $2.6&nbsp;billion and total deposits of $2.3&nbsp;billion at December
31, 2003. BPNA also operated 19 branches in Illinois and 16 in California with
total assets of $1.6&nbsp;billion and $654&nbsp;million, respectively, and deposits of
$1.4&nbsp;billion and $392.3&nbsp;million, respectively. In addition, BPNA had 13
branches in New Jersey with total assets of $299.5&nbsp;million and deposits of
$601.8&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2003 and ten branches in Florida with total
assets of $363.2&nbsp;million and deposits of $277.1&nbsp;million. In Texas, BPNA
operated seven branches with aggregate assets of $741.6&nbsp;million and total
deposits of $142.6&nbsp;million at the same date. The deposits of BPNA are insured
under the BIF by the FDIC.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, BPNA owned all of the outstanding stock of Popular Leasing,
USA, a non-banking subsidiary that offers small ticket equipment leasing with
11 offices in nine states and total assets of $252.4&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,
2003. Popular FS, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of BPNA, began operations in
2003. Popular FS, LLC is engaged in the business of purchasing mortgage loans
and its assets totaled $180.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2003. Popular Insurance
Agency USA, Inc. is also a wholly owned subsidiary of BPNA. Popular Insurance
Agency USA, Inc. acts as an agent or broker for issuing insurance and began
operations in January&nbsp;2002. Its assets totaled $1&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,
2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equity One, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PNA, is engaged in the
business of granting personal and mortgage loans and providing dealer financing
through 181 offices in 26 states. It had total assets of $6.7&nbsp;billion as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003. Popular Cash Express, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
PNA, offers services such as check cashing, money transfers to other countries,
money order sales and processing of payments through 129 offices in
five states. Its assets totaled $77.7&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31,
2003. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Popular Cash Express, Inc. sold its
mobile check cashing unit&#146;s operation in California.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Competition</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of banking is highly competitive. In addition to competition
from other commercial banks, banks face significant competition from nonbank
financial institutions. Savings associations compete aggressively with
commercial banks for deposits and loans. Credit unions and finance companies
are significant players in the consumer loan market. Investment firms and
retailers are significant competitors for some types of business. Banks compete
for deposits with a broad spectrum of other types of investments such as mutual
funds, stocks and debt securities of corporations, and debt securities of the
federal government, state governments and their respective agencies. The
principal methods of competition for financial services are price (interest
rates paid on deposits, interest rates charged on borrowings and fees charged
for services) and service (convenience and quality of services rendered to
customers).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s business is described on pages 1 through 29 of the
Business Review Section of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>REGULATION AND SUPERVISION</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>General</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation, PIB and PNA are bank holding companies subject to
supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act.
Under the BHC Act, prior to the adoption of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act in 1999,
the activities of bank holding companies and their banking and non-banking
subsidiaries were limited to the business of banking and activities closely
related to banking, and no bank holding company could directly or indirectly
acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares or
substantially all of the assets of any company in the United States, including
a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In addition,
bank holding companies generally have been prohibited under the BHC Act from
engaging in non-banking activities, unless they were found by the Federal
Reserve Board to be closely related to banking. See &#147;&#150; Financial Services
Modernization&#148; below for information regarding changes to these rules.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular is considered a foreign bank for purposes of the
International Banking Act of 1978 (the &#147;IBA&#148;). Under the IBA, Banco Popular is
not permitted to operate a branch or agency that is located outside of its
&#147;home state&#148;, except to the extent that a national bank with the same home
state is permitted to do so as described under &#147;-Interstate Banking
Legislation&#148; below. Puerto Rico is not considered a state for purposes of these
geographic limitations. Banco Popular has designated the state of New York as
its home state.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to supervision and
examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies including, in the
case of Banco Popular, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the
Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico, in the case of BPNA, the
Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking Department and in the case
of Banco Popular, N.A., the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#147;OCC&#148;).
Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to requirements and
restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain
reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that
may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon, and limitations on
the other types of investments that may be made and the types of services that
may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the
operations of Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. See &#147;&#150; Financial
Services Modernization&#148; below for information about changes made to these
rules. In addition to the impact of regulations, commercial banks are affected
significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts to
control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the
economy.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Prompt Corrective Action</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDIA&#148;) requires among other
things, the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in
respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital
requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital tiers: &#147;well capitalized&#148;,
&#147;adequately capitalized&#148;, &#147;undercapitalized&#148;, &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;,
and &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148;. The relevant capital measures are the total
risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the leverage
ratio.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies provide that a depository
institution will be deemed to be (1)&nbsp;well capitalized if it maintains a
leverage ratio of at least 5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%
and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and is not subject to any
written agreement or directive to meet a specific capital level; (2)&nbsp;adequately
capitalized, if it is not well capitalized, but maintains a leverage ratio of
at least 4% (or at least 3% if given the highest regulatory rating and not
experiencing or anticipating significant growth), a Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio of at least 4% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%; (3)
undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized
institutions (unless it is deemed significantly or critically
undercapitalized); (4)&nbsp;significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage
ratio of less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3% or a
total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%; and (5)&nbsp;critically
undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to 2% or less of total assets.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2003, Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. were all
well capitalized. An institution&#146;s capital category, as determined by applying
the prompt corrective action provisions of law, may not constitute an accurate
representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of the
institution, and the capital condition of the Corporation&#146;s banking
subsidiaries should be considered in conjunction with other available
information regarding the Corporation&#146;s financial condition and results of
operations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances,
reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately
capitalized. The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately
capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory
provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat
a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized)
based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the
institution.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the
appropriate federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for
hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the
institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any
capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management
fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be
undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to
restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition,
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and
are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution&#146;s
holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the
lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at the time it becomes
undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution
fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a
capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on
realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository
institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an
acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.
Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a
number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient
voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total
assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment
of a receiver or conservator.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to
FDIC-insured depository institutions such as Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco
Popular, N.A., but they are not directly applicable to holding companies such
as the Corporation, PIB and PNA, which control such institutions. However, the
federal banking agencies have indicated that, in regulating holding companies,
they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their
assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary
insured depository institutions pursuant to such provisions and regulations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Holding Company Structure</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to restrictions
under federal law that limit the transfer of funds by any of them to the
Corporation, PIB, PNA, or any of the Corporation&#146;s other non-banking
subsidiaries, whether in the form of loans, other extensions of credit,
investments or asset purchases. Such transfers by Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco
Popular, N.A. to any of the Corporation, PIB, PNA, or any non-banking
subsidiaries are limited in amount to 10% of the transferring institution&#146;s
capital stock and surplus and, with respect to the Corporation and all of its
non-banking subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the transferring
institution&#146;s capital stock and surplus. For these purposes an institution&#146;s
capital stock and surplus includes its total risk-based capital plus (1)&nbsp;the
balance of its allowance for loan losses not included therein and (2)&nbsp;the
amount of certain investments made by the institution in &#147;financial
subsidiaries&#148; that is required to be deducted from the institution&#146;s capital
for

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, any such loans and extensions of
credit are required to be secured in specified amounts. In addition, federal
law requires that any transaction between Banco Popular, BPNA or Banco Popular,
N.A., on the one hand, and the Corporation, PIB, PNA or any of the
Corporation&#146;s other non-banking subsidiaries, on the other hand, be carried out
on an arm&#146;s length basis.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company such as the
Corporation, PIB or PNA is expected to act as a source of financial strength to
each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each subsidiary
bank. This support may be required at times when, absent such policy, the bank
holding company might not otherwise provide such support. In addition, any
capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository
institutions are subordinated in right of payment to deposits and to certain
other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository institution. In the event of a
bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company
to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository
institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
priority of payment. Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are currently
the only depository institution subsidiaries of the Corporation, PIB and PNA.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Corporation, PIB and PNA are holding companies, their right to
participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#146;s liquidation or
reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#146;s
creditors (including depositors in the case of subsidiary depository
institutions) except to the extent that the Corporation, PIB or PNA, as the
case may be, may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the
subsidiary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the FDIA, a depository institution, the deposits of which are
insured by the FDIC, can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably
expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i)&nbsp;the default of a
commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii)&nbsp;any assistance
provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository
institution &#147;in danger of default&#148;. &#147;Default&#148; is defined generally as the
appointment of a conservator or a receiver, and &#147;in danger of default&#148; is
defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a
default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. Banco
Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are currently FDIC-insured depository
institution subsidiaries of the Corporation and are subject to this
cross-guarantee liability. In some circumstances (depending upon the amount of
the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the FDIC), cross-guarantee liability
may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more insured
depository institutions in a holding company structure. Any obligation or
liability owed by a subsidiary depository institution to its parent company is
subordinated to the subsidiary depository institution&#146;s cross-guarantee
liability with respect to commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository
institutions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Dividend Restrictions</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal source of cash flow for the Corporation is dividends from
Banco Popular. Various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends Banco
Popular may pay to the Corporation without regulatory approval. As a member
bank subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, Banco Popular must
obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total
of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would
exceed the total of its net income (as reportable in its Report of Condition
and Income), for that year, combined with its retained net income (as defined
by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to
surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a
member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its
undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the
member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member
bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn
unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. For this
purpose, permanent capital means the total of the bank&#146;s perpetual preferred
stock and related surplus, common stock and surplus and minority interests in
consolidated subsidiaries, as reportable in the Report of Condition and Income.
At December&nbsp;31, 2003, Banco Popular could have declared a dividend of
approximately $156&nbsp;million without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment of dividends by Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A.
may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies, such as the
maintenance of adequate capital. If, in the opinion of the applicable
regulatory authority, a depository institution under its jurisdiction is
engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (that,
depending on the financial condition of the depository institution, could
include the payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and
hearing, that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice.
In addition, all FDIC-insured depository institutions are subject to the
capital-based limitations required by the FDIA. See &#147;-Prompt Corrective Action&#148;
above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See &#147;&#150;Puerto Rico Regulation-General&#148; below for a description of certain
restrictions on Banco Popular&#146;s ability to pay dividends under Puerto Rico law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>FDIC Insurance Assessments</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular, BPNA and Banco Popular, N.A. are subject to FDIC deposit
insurance assessments. Pursuant to the FDIA, the FDIC has adopted a risk-based
assessment system, under which the assessment rate for an insured depository
institution varies according to the level of risk incurred in its activities.
An institution&#146;s risk category is based partly upon whether the institution is
well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized.
Each FDIC-insured depository institution is also assigned to one of the
following &#147;supervisory subgroups&#148;: &#147;A&#148;, &#147;B&#148; or &#147;C&#148;. Group &#147;A&#148; institutions are
financially sound institutions with only a few minor weaknesses; Group &#147;B&#148;
institutions are institutions that demonstrate weaknesses that, if not
corrected, could result in significant deterioration; and Group &#147;C&#148;
institutions are institutions for which there is a substantial probability that
the FDIC will suffer a loss in connection with the institution unless effective
action is taken to correct the areas of weakness.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently premiums related to deposits assessed by both the BIF and the
Savings Association Insurance Fund (&#147;SAIF&#148;) are to be assessed at an annual
rate of between 0 cents and 27 cents per $100.00 of deposits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 also separated the Financing
Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;) assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations
from the BIF and SAIF assessments. The amount assessed on individual
institutions by the FICO is in addition to the amount, if any, paid for deposit
insurance according to the FDIC&#146;s risk-related assessment rate schedules. The
current FICO annual assessment rate is 1.54 cents per $100 of deposits. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2003, the Corporation had a BIF deposit assessment base of
approximately $17.6&nbsp;billion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of favorable loss experience and a healthy reserve ratio in the
BIF, well capitalized and well managed banks, including the Corporation&#146;s bank
subsidiaries, have in recent years paid no premiums for FDIC insurance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, even well capitalized and well managed banks may be
required to pay premiums on deposit insurance. It is not possible to determine
when any such premiums will become assessable or the level of such premiums.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Brokered Deposits</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FDIC regulations adopted under FDIA govern the receipt of brokered
deposits. Under these regulations, a bank cannot accept, roll over or renew
brokered deposits (which term is defined also to include any deposit with an
interest rate more than 75 basis points above prevailing rates) unless (i)&nbsp;it
is well capitalized or (ii)&nbsp;it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver
from the FDIC. A bank that is adequately capitalized may not pay an interest
rate on any deposits in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing
market rates specified by regulation. There are no such restrictions on a bank
that is well capitalized. The Corporation does not believe the brokered
deposits regulation has had or will have a material effect on the funding or
liquidity of Banco Popular, BPNA or Banco Popular, N.A.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information about the capital composition of the Corporation as of
December&nbsp;31, 2003 and for the four previous years is presented in Table H
&#147;Capital Adequacy Data&#148; on page 18 in the &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; (MD&#038;A).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s risk-based capital guidelines for bank
holding companies and member banks, the minimum ratio of qualifying total
capital (&#147;Total Capital&#148;) to risk-weighted assets (including certain
off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least
half of the Total Capital is to be comprised of common equity, retained
earnings, minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries,
qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of
cumulative perpetual preferred stock less goodwill and certain other intangible
assets (&#147;Tier 1 Capital&#148;). The remainder may consist of a limited amount of
subordinated debt, other preferred stock, certain other instruments and a
limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves (&#147;Tier 2 Capital&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage
ratio guidelines for bank holding companies and member banks. These guidelines
provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total assets, less goodwill
and certain other intangible assets discussed below (the &#147;leverage ratio&#148;) of
3% for bank holding companies and member banks that have the highest regulatory
rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s market risk capital
measure. All other bank holding companies and member banks are required to
maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. The guidelines also provide that
banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are
expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum
supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.
Furthermore, the guidelines indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will
continue to consider a &#147;tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio&#148; and other indicia of
capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. The
tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization&#146;s Tier 1
Capital less all intangibles, to total assets less all intangibles.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to the risk-based and leverage capital
requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Banco Popular, N.A. is
subject to substantially similar requirements of the OCC. See Consolidated
Financial Statements, Note 20 &#147;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#148; on page 61 for
the capital ratios of the Corporation, Banco Popular and BPNA. Failure to meet
capital guidelines could subject the Corporation and its depository institution
subsidiaries to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of
deposit insurance by the FDIC and to certain restrictions on its business. See
"-Prompt Corrective Action&#148;.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies&#146; risk-capital guidelines are
based upon the 1988 capital accord of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (the &#147;BSC&#148;). The BSC is a committee of central banks and bank
supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops
broad policy guidelines that each country&#146;s supervisors can use to determine
the supervisory policies they apply. In January&nbsp;2001 the BSC released a
proposal to replace the 1988 capital accord with a new capital accord that
would set capital requirements for operational risk and refine the existing
capital requirements for credit risk and market risk exposures. The 1988
capital accord does not include separate capital requirements for operational
risk, which is defined under the proposed accord to mean the risk of direct or
indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people
and systems or from external events. The BSC has stated that its objective is
to finalize a new accord by mid-year 2004 and for implementation in each member
country of the new framework at year end 2006.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate timing for a new accord, and the specifics of a number of
factors under the new accord, including the capital assessments for addressing
operational risk, are still undergoing changes in response to industry,
national and regulatory commentary. However, the Corporation expects that a new
capital accord will eventually be adopted by the BSC and implemented by the
federal banking agencies. At this time the Corporation cannot determine with
certainty whether the capital requirements that may arise

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#147;FASB&#148;)
issued FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
(&#147;FIN 46&#148;), which addresses the consolidation rules to be applied to &#147;variable
interest entities&#148; as defined in FIN 46. In December&nbsp;2003 the FASB amended FIN
46 in FASB interpretation No.&nbsp;46 (revised December&nbsp;2003) (&#147;FIN 46R&#148;). FIN 46R,
applies to certain variable interest entities by no later than March&nbsp;15, 2004.
Under FIN 46R issuer trusts may constitute variable interest entities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, issuer trusts that issued trust preferred securities have
been consolidated by their parent companies and the accounts of such issuer
trusts have been included in the consolidated financial statements of such
parent companies. In addition, trust preferred securities have been treated as
eligible for Tier 1 capital treatment by bank holding companies under Federal
Reserve rules and regulations relating to minority interests in equity accounts
of consolidated subsidiaries. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003, $444,000,000 in trust
preferred securities were outstanding that the Corporation treated as Tier 1
capital under existing Federal Reserve Board guidelines. The Corporation has
determined that the issuer trusts for its trust preferred securities
transactions are variable interest entities. The variable interest entities
were deconsolidated commencing with the Corporation&#146;s December&nbsp;31, 2003
financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2003, the Federal Reserve Board indicated that trust preferred
securities would continue to be treated as Tier 1 capital until notice is given
to the contrary and that it would review the regulatory implications of any
accounting treatment changes and would provide further guidance if necessary or
warranted. The Federal Reserve Board staff has indicated that the Federal
Reserve Board is continuing to assess the consequences of deconsolidation of
trust preferred securities under FIN 46R on their Tier 1 capital treatment. At
this time, the Corporation cannot predict whether the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s
continuing assessment will result in any changes in the capital treatment of
its trust preferred securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Interstate Banking Legislation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994
permits a bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board approval, to acquire
banks located in states other than the holding company&#146;s home state without
regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law. In addition,
national and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge
across state lines, with approval of the appropriate federal banking agency.
States are also allowed to permit de novo interstate branching. Once a bank has
established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the
bank may establish or acquire additional branches at any location in the state
where any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have
established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. A bank
that has established a branch in a state through de novo branching (if
permitted under state laws) may establish and acquire additional branches in
such state in the same manner and to the same extent as a bank having a branch
in such state as a result of an interstate merger. If a state opted out of
interstate branching within the specified time period, no bank in any other
state may establish a branch in the state that has opted out, whether through
an acquisition or de novo. A foreign bank, like Banco Popular, may establish
branches interstate, by merger or de novo, to the same extent as a domestic
bank in the foreign bank&#146;s home state, which, in the case of Banco Popular, is
New York.

holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations.
This part of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act became effective on March&nbsp;11, 2000.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a bank holding company to engage in the broader range of
activities that are permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (i)&nbsp;all of its
depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized (as described
above) and well managed and (ii)&nbsp;it must file a declaration with the Federal
Reserve Board that it elects to be a &#147;financial holding company.&#148; A depository
institution is deemed to be &#147;well managed&#148; if at its most recent inspection,
examination or subsequent review by the appropriate federal banking agency (or
the appropriate state banking agency), the depository institution received at
least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; composite rating and at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating
for management. In addition, to commence any new activity permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and to acquire any company engaged in any new activities
permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, each insured depository institution
subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received at least a
&#147;satisfactory&#148; rating in its most recent examination under the Community
Reinvestment Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election by the Corporation, PIB and PNA to become financial holding
companies became effective April&nbsp;30, 2002.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also modified other laws, including laws
related to financial privacy and community reinvestment. The new financial
privacy provisions generally prohibit financial institutions, including the
Corporation&#146;s bank subsidiaries, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial
information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to &#147;opt out&#148;
of the disclosure.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;26, 2001, the President signed into law comprehensive
anti-terrorism legislation known as the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the USA
Patriot Act&#148;). Title III of the USA Patriot Act substantially broadened the
scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing
significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes
and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United
States.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Treasury Department (&#147;Treasury&#148;) has issued a number of
regulations implementing the USA Patriot Act that apply certain of its
requirements to financial institutions, including the Corporation&#146;s bank
subsidiaries. The regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions
to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent
and report money laundering and terrorist financing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA Patriot Act&#146;s
requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the
institution. The Corporation believes that the cost of compliance with Title
III of the USA Patriot Act is not likely to be material to the Corporation


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Community Reinvestment Act</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to help serve the credit
needs of their communities, including credit to low and moderate income
individuals and geographies. Should the Corporation or its bank subsidiaries
fail to serve adequately the community, potential penalties may include
regulatory denials of applications to expand branches, relocate, add
subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge
with or purchase other financial institutions.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various other legislation, including proposals to limit the investments
that a depository institution may make with insured funds, is from time to time

have upon its financial condition or results of operations.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Puerto Rico Regulation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>General. </I></B>As a commercial bank organized under the laws of Puerto Rico,
Banco Popular is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the
Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico (the
&#147;Office of the Commissioner&#148;), pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking Act of 1933,
as amended (the &#147;Banking Law&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of
the yearly net income of Banco Popular be credited annually to a reserve fund.
This apportionment must be done every year until the reserve fund is equal to
the total of paid-in capital on common and preferred stock. At the end of 2003
Banco Popular transferred $25.5&nbsp;million to the reserve fund in order to comply
with this requirement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of
a bank are greater than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter
must be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance,
if any, must be charged against the reserve fund. If the reserve fund is not
sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount
must be charged against the capital account and no dividend may be declared
until capital has been restored to its original amount and the reserve fund to
20% of the original capital.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal
reserve that, except as otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner,
may not be less than 20% of its demand liabilities, excluding government
deposits (federal, state and municipal) which are secured by collateral. If a
bank is authorized to establish one or more bank branches in a state of the
United States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the
reserve requirements of that state or country, the Office of the Commissioner
may exempt said branch or branches from the reserve requirements of Section&nbsp;16.
Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated November&nbsp;24, 1982,
Banco Popular has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal
Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly,
Banco Popular is subject to the reserve requirements prescribed by the Banking
Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to any one
person, firm, partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of fifteen
percent (15%) of the paid-in capital and reserve fund of the bank. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2003, the legal lending limit for the Bank under this provision
was approximately $143&nbsp;million. The above limitations do not apply to loans
which are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the
loan up to a maximum aggregate amount of one third of the paid-in capital of
the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the institution is well capitalized and had
been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the Office of the
Commissioner or any regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also
include 15% of 50% of its undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral
worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank
shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided profits. Institutions rated
2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional component in
their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of
the Commissioner. There are no restrictions under Section&nbsp;17 on the amount of
loans that are wholly secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of
indebtedness of the Government of the United States or Puerto Rico, or by
current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or instrumentalities of
Puerto Rico.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;14 of the Banking Law authorizes a bank to conduct certain
financial and related activities directly or through subsidiaries, including
finance leasing of personal property, originating and servicing mortgage loans
and operating a small loan company. Banco Popular engages in these activities
through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Popular Auto, Inc., Popular Mortgage,
Inc. and Popular Finance, Inc., respectively, all of which are organized and
operate in Puerto Rico.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Board, which includes as its members the Commissioner of
Financial Institutions, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of
Commerce, the Secretary of Consumer Affairs, the President of the Planning
Board, and the President of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico,

the international banking entity, in which case notification to the Office of
the Commissioner must be given within ten business days following the date of
the issue. Pursuant to the IBC Act, without the prior approval of the Office
of the Commissioner, PIB may not initiate the sale, encumbrance, assignment,
merger or other transfer of shares if by such transaction a person or persons
acting in concert could acquire direct or indirect control of 10% or more of
any class of PIB&#146;s stock. Such authorization must be requested at least 30
days prior to the transaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PIB must submit to the Office of the Commissioner a report of its

condition and results of operation on a quarterly basis and its annual audited
financial statements at the close of its fiscal year. Under the IBC Act, PIB
may not deal with &#147;domestic persons&#148; as such term is defined in the IBC Act.
Also, it may only engage in those activities authorized in the IBC Act, the
regulations adopted thereunder and its license.

 <P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IBC Act empowers the Office of the Commissioner to revoke or suspend,
after a hearing, the license of an international banking entity
(&#147;IBE&#148;) if, among other
things, it fails to comply with the IBC Act, regulations issued by the Office
of the Commissioner or the terms of its license or if the Office of the
Commissioner finds that the business of the IBE is
conducted in a manner not consistent with the public interest.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In January 2004, the
Government of Puerto Rico approved a legislation that partially
eliminates the tax exempt status of IBE that operates as a division
or branch of a bank in Puerto Rico. In order to be subject to tax,
the IBE&#146;s net taxable income must exceed 40% in 2004, 30% in
2005, and 20% in 2006 and thereafter, of the net taxable income of
the bank as a whole. Once these thresholds are exceeded, the IBE will
be taxed at regular tax rates on its net taxable income that exceeds
the applicable threshold. Currently, management of the Corporation
does not expect any financial impact from this new legislation since
the net taxable income of BPPR&#146;s IBE has not exceeded and is not
expected to exceed 20% of BPPR&#146;s net taxable income.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;16, 2004, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto
Rico approved a request filed by the U.S. Department of Justice to dismiss the
one-count information filed against Banco Popular on January&nbsp;16, 2003, and
proceeded to dismiss it, effective immediately. The United States noted that
the period of twelve months had expired and Banco Popular was in full
compliance with all of its obligations under the Deferred Prosecution
Agreement. The course of action taken by the Court follows the terms of a
Deferred Prosecution Agreement among Banco Popular, the U.S. Department of
Justice, the Federal Reserve System, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network of the U.S. Department of Treasury (FinCEN), approved on January&nbsp;16,
2003. The Agreement stipulated the U.S. Department of Justice would request the
dismissal of one-count information within 30&nbsp;days after the 12-month period
following the settlement, provided Banco Popular complied with its obligations
under the Agreement over the course of one year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;16, 2003, the United States District Court for the District of
Puerto Rico dismissed a derivative action that was filed by a shareholder of
Popular, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto
Rico in connection with the Deferred Prosecution Agreement described above
against certain current and former directors of Popular, Inc. alleging that the
defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to take the necessary
steps to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and to implement sufficient controls
to permit them to exercise their oversight responsibilities and ensure
compliance with Federal and state laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation and its subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits
arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes, based on the
opinion of legal counsel, that the aggregate liabilities, if any, arising from
such actions would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position
and results of operations of the Corporation.
