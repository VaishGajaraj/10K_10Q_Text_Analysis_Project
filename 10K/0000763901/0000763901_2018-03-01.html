<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria (the &#147;hurricanes&#148;) impacted Puerto Rico, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands,
causing extensive damage and disrupting the markets in which BPPR does business. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Puerto Rico and the USVI were declared disaster zones by
President Trump due to the impact of the hurricanes, thus making them eligible for Federal assistance. Notwithstanding the significant recovery operation that is underway by the Federal, state and local governments, as of the date of this report, a
number of businesses and homes in Puerto Rico and the USVI remain without power, and some businesses are partially operating or remain closed, while others have permanently closed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The damages caused by the hurricanes are substantial and have had a material adverse impact on economic activity in Puerto Rico. It is still,
however, too early to fully assess and quantify the extent of the damages caused by the hurricanes, as well as their long-term impact on economic activity. Employment levels have also decreased in the short-term and could continue to decline as a
result of impact of the hurricanes on economic activity and outmigration trends. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Decline as a result of the impact of the hurricane on economic

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-tax</FONT> hurricane-related expenses, including an incremental provision for loan losses of $67.7&nbsp;million, which includes $5.8&nbsp;million for the covered loan portfolio (described below). These amounts are net
of amounts receivable for related insurance claims of $1.1&nbsp;million related to physical damages to the Corporation&#146;s premises, equipment and other real estate owned (&#147;OREO&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the incremental provision and direct operating expenses, results for year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 were impacted by the
hurricanes in the form of a reduction in revenue resulting from reduced merchant transaction activity, the waiver of certain late fees and service charges, including ATM transaction fees, to businesses and consumers in hurricane-affected areas, as
well as the economic and operational disruption in the Corporation&#146;s mortgage origination, servicing and loss mitigation activities due to the hurricanes&#146; operational and economic impact. These resulted in a decrease in revenue of
approximately $31&nbsp;million when compared to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-hurricane</FONT> levels. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While significant progress

purchases or other projects, and (ii)&nbsp;commercial real estate (CRE) loans (excluding construction loans) for income-producing real estate properties as well as owner-occupied properties. C&amp;I loans are underwritten individually and usually
secured with the assets of the company and the personal guarantee of the business owners. CRE loans consist of loans for income-producing real estate properties and the financing of owner-occupied facilities if there is real estate as collateral. We
mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow sustainability that exceeds debt service requirements. Non-owner-occupied CRE loans are generally made to finance
office and industrial buildings, healthcare facilities, multifamily buildings and retail shopping centers and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale or refinancing of the property. </TD></TR></TABLE>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On April&nbsp;30, 2010, BPPR acquired most of the loan portfolio of the former Westernbank Puerto Rico from the FDIC, as receiver (the
&#147;Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction&#148;). Loans acquired in the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction that are subject to a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC are referred to as &#147;covered loans.&#148; &#147;Covered&#148; foreclosed
other real estate properties are also subject to loss sharing agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the loss sharing agreements, the FDIC&#146;s obligation to reimburse BPPR for losses with respect to assets covered by such agreements (the
&#147;covered assets&#148;) begins with the first dollar of loss incurred. On a combined basis, the FDIC will reimburse BPPR for 80% of all qualifying losses with respect to the covered assets during the covered period. BPPR will reimburse the FDIC
for 80% of qualifying recoveries with respect to losses for which the FDIC reimbursed BPPR. The FDIC loss sharing period under the loss sharing agreement for commercial (including construction) and consumer loans ended on June&nbsp;30, 2015, with
additional recovery sharing for three years thereafter. The loss sharing agreement for single-family residential mortgage loans provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for ten years (ending on the quarter ending
June&nbsp;30, 2020). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC, the risks of the covered loans are significantly different from
other loans in our portfolio, and thus we have determined to segregate them in our financial statements and in the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Covered loans are reported in loans
exclusive of the estimated FDIC loss share indemnification asset. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At December 31, 2017, covered loans totaled $ 517&nbsp;million or 1% of
total consolidated assets of Popular. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, BPPR agreed to make a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">true-up</FONT> payment to the FDIC following the expiration of the loss-share period or upon the final disposition of all covered assets if losses on the loss sharing agreements fail to reach expected levels. At
December&nbsp;31, 2017, the carrying amount of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">true-up</FONT> payment obligation amounted to $165&nbsp;million. For a discussion of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">true-up</FONT> payment obligation, please
refer to Note 11 to the accompanying financial statements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Business Concentration </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since our business activities are currently concentrated primarily in Puerto Rico, our results of operations and financial condition are
dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. The concentration of our operations in Puerto Rico exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a
wider geographic base. Our asset and revenue composition by geographical area is presented in &#147;Financial Information about Geographic Areas&#148; below and in Note 41, &#147;Segment Reporting&#148;, to the consolidated financial statements
included in the Annual Report. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our loan portfolio is diversified by loan category. However, approximately 66% of our non-covered loan portfolio at
December 31, 2017 consisted of real estate-related loans, including residential mortgage loans, construction loans and commercial loans secured by commercial real estate. The table below presents the distribution of our non-covered loan portfolio by
loan category at December 31, 2017. &#147;Legacy&#148; refers to loans remaining from lines of businesses we exited as a result of the restructuring of our U.S. operations in 2008 and 2009. </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2017, our credit exposure was centered in our $ 24.3&nbsp;billion <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-covered</FONT> loan portfolio which represented 60% of our earning assets excluding covered loans. Credit risk is controlled and
monitored through active asset quality management, including the use of lending standards, thorough review of potential borrowers and active asset quality administration. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Business activities that expose us to credit risk are managed within the Board of Director&#146;s Risk Management policy, and the Credit Risk
Tolerance Limits policy which establishes limits that consider factors such as maintaining a prudent balance of risk-taking across diversified risk types and business units, compliance with regulatory guidance, controlling the exposure to lower
credit quality assets, and limiting growth in, and overall exposure to, any product or risk segment where we do not have sufficient experience and a proven ability to predict credit losses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our Credit Strategy Committee (&#147;CRESCO&#148;) is management&#146;s top policy-making body with respect to credit-related matters and
credit strategies. CRESCO reviews the activities of each subsidiary to ensure a proactive and coordinated management of credit granting, credit exposures and credit procedures. CRESCO&#146;s principal functions include reviewing the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses and periodically approving appropriate provisions, monitoring compliance with charge-off policy, establishing portfolio diversification, yield and quality standards, establishing credit exposure reporting standards,
monitoring asset quality, and approving credit policies and amendments thereto for the subsidiaries and/or business lines, including special lending approval authorities when and if appropriate. The analysis of the allowance adequacy is presented to
the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors for review, consideration and ratification on a quarterly basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also have a

business units, evaluating the credit risk rating system and reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;) and regulatory standards. The CCRMD also ensures that
the subsidiaries comply with the credit policies and applicable regulations, and monitors credit underwriting standards. Also, the CCRMD performs ongoing monitoring of the portfolio, including potential areas of concern for specific borrowers and/or

MRM&#147;) Division. Through the Commercial Loan Review Unit at the Corporate Loan Review Department (&#147;CLRD&#148;), CLR&nbsp;&amp; MRM evaluates compliance with the Bank&#146;s Commercial Credit Norms and Procedures and the precision of risk
rating accuracy. The CLRD performs annual credit process reviews of several commercial portfolios, including small and middle market, construction, asset-based and corporate banking lending groups in BPPR, as well as BPNA&#146;s commercial and
construction portfolios.&nbsp;This group evaluates the credit risk profile of each originating unit along with each unit&#146;s credit administration effectiveness, including the assessment of the risk rating representative of the current credit
quality of the loans, and the evaluation of credit and collateral documentation. The monitoring performed by CLRD contributes to assess compliance with credit policies and underwriting standards, to determine the current level of credit risk, to
evaluate the effectiveness of the credit management process and to identify control deficiencies that may arise in the credit-origination and management processes. Based on its findings, CLRD develops recommendations to implement corrective actions,
if necessary, that help in maintaining a sound credit process and that credit risk is kept at an acceptable level. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We maintain
comprehensive credit policies for all lines of business in order to mitigate credit risk. Our credit policies are ratified by our Board of Directors and set forth, among other things, underwriting standards and procedures for monitoring and
evaluating loan portfolio quality. Our credit policies also require prompt identification and quantification of asset quality deterioration or potential loss in order to ensure the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Included in these
policies, primarily determined by the amount, type of loan and risk characteristics of the credit facility, are various approval levels and lending limit constraints, ranging from the branch or department level to those that are more centralized.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our credit policies and procedures establish strict documentation requirements for each loan and related collateral type, when
applicable, during the underwriting, closing and monitoring phases. During the initial loan underwriting process, the credit policies require, at a minimum, historical financial statements or tax returns of the borrower and any guarantor, an
analysis of financial information contained in a credit approval package, a risk rating determination in the case of commercial and construction loans, reports from credit agencies and appraisals for real estate-related loans. The credit policies
also set forth the required closing documentation depending on the loan and the collateral type. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Although we originate most of our loans
internally in both the Puerto Rico and mainland United States markets, we occasionally purchase or participate in loans originated by other financial institutions. When we purchase or participate in loans originated by others, we conduct the same
underwriting analysis of the borrowers and apply the same criteria as we do for loans originated by us. This also includes a review of the applicable legal documentation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Set forth below are the general parameters under which we analyze our major loan categories: </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Commercial and Construction</U>: Commercial and construction loans are underwritten using a comprehensive analysis of the borrower&#146;s
operations, including the borrower&#146;s business model, management, financial statements, pro-forma financial condition including financial projections, use of funds, debt service capacity, leverage and the financial strength of any guarantor.
Most of our commercial and construction loans are secured by real estate and other collateral. A review of the quality and value of collateral, including independent third-party appraisals of machinery and equipment and commercial real estate, as
appropriate, is also conducted. Physical inspection of the collateral and audits of receivables is conducted when appropriate. Our credit policies provide maximum loan-to-value ratios that limit the size of a loan to a maximum percentage of the
value of the real estate collateral securing the loan. The loan-to-value percentage varies by the type of collateral. Our loan-to value limitations are, in certain cases, determined by other risk factors such as the financial strength of the
borrower or guarantor, the equity provided to the project and the viability of the project itself. Most CRE loans are originated with full recourse or limited recourse to all principals and owners. Non-recourse lending is limited to borrowers with
very solid financial capacity. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, $ 4.5&nbsp;billion, or 61%, of our commercial and construction loans in
Puerto Rico were secured by real estate, while in the mainland United States these figures totaled $ 4.0&nbsp;billion, or 80%, respectively. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Consumer, Mortgage and Lease Financings:</U> Our consumer, mortgage and lease financings are
originated consistent with the underwriting approach described above, but also include an assessment of each borrower&#146;s personal financial condition, including verification of income, assets and Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit score.
Credit reports are obtained and reconciled with the financial statements provided to us. Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans does not exist, for risk assessment purposes, subprime consumer and mortgage loans in the BPPR
segment are determined based on the final rule definition of higher risk consumer loans issued by the FDIC which was made effective during 2013. A higher-risk consumer loan is defined as a loan where, as of origination, or as of refinance, the
probability of default (PD) within two years is greater than 20%. In Puerto Rico, as of December&nbsp;31, 2017, consumer and mortgage loans with subprime characteristics consisted of $119.8&nbsp;million (4% of the Puerto Rico consumer loan
portfolio) and $645.1&nbsp;million (10% of the Puerto Rico mortgage loan portfolio), respectively. Since the final rule definition is not applicable to our U.S. operation, subprime loans in the BPNA segment are defined as borrowers with one or a
combination of certain credit risk factors, such as FICO credit scores (generally less than 620 for secured products and 660 for unsecured products), high debt to income ratios (higher than 50%) and inferior payment history, including factors such
as defaults and limited credit history. As of December 31, 2017, our mainland United States consumer and mortgage loans with subprime characteristics consisted of $54.6&nbsp;million (or 11% of the U.S. mainland consumer loan portfolio) and
$195.3&nbsp;million (or 28% of U.S. mainland mortgage loans portfolio). As part of the restructuring in 2008 of our U.S. mainland operations, we discontinued originating loans with subprime characteristics in those operations, including the U.S.
non-conventional mortgage loan portfolio and E-LOAN, Inc. Popular does not target subprime borrowers and does not offer products specifically designed for subprime borrowers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, there was a nominal amount of interest-only loans in our consumer loans portfolio and $76.0&nbsp;million of
interest-only loans in our mortgage loan portfolio, all of which were at BPPR. Also, we did not have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgage loans in our Puerto Rico portfolio, except for a special step loan mortgage product to purchasers
of units within construction projects financed by BPPR. This product, with a term of up to 40 years, provides for 100% financing at a 2.99% interest rate for the first five years of the term of the loan and 5.88% fixed-rate for the remaining term.
Consistent with our credit policies, the underwriting and loan approval process for our step loan mortgage product is based on a number of factors, including an assessment of each borrower&#146;s personal financial condition (including verification
of income, assets and FICO credit score), as well as debt-to-equity ratio, reserves, loan-to-value and prior mortgage experience. While Popular has not established specific limits for FICO credit scores, debt-to-income ratios and loan-to-values
applicable to this product, the underwriting parameters applied to this product are generally similar to the standards used for the underwriting of our non-conforming loans, except for higher loan-to-value ratios (90% or higher). As of
December&nbsp;31, 2017, Popular had $330.5&nbsp;million of these step loans. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December 31, 2017, $6.6&nbsp;billion, or 66%, of our
total consumer loans, including mortgage loans, in Puerto Rico were secured by real estate. In the United States mainland, these figures totaled $ 0.9&nbsp;billion, or 75%, respectively. Lease financings are also secured by the underlying asset.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Loan extensions, renewals and restructurings </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Loans with satisfactory credit profiles can be extended, renewed or restructured. Many commercial loan facilities are structured as lines of
credit, which are mainly one year in term and therefore are required to be renewed annually. Other facilities may be restructured or extended from time to time based upon changes in the borrower&#146;s business needs, use of funds, timing of
completion of projects and other factors. If the borrower is not deemed to have financial difficulties, extensions, renewals and restructurings are done in the normal course of business and are not considered concessions, and the loans continue to
be recorded as performing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We evaluate various factors in order to determine if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties.
Indicators that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties include, for example: (i)&nbsp;the borrower is currently in default on any of its debt or it is probable that the borrower would be in payment default on any of its debt in the
foreseeable future without the modification; (ii)&nbsp;the borrower has declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy; (iii)&nbsp;there is significant doubt as to whether the borrower will continue to be a going concern; (iv)&nbsp;currently,
the borrower has securities that have been delisted, are in the process of being delisted, or are under threat of being delisted from an exchange; and (v)&nbsp;based on estimates and projections that only encompass the current business capabilities,
the borrower forecasts that its entity-specific cash flows will be insufficient to service the debt (both interest and principal) in accordance with the contractual terms of the existing agreement through maturity; and absent the current
modification, the borrower cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at an effective interest rate equal to the current market interest rate for similar debt for a non-troubled debtor. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have specialized workout officers who handle substantially all commercial loans that are past
due 90 days and over, borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, and those that are considered problem loans based on their risk profile. As a general policy, we do not advance additional money to borrowers that are 90 days past due or over. In
commercial and construction loans, certain exceptions may be approved under certain circumstances, including (i)&nbsp;when past due status is administrative in nature, such as expiration of a loan facility before the new documentation is executed,
and not as a result of payment or credit issues; (ii)&nbsp;to improve our collateral position or otherwise maximize recovery or mitigate potential future losses; and (iii)&nbsp;with respect to certain entities that, although related through common
ownership, are not cross defaulted nor cross-collateralized and are performing satisfactorily under their respective loan facilities. Such advances are underwritten following our credit policy guidelines and approved up to prescribed policy limits,
which are dependent on the borrower&#146;s financial condition, collateral and guarantee, among others. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the legal lending
limit established under applicable state banking law, discussed in detail below, business activities that expose the Corporation to credit risk should be managed within guidelines described in the Credit Risk Tolerance Limits policy. Limits are
defined for loss and credit performance metrics, portfolio composition and concentration, and industry and name-level, which monitors lending concentration to a single borrower or a group of related borrowers, including specific lending limits based
on industry or other criteria, such as a percentage of the banks&#146; capital. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Loans to borrowers with financial difficulties can be
modified as a loss mitigation alternative. New terms and conditions of these loans are individually evaluated to determine a feasible loan restructuring. In many consumer and mortgage loans, a trial period is established where the borrower has to
comply with three consecutive monthly payments under the new terms before implementing the new structure. Loans that are restructured, renewed or extended due to financial difficulties and the terms reflect concessions that would not otherwise be
granted are considered as Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#147;TDRs&#148;). These concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize
collection. These concessions stem from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or are imposed by law or a court. TDRs also include loans for which the Corporation has entered into liquidation proceedings with borrowers in which neither
principal or interest is forgiven, but the Corporation accepts payments which are different than the contractual payment schedule. Refer to additional information on TDRs on Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Annual
Report for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Loans classified as TDRs are reported in non-accrual status if the loan was in
non-accruing status at the time of the modification. The TDR loan will continue in non-accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated a willingness and ability to make the restructured loan payments (at least six months of sustained performance
after classified as TDR and management has concluded whether it is probable that the borrower would not be in payment default in a foreseeable future). If the loan was appropriately on accrual status prior to the restructuring, the borrower has
demonstrated performance under the previous terms (for a period of at least six months, as defined), and the bank&#146;s credit evaluation shows the borrower&#146;s capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms (both principal and
interest payments), it is likely that the appropriate conclusion is for the loan to remain on accrual at the time of the restructuring. Loans classified as TDRs are excluded from TDR status if performance under the restructured terms exists for a
reasonable period (at least twelve months of sustained performance after being classified) and the loan yields a market rate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Competition </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The financial services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. In Puerto Rico, our primary market, the banking business is highly
competitive with respect to originating loans, acquiring deposits and providing other banking services. Most of our direct competition for our products and services comes from commercial banks. The principal competitors for BPPR include locally
based commercial banks and a few large U.S. and foreign banks with operations in Puerto Rico. On February&nbsp;27, 2015, BPPR entered into an FDIC assisted-transaction in which, in an alliance with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-bidders,</FONT>
including BPNA, it acquired certain assets and all deposits, except for certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-brokered</FONT> deposits, under receivership of Doral Bank. While the number of banking competitors in Puerto Rico has been reduced
in recent years as a result of consolidations, these transactions have allowed some of our competitors to gain greater resources, such as a broader range of products and services. As of December 31, 2017, there were 8 commercial banks operating in
Puerto Rico. </P>
 <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">13 </P>

<h5 align="left"><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also compete with specialized players in the local financial industry that are not subject to
the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those competitors include brokerage firms, mortgage companies, insurance companies, automobile and equipment finance companies, local and federal credit unions (locally
known as &#147;cooperativas&#148;), credit card companies, consumer finance companies, institutional lenders and other financial and non-financial institutions and entities. Credit unions generally provide basic consumer financial services. These
competitors collectively represent a significant portion of the market and have lower cost structure and fewer regulatory constraints. As previously mentioned, on February&nbsp;14, 2018, BPPR entered into an agreement to acquire $1.8&nbsp;billion in
retail auto and commercial loans from Reliable Financial Services, Inc., Wells Fargo&#146;s auto finance business in P.R. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the United
States we continue to face substantial competitive pressure as our footprint resides in two large, metropolitan markets of New York City / Northern New Jersey and the greater Miami area.&nbsp;There is a large number of Community and Regional banks
along with national banking institutions present in both markets, many of which have a larger amount of resources than us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In both Puerto
Rico and the United States, the primary factors in competing for business include pricing, convenience of branch locations and other delivery methods, range of products offered, and the level of service delivered. We must compete effectively along
all these parameters to be successful. We may experience pricing pressure as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. Competition is particularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is very aggressive.
Increased competition could require that we increase the rates offered on deposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Economic factors, along with legislative and technological changes, will have an ongoing impact on the competitive environment within the financial services
industry. We work to anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions whether it may be developing and marketing innovative products and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our products and services,
cross-marketing, or providing personalized banking services. We strive to distinguish ourselves from other community banks and financial services providers in our marketplace by providing a high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to
attract and retain business. However, we can provide no assurance as to the effectiveness of these efforts on our future business or results of operations, as to our continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, and to
sufficiently improve our services and/or banking products, in order to successfully compete in our primary service areas. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Employees </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At December&nbsp;31, 2017, we employed 7,784 full time equivalent employees, of which 7,101 were located in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands
and 683 in the U.S. mainland. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining group. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Financial Information About Segments </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our corporate structure consists of two reportable segments &#151; BPPR and BPNA. A &#147;Corporate&#148; group has been defined to support the
reportable segments. Revenue from the 16.10% ownership interest in EVERTEC is reported as non-interest income in the Corporate group. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Management determined the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate

</I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDIA&#148;) requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take prompt
corrective action in respect of insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital tiers: &#147;well capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148;
&#147;significantly undercapitalized,&#148; and &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148;. A depository institution&#146;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An insured depository institution will be deemed to be (i) &#147;well capitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital
ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority
to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not &#147;well capitalized&#148;; (iii) &#147;undercapitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital
ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1
capital ratio less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; if the institution&#146;s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average
quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory
examination rating with respect to certain matters. An insured depository institution&#146;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an
accurate representation of the institution&#146;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDIC generally
prohibits an insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.
Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration
plans. A depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the capital restoration plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the
capital deficiency, when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to
succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell
sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver
or conservator. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA apply to the FDIC-insured depository institutions such

any of our other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-banking</FONT> subsidiaries, on the other, and that impose collateralization requirements on such credit extensions. A bank may not engage in any covered transaction if the aggregate amount of

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Dodd-Frank Act requires bank holding companies, such as Popular and PNA, to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their
subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. Popular and PNA are expected to commit resources to support their subsidiary banks, including at times when Popular and PNA may not be in a financial position to provide such
resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository institutions are subordinated in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository institution. In the event of a
bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of
payment. BPPR and BPNA are currently the only insured depository institution subsidiaries of Popular and PNA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Resolution Planning </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50&nbsp;billion or more are required to report periodically to the FDIC and the Federal
Reserve Board such company&#146;s plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. In addition, insured depository institutions with total assets of $50&nbsp;billion or more are required to submit to
the FDIC periodic contingency plans for resolution in the event of the institution&#146;s failure. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, Popular,
PNA, BPPR and BPNA&#146;s total assets were below the thresholds for applicability of these rules. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Dividend Restrictions </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The principal sources of funding for Popular and PNA have included dividends received from their banking and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-banking</FONT> subsidiaries, asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity. Various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding
company without regulatory approval. A member bank must obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income
for that year, combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an
amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be
withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board. Pursuant to these requirements, BPNA may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board or the NYSDFS. BPNA paid a dividend of
$10.4&nbsp;million during the year ended December 2017 after receiving the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, BPPR declared cash dividends of $192&nbsp;million, a portion of
which was used by Popular for the payments of the cash dividends on its outstanding common stock and a $75&nbsp;million accelerated stock repurchase. Subject to the Federal Reserve&#146;s ability to establish more stringent specific requirements
under its supervisory or enforcement authority, at December&nbsp;31, 2017, BPPR could have declared a dividend of approximately $341&nbsp;million. It is Federal Reserve Board policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on
common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#146;s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality
and overall financial condition. Moreover, under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company should not maintain dividend levels that place undue pressure on the capital of depository institution subsidiaries or that may undermine the bank
holding company&#146;s ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. For further information please refer to Part II, Item 5, &#147;Market for Registrant&#146;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Subject to compliance with certain conditions, distributions of U.S. sourced dividends to a corporation
organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are subject to a withholding tax of 10% instead of the 30% applied to other &#147;foreign&#148; corporations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">See &#147;Puerto Rico Regulation&#148; below for a description of certain restrictions on BPPR&#146;s ability to pay dividends under Puerto

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Substantially all the deposits of BPPR and BPNA are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) of the
FDIC, and BPPR and BPNA are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution minus the average tangible equity
of the institution during the assessment period. For larger depository institutions with over $10&nbsp;billion in assets, such as BPPR, the FDIC uses a &#147;scorecard&#148; methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual
large institution will fail and the </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
magnitude of the impact on the deposit insurance fund if such a failure occurs. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors
that are not adequately captured in the calculations. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate for depositary institutions with $10&nbsp;billion or more in assets, including BPPR, ranges from 3 to 30
basis points on an annualized basis. After the effect of potential base-rate adjustments, the total base assessment rate could range from 1.5 to 40 basis points on an annualized basis. As of July&nbsp;1, 2016, the FDIC imposes a surcharge on the
assessments of depository institutions with $10&nbsp;billion or more in assets, including BPPR, through the earlier of the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35% and December&nbsp;31, 2018. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 separated the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;) assessment to service the interest on its bond
obligations from the DIF assessment. The amount assessed on individual institutions by the FICO is in addition to the amount paid for deposit insurance according to the FDIC&#146;s risk-related assessment rate schedules. The FICO assessment rate for
the first quarter of 2018 was 0.460 basis points of the assessment base. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had a DIF average total asset
less average tangible equity assessment base of approximately $38&nbsp;billion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Brokered Deposits </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDIA and regulations adopted thereunder restrict the use of brokered deposits and the rate of interest payable on deposits for institutions
that are less than well capitalized. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized. Popular does not believe the brokered deposits regulation has had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of BPPR and BPNA.

one or more bank branches in a state of the United States or in a foreign country, where such branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state or country, the Office of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the
reserve requirements of Section&nbsp;16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated November&nbsp;24, 1982, BPPR has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto

the legal lending limit for BPPR under this provision was approximately $277&nbsp;million. In the case of loans which are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the maximum aggregate amount is increased to one
third of the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">paid-in</FONT> capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the institution is well capitalized and had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the Office of the Commissioner or any
regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15% of 50% of its undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall also include 33 1/3% of 50% of
its undivided profits. Institutions rated 2 in their last regulatory examination may include this additional component in their legal lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner. There are no restrictions
under Section&nbsp;17 on the amount of loans that are wholly secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of the United States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of municipalities or

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Popular, like other financial institutions, faces a number of risks inherent to our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of
operations and capital position. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that we
currently deem to be immaterial, or that are generally applicable to all financial institutions, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital position. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Recent hurricanes caused extensive damage in Puerto Rico, our primary market, and in other markets in which we operate, which could have a material adverse
effect on such jurisdictions&#146; economies and could materially adversely affect us. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the month of September 2017, Hurricanes
Irma and Maria, two major hurricanes, caused extensive destruction in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands (&#147;USVI&#148;) and the British Virgin Islands (&#147;BVI&#148;), disrupting the primary markets in which BPPR does business. Most
relevant, Hurricane Maria made landfall on September&nbsp;20, 2017, causing severe wind and flood damage to infrastructure, homes and businesses throughout Puerto Rico. Following the passage of Hurricane Maria, all Puerto Rico was left without
electrical power, other basic utility and infrastructure services (such as water, communications, ports and other transportation networks) were severely curtailed and the government imposed a mandatory curfew. The hurricanes caused a significant
disruption to the island&#146;s economic activity. Most business establishments, including retailers and wholesalers, financial institutions, manufacturing facilities and hotels, were temporarily closed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Puerto Rico and the USVI were declared disaster zones by President Trump due to the impact of the hurricanes, thus making them eligible for
Federal assistance. Notwithstanding the significant recovery operation that has been carried out by Federal, state and local governments during the past five months, and that is still underway, as of the date of this report, approximately 13% of the
clients of the government&#146;s electric utility in Puerto Rico remain without power (according to the government&#146;s estimates), and a number businesses are partially operating or remain closed, while others have permanently closed. Electronic
transactions, a significant source of revenue for the bank, declined significantly following the hurricanes as a result of the lack of power and telecommunication services, but have already returned to
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-hurricane</FONT> levels. Several reports indicate that the hurricanes have also accelerated the outmigration trends that Puerto Rico was experiencing, with many residents moving to the mainland United States,
either on a temporary or permanent basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The damage caused by the hurricanes is substantial and has had a material adverse impact on
economic activity in Puerto Rico. The Commonwealth government&#146;s proposed fiscal plan under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (&#147;PROMESA&#148;) estimates an 11% decrease in real GNP in fiscal year 2018 (July
2017-June 2018), as well as a steep decrease in the government&#146;s tax revenues. It is still, however, too early to fully assess and quantify the extent of the damage caused by the hurricanes, as well as their long-term impact on economic
activity. Furthermore, the hurricanes severely damaged or destroyed buildings, homes and other structures, impacting the value of such properties, some of which may serve as collateral to our loans. While our collateral is generally insured, the
value of such insured structures, as well as other structures unaffected by the hurricanes, may be significantly impacted, and the cost of such insurance could increase. Although some of the impact of the hurricanes, including its short-term impact
on economic activity, may be offset by recovery and reconstruction activity and the influx of Federal emergency funds and private insurance proceeds, it is too early to know the total amount of Federal and private insurance money to be received and
whether such transfers will significantly offset the negative economic, fiscal and demographic impact of the hurricanes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our credit
exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which accounted as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 for approximately 80% of our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">year-to-date</FONT></FONT> revenues, 76% of our total assets and 78%
of our deposits. As such, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the general trends of the Puerto Rico economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets and asset values in Puerto Rico. The
deterioration in economic activity and potential impact on asset values resulting from the hurricanes, when added to Puerto Rico&#146;s ongoing fiscal crisis and recession, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,
liquidity, results of operations and capital position in a manner greater than estimated by management and reflected in our financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017. To a lesser extent, we are also exposed to other areas that
were similarly affected by the hurricanes, such as the US and British Virgin Islands, where as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 we had 2% of our total assets, 4% of our deposits and accounted for approximately 3% of our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>A significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, where a prolonged economic recession and
a current fiscal crisis has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A significant portion of our financial
activities and credit exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which, even before the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017, was experiencing a severe economic and fiscal crisis resulting from continuing economic contraction,
persistent and significant budget deficits, a high debt burden, unfunded legacy pension obligations and lack of access to the capital markets, among other factors. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Puerto Rico entered recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (GNP) thereafter contracted in real
terms every year between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2016 (inclusive), except for growth of 0.5% in fiscal year 2012 (likely as a result of the large amount of governmental stimulus and deficit spending in that fiscal year). GNP is projected to
have further contracted in fiscal year 2017 and is expected to continue to contract in fiscal year 2018, exacerbated by the impact of the hurricanes. The Commonwealth&#146;s structural imbalance between revenues and expenditures, on the one hand,
and unfunded legacy pension obligations, on the other hand, coupled with the Commonwealth&#146;s inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders, have resulted in the Commonwealth and various public corporations
defaulting on their public debt and entering into bankruptcy proceedings under PROMESA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In response to this crisis, in June 2016, the
U.S. Federal Government enacted PROMESA, which, among other things, established a seven-member Federally-appointed oversight board (the &#147;Oversight Board&#148;) with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities
and provides to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad-based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy-type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PROMESA also requires the certification by the Oversight Board of fiscal plans for the Commonwealth and certain instrumentalities. The fiscal
plan certified by the Oversight Board for the Commonwealth on March 2017 projected that, even after the implementation of a number of fiscal measures, the Commonwealth government would not have sufficient revenues to cover its debt service
obligations in full while continuing to provide essential government services, thus recognizing the need for significant debt restructuring and/or write-downs. At the request of the Oversight Board, however, the Commonwealth government submitted a
revised fiscal plan in February 2018. The revised fiscal plan takes into account, among other things, the adverse impact of the hurricanes and the expected positive impact of increased federal support and significant reconstruction spending, and
projects a significant economic contraction of 11% in fiscal year 2018 followed by a period of economic growth in the next five fiscal years. Although the revised fiscal plan projects a cash flow surplus (excluding the payment of any debt service)
over the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">six-year</FONT> period, the fiscal plan reaffirms the need for significant debt restructurings and/or write-downs. The Oversight Board expects to certify a revised fiscal plan for the Commonwealth by
March&nbsp;30, 2018. For additional information regarding the fiscal plans, refer to &#147;Geographic and government risk&#148; in the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Annual
Report. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The credit quality of BPPR&#146;s loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in
Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The effects of the prolonged recession are reflected in limited loan demand, an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in
Puerto Rico. The measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the near future could affect many of our individual customers and customers&#146; businesses, which could cause credit losses that adversely affect
us. The size of the financing gap indicated by the Commonwealth&#146;s fiscal projections suggest that the level of fiscal adjustment of any fiscal plan approved by the Oversight Board, and its resulting impact on the local economy, will be
significant. The fiscal adjustment may also result in significant resistance from local politicians and other stakeholders, which may lead to social and political instability. The Puerto Rico economy could also be adversely impacted as a result of
the enactment by the U.S. Congress of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which imposes a 12.5% tax on income generated from patents and licenses held by companies outside of the United States, including those operating in Puerto Rico. That new tax
could affect Puerto Rico&#146;s ability to attract or retain foreign corporations engaged in manufacturing, a dominant sector in the Puerto Rico economy. Considering these factors, coupled with the impact of the hurricanes, the Commonwealth&#146;s
proposed fiscal plan estimates an 11% contraction in real GNP for fiscal year 2018. The aforementioned conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence, which would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these conditions and cause decreased
borrowings, either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for customer loans. Any reduction in consumer spending because of these issues may also adversely impact our interest and
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-interest</FONT> revenues. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If global or local economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico is unable to
manage its fiscal crisis, including consummating an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, those adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict and that are
outside of our control. While PROMESA provides the Commonwealth with tools to restructure the debt obligations of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities in an orderly manner, these tools are new and untested. Furthermore, the size of the fiscal
gaps suggested by the Commonwealth&#146;s projections indicates the possibility of significant creditor losses. Both of these factors have made the PROMESA debt restructuring process highly adversarial and protracted. Under such circumstances, we
could experience an increase in the level of provision for loan losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 41 to the consolidated
financial statements. For additional information regarding the Puerto Rico economy, the current fiscal crisis and the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, refer to &#147;Geographic and government risk&#148; in the Management&#146;s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Annual Report. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Further deterioration in collateral values of properties
securing our construction, commercial and mortgage loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results of operations. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The value of properties in some of the markets we serve, in particular in Puerto Rico, has declined in recent years as a result of adverse
economic conditions. Further deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our construction, commercial and mortgage loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December&nbsp;31, 2017, approximately 4%, 31% and 30%
of our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-covered</FONT> loan portfolio consisted of construction loans, commercial loans secured by real estate and mortgage loans, respectively. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Substantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is in Puerto Rico, the
USVI, the BVI or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. Recent economic reports related
to the real estate market in Puerto Rico indicate that several sectors of the real estate market are subject to further reductions in value related to general economic conditions. In particular, the value of real estate collateral located in Puerto
Rico may be further affected by the recent impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria and also by actions taken by the Commonwealth or the Oversight Board to address Puerto Rico&#146;s fiscal and economic crisis. Not only are such actions likely to have
negative economic effects in the short run, but also certain measures recommended by the Oversight Board for inclusion in the fiscal plan, such as reforming the local property tax regime, could have a direct impact on the value of local real estate.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We measure loan impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, which is derived from
estimated collateral values, principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration prices in observed transactions involving similar assets in similar locations, size and supply and demand. An appraisal report is only an estimate
of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the
property. In addition, given the current slowdown in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">During the year ended December 31, 2017, net charge-offs specifically related to values of properties securing our non-covered commercial,
construction and mortgage loan portfolios totaled $28.6&nbsp;million, none and $12.7&nbsp;million, respectively. Continued deterioration of the fair value of real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired loans would require increases in
our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the credit quality of our construction, commercial and
mortgage portfolio, see the Credit Risk section of the Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Annual Report. </P>

widespread reduction of business activity in general. The resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial markets adversely affected our industry and our business,
results of operations and financial condition. A <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-occurrence</FONT> of these or other difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing us and others in the financial industry. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Popular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal, New York and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in
applicable federal, New York or Puerto Rico laws or regulations could have a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers, authority and
operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or
remedy unsafe and unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on Popular. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Commonwealth has enacted various reforms in response to its fiscal problems and is likely to implement additional reforms as
part of its fiscal plan under PROMESA. In particular, the Commonwealth&#146;s fiscal plan contemplates a comprehensive tax reform that could include a reduction in the statutory corporate tax rates. While such a reduction could decrease our
effective tax rate prospectively, it would result in a significant decrease to our Puerto Rico deferred tax asset, with a corresponding <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-cash</FONT> increase to income tax expense, and a decrease to capital in the
year of enactment. Other legislative changes, particularly other changes in tax laws and the enactment of laws affecting creditor&#146;s rights, including to provide relief to persons and businesses affected by the recent hurricanes, could adversely
impact our results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We are subject to default risk in our loan portfolio. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans we originate or acquire. We establish
provisions for loan losses, which lead to reductions in the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio
in accordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic and market
conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay the loans. For example, we recorded an incremental provision for loan losses of $67.6&nbsp;million in 2017 representing management&#146;s estimate, based on currently available
information, of the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria on the loan portfolios. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to increase the provision for loan
losses in the future as a result of future increases in <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-performing</FONT> loans or for other reasons beyond our control. As discussed below, the temporary payment moratorium we instituted in response to the
recent hurricanes has further limited our visibility regarding the impact of these events on the credit quality of our portfolio. Any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any loan losses in excess of our provisions for loan losses
would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and result of operations. We will continue to evaluate our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and may be required to increase such amounts. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Recent hurricanes caused significant disruptions to BPPR&#146;s operations and resulted in the implementation by BPPR of various measures to address

moratorium program.&nbsp;Under our servicing agreements, we continue to report the delinquency status of these loans without considering the moratorium resulting in an increase in the reported past due loans.&nbsp;In order to reduce the servicing
cost of these loans (mostly related to principal and interest advances), we may decide to repurchase some of these delinquent mortgage loans and restructure their terms.&nbsp;However, under the GNMA program, loans originated by BPPR and pooled into
GNMA securities in our servicing portfolio that are 90 days or more past due result in us having a repurchase option and for accounting purposes, we are required to rebook these loans in our financial statements irrespective of our intent to
repurchase the loans. At December 31, 2017, our loan balances includes $840 million related to rebooked GNMA loans.&nbsp;See MD&amp;A and Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, as discussed above, because of the moratoriums, we still have limited visibility as to the impact of the hurricanes on the
financial condition of our retail customers and the credit quality of our loan portfolio, as borrowers are resuming loan repayments in the first quarter of 2018. The moratoriums, however, led to lower inflows to
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-performing</FONT> loans during the moratorium period and, as a result, our credit quality metrics as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 may not accurately reflect any adverse impact to the credit quality of our loan
portfolio we may experience as a result of Hurricanes Irma and Maria. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These hurricanes adversely affected our operations and financial
performance for 2017, resulting in additional operating expenses (net of insurance receivables) of approximately $17.0&nbsp;million and an incremental provision for loan losses related to the impact of the hurricanes of approximately
$67.6&nbsp;million. In addition, we experienced a decrease in revenues of approximately $31&nbsp;million when compared to <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-hurricane</FONT> levels, reflecting, in part, the impact of the hurricanes in a number
revenue categories, including revenues from merchant transaction activity, credit and debit card fees and other service fees and charges. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The impact of the hurricanes is expected to continue to adversely affect us during 2018, as many of our customers continue to be significantly
affected. Although management has made estimates as to the probable losses related to the hurricanes as part of its evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses, such estimates involve significant judgment and are made in the context of
significant uncertainty as to the impact that the hurricanes will have on the credit quality of our loan portfolios. In affected areas, the value of our loan collateral and the extent to which damages to properties collateralizing loans, among other
factors, may further impact those estimates of losses. The extent of the economic impact of the hurricanes is also impossible to determine with certainty at this time as it is partly dependent on the time it takes the Commonwealth government to
fully restore power and other basic infrastructure services and the effects of Federal emergency funds and private insurance proceeds. As management continues to assess the impact of these hurricanes on economic activity, asset values in Puerto
Rico, and our customers in particular, our results of operations may continue to be adversely affected, and such adverse impact could be material to us and exceed management&#146;s current estimates. </P>

certified fiscal plan nor its proposed fiscal plan submitted to the Oversight Board pursuant to PROMESA contemplates a restructuring of the debt of Puerto Rico&#146;s municipalities. The plans, however, provide for the gradual reduction of budgetary
subsidies from the central government to municipalities (by 80% of current levels by fiscal year 2023), which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of certain municipalities. Although the proposed fiscal plan contemplates that the
reduction in subsidies could be offset by other measures, such as the implementation of a modernized property tax regime, the reduction in subsidies could have a material negative impact on the financial condition of various municipalities.
Furthermore, municipalities are also likely to be affected by the negative economic and other effects resulting from expense, revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Commonwealth&#146;s fiscal and liquidity shortfalls. </P>

event of borrower default. These included $310&nbsp;million in residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (&#147;HFA&#148;), an entity that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA. These mortgage
loans are secured by the underlying properties and the HFA guarantee serves to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. Also, we had $44&nbsp;million in Puerto Rico housing bonds issued by HFA, which are secured by second
mortgage loans on Puerto Rico residential properties, $7&nbsp;million in pass-through securities that have been economically defeased and refunded and for which collateral has been escrowed, and $25&nbsp;million of commercial real estate notes

many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other
institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at
prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. We request collateral for most credit exposures with

is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. We have furthermore retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At
December&nbsp;31, 2017, we serviced $1.5&nbsp;billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the
credit recourse provided, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss. As discussed above, BPPR advanced the payment of principal and interest to such third-party investors on a scheduled basis
during the temporary payment moratoriums implemented following Hurricane Mar&iacute;a, even if such payments were not received by BPPR.<B> </B>The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse
arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2017, we repurchased approximately $
29&nbsp;million in mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. During 2018, we may incur additional losses
associated with the potential repurchase liability on loans subject to recourse as a result of the hurricanes. As of December 31, 2017, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with
credit recourse amounted to $ 59&nbsp;million. We may suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any
uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Defective and repurchased loans may harm our business

Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in Popular&#146;s stock price related to macroeconomic conditions

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Actions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to pay
higher rates than obligations of higher credit quality. Our credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009, and our senior unsecured ratings are now &#147;non-investment grade&#148; with the three major rating agencies. The market for
non-investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be
sufficient demand to complete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our banking
subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. At December&nbsp;31, 2017, the banking subsidiaries had

well-capitalized could affect our relationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit counterparties to either request
additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based on our below investment grade ratings. The fair value of derivative instruments in a liability position subject to financial covenants approximated $10&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2017, with Popular providing collateral totaling $94&nbsp;thousand to cover the net liability position with counterparties on these derivative instruments. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral requirements
thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for

a substitute fund custodian and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post collateral to
secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $48&nbsp;million at December 31, 2017. We could be required to post additional collateral under
the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce our liquidity resources
and impact its operating results. The termination of those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings
downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below investment grade. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Dodd-Frank Act, all financial companies with more than $10&nbsp;billion in total
consolidated assets, such as Popular, that are supervised by a primary federal financial regulatory agency, are required to perform an annual stress test. This stress test supports the regulator&#146;s analysis of the adequacy of a banking
organization&#146;s capital and is required as part of our capital management and review. The stress test is performed utilizing a variety of hypothetical stressed economic scenarios dictated by the Federal Reserve Board. If we are deemed to have
inadequate capital under the hypothetical scenarios, then our regulator could prohibit us from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends or repurchasing common stock, or require us to increase our regulatory capital, including through
the issuance of common stock that would dilute the ownership of existing shareholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise
the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries and will be fully-phased in January&nbsp;1, 2019. The need to maintain more capital than has been historically required and
calculated under revised standards could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also depress our return on equity, thereby making it more difficult to earn
our cost of capital. Moreover, although these new requirements are being <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">phased-in</FONT> over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account future expectations regarding the ability of banks to
meet these new requirements, including under stress conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividends and acquisitions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Due to the importance and complexity of the stress test process and capital rules calculations under Basel III, we have dedicated additional
resources to comply with these requirements. No assurance can be provided, however, that these resources will be deemed sufficient or that we will be deemed to have adequate capital under the hypothetical economic stress scenarios, which would
affect our ability to take certain capital actions in the future. In addition, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions published Basel IV in December 2017. Basel IV significantly revises the Basel capital framework, and the impact on us will
depend on the manner in which the revisions are implemented in the U.S. See the &#147;Supervision and Regulation &#150; Capital Adequacy&#148; discussion within Item 1. Business of the Annual Report for additional information related to the Basel

variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we conduct our business. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Information security risks for
large financial institutions such as Popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased
sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, hacktivists and other parties. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to
store sensitive data. We employ a defensive approach that employs people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding
suspicious activity, as well as to identify suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems, there is no assurance that all of our security
measures will be effective, especially as the threat from cyber-attacks is continuous and severe, attacks are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. We recently learned
of a phishing scam targeting our customers as a result of a recent data security incident that compromised email accounts of several Popular employees. We are contacting customers and others that we suspect may have had confidential information
accessed or that may have been targeted and are taking measures to protect them from possible adverse effects. We have addressed the vulnerability that permitted the compromise and implemented enhanced security measures. There can be no assurances,
however, that this or another incident will not result in a further breach of sensitive customer information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most significant
cyber-attack risks that we may face are e-fraud, denial-of-service, ransomware and computer intrusion that might result in loss of customer or proprietary data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds from customer or
bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the breach of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers,
and could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and
sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. Although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties, we have
not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of cyber-attacks. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of
our systems could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients,
customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems of us and those of our clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers,
loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In particular, if personal, non-public, confidential or
proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. For a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released
regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see &#147;Regulation and Supervision&#148; in Part I, Item 1&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Business, included in this Annual Report. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such
information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third
parties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision

EVERTEC.&#148; The success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these (and other) third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise
adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties&#146; suppliers or vendors (so-called &#147;fourth party risk&#148;). We may not be able to effectively monitor or

of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and
interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as
hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce
additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We rely on other companies to provide key components

those difficulties interfere with the vendor&#146;s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A significant portion of our operations are located in Puerto Rico and the USVI and BVI, a region susceptible to hurricanes and other
weather-related events. In 2017, our operations in Puerto Rico, and the USVI and BVI were significantly disrupted by the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, as discussed above under &#147;Risks Relating to the Recent Impact of Hurricanes.&#148;
Future weather events can again cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. We maintain hurricane insurance, including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there
is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic hurricane could produce to the markets that we serve and the potential negative impact to economic activity. Further, future hurricane in any of our market areas could again adversely impact
the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may further adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Man-made</FONT> disasters and other events connected with the regions in which we operate
could have similar effects. The severity and impact of future hurricanes and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The effects of future hurricanes and other weather-related events

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Potential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face, and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory
constraints. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since 2010, we have acquired the assets of two Puerto Rico based banks from the FDIC, as receiver, and various loan
portfolios from financial institutions. These acquisitions have been part of our strategy to sustain and grow our base of earning assets, particularly in Puerto Rico, where the economy has been in a prolonged recession and the population base has
been decreasing mostly as a result of outmigration trends, which have increased following Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In the future, to the extent permitted by our applicable regulators, we will continue to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities.
Acquiring other banks or businesses, however, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things, potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset
quality issues of the target company, potential disruption to our business, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company. If in connection with an acquisition we
pay a premium over book or market value, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings,
increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similarly, acquiring loan portfolios involves various risks. When acquiring loan portfolios, management makes various assumptions and
judgments about the collectability of the loans, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In estimating the extent of the losses, we
analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect,
however, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolios, which would negatively affect our operating
results. </P>

a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies. The process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult in recent years. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or
denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain
regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, BPPR entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC which provide that 80% of
losses related to specified loan portfolios that we acquired would be borne by the FDIC, subject to BPPR&#146;s compliance with<B> </B>specific terms and conditions regarding the management of the covered assets. The FDIC has the right to refuse or
delay payment for loan losses if the loss sharing agreements are not managed in accordance with their terms. Additionally, the loss sharing agreements have limited terms. The one applicable to commercial loans expired on June&nbsp;30, 2015 (with
additional recovery sharing in favor of the FDIC for three years thereafter), while the one applicable to single-family residential mortgage loans expires on June&nbsp;30, 2020. Therefore, any <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">charge-off</FONT> of
related losses that we experience after the term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negatively impact our results of operations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since 2012, BPPR and the FDIC engaged in various disputes with respect to the commercial loss share agreement, which resulted in us having to
make a material negative adjustment to the value of our loss share asset and the related <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">true-up</FONT> payment obligation to the FDIC. The last of these disputes was settled in March 2017. As of December&nbsp;31,
2017, the carrying value of covered loans approximated $ 573&nbsp;million, mainly comprised of single-family residential mortgage loans. To the extent that estimated losses on covered loans are not realized before the expiration of the applicable
loss sharing agreement or that the FDIC disputes our claims under the terms of the loss share agreement, such losses would not be subject to reimbursement from the FDIC or we may receive substantially less than claimed, which could require us to
make a material adjustment in the value of our loss share asset and the related <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">true-up</FONT> payment obligation to the FDIC and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which
such adjustment is taken. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>We are dependent on EVERTEC for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology services, which exposes us to a number of
operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the sale of a 51% ownership interest in EVERTEC
in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a long-term Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the &#147;MSA&#148;) with EVERTEC, pursuant to which we agreed to receive from EVERTEC, on an exclusive basis, certain core financial
transaction processing and information technology services, including future modifications and enhancements to such services. The term of the MSA extends until September&nbsp;30, 2025. Under the MSA, we also granted EVERTEC a right of first refusal
over certain services or products. We also entered into several other agreements, generally coterminous with the MSA, pursuant to which BPPR agreed to sponsor EVERTEC as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card
associations, agreed to certain exclusivity and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-solicitation</FONT> restrictions with respect to merchant services, and agreed to support the ATH brand and network, among other matters. As a result, we are now
dependent on EVERTEC for the provision of essential services to our business, including our core banking business, and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that EVERTEC will be able to continue to
provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing and technology services. As a result, our relationship with EVERTEC exposes us to a number of operational and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, as a result of our agreements with EVERTEC, we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of EVERTEC, including those
relating to a breakdown or failure of EVERTEC&#146;s systems, as a result of security breaches or attacks, employee error or malfeasance, system breakdowns, or otherwise. Over the term of the MSA, we have experienced various interruptions and delays
in key services provided by EVERTEC. Future interruptions in the operation of EVERTEC&#146;s information systems, or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery
of services and damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to recover from EVERTEC for breach of the MSA may not fully compensate us for the damages we may
suffer as a result of such breach. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>If EVERTEC is unable to meet constant technological changes and evolving industry standards, we may be unable to
enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The banking and financial services industry is rapidly evolving and it is highly competitive on the basis of the quality and variety of
products and services offered, innovation, price and other factors. In order to compete effectively, we need to constantly develop enhancements to our product and service offerings and introduce new products and services that keep pace with
developments in the financial services industry and satisfy shifting customer needs and preferences. These enhancements and new products and services require the delivery of technology services by EVERTEC pursuant to the MSA, making our success
dependent on EVERTEC&#146;s ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a cost-effective manner. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than EVERTEC and that may have
better technological capabilities and product offerings. Furthermore, EVERTEC is highly leveraged, which, besides exposing it to a number of financial and business risks, requires it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to meeting debt
service requirements, reducing its operational flexibility and ability to invest resources in capital and other expenditures to improve and develop its business services in a constantly changing environment. In addition, financial services
technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers&#146; compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, and in most cases
such costs are borne by the technology provider. Because of our relationship with EVERTEC, however, we bear the full cost of such developments and modifications pursuant to the MSA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If EVERTEC&#146;s technology services are not competitive in terms of price, speed and scalability versus comparable offerings from larger
companies, our future success may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if our relationship with EVERTEC hinders our ability to compete successfully, including by satisfying shifting customer needs and preferences through enhancements to our existing
products and services and the introduction of new products and services that keep pace with developments in the financial services industry, our ability to attract and retain customers and to match products and services offered by competitors could
be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Our ability to transition to a new financial services technology provider, and to replace the other services
that are provided to us by EVERTEC, may be lengthy and complex. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Switching from one vendor of core bank processing and related
technology services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks, even where such a switch can be accomplished without violating our contractual obligations to EVERTEC. The implementation cycle for such a transition
can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us. Such a transition can also expose us, and our clients, to increased costs (including conversion costs) and business disruption. If we decided to transition to a new
financial services technology provider, either at the end of the term of the MSA and related agreements or earlier upon the occurrence of a termination event, these potential transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Although EVERTEC has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the MSA, we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a
responsive and competent manner. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the MSA we are required to provide written notice of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-renewal</FONT> not less than one year prior to the relevant termination date in order to avoid an automatic three-year renewal. In practice, however, if we decided to switch to a new provider, we would have to
commence procuring and working on a transition process much earlier. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources, it could also result in an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the revenues we derive
from EVERTEC, could be materially reduced if we decided not to renew our agreements with EVERTEC or were to terminate them before the expiration of their term. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We continue to have a 16.10% ownership interest in EVERTEC and account for this investment under the equity method. As such, we include our
investment in EVERTEC in other assets and our proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations. For 2017, our share of EVERTEC&#146;s changes in equity recognized in income was
$11.6&nbsp;million. The carrying value of our investment in EVERTEC was, as of December&nbsp;31, 2017, approximately $48&nbsp;million. Meanwhile, the services EVERTEC delivers to us represent a significant portion of EVERTEC&#146;s revenues
(approximately 43% for 2017). As a result, if we were not to renew the MSA and our other agreements with EVERTEC, or otherwise terminate them before the end of their term, EVERTEC&#146;s financial position and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected and the value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the income we report from this investment, may be materially reduced. Furthermore, revenue from EVERTEC&#146;s merchant acquiring business, which
constitutes approximately 21% of EVERTEC&#146;s revenues, depends, in part, on EVERTEC&#146;s alliance with BPPR. If such relationship were to suffer, EVERTEC&#146;s business may be adversely affected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Furthermore, future sales of our EVERTEC common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price
of EVERTEC common stock and thus the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR
SECURITIES </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The issuance of additional shares of equity securities could further dilute existing holders of our Common Stock. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have not issued equity securities since 2010, other than in connection with compensation plans or our dividend reinvestment plan. In the
future, however, we may raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations or expansions, to pursue acquisitions or to increase our capital to comply with regulatory capital measures. If we raise funds by issuing equity
securities, or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders would be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our Common Stock or
outstanding Preferred Stock, and the issuance could be at a price which is dilutive to current stockholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Dividends on our Common Stock and
Preferred Stock may be suspended and stockholders may not receive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or Preferred Stock without selling their shares. </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Holders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds
legally available for such payments. During 2009, we suspended dividend payments on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. We resumed payment of dividends on our Preferred Stock in December 2010 and on our Common Stock in October 2015. There can be
no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the Preferred Stock or Common Stock in any future periods. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. Also, we
are a bank holding company and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is Federal Reserve
Board policy that bank holding companies should pay dividends on common stock only out of the net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the
organization&#146;s current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the terms of
our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by each trust that has issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our Common Stock and Preferred
Stock, or from purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Accordingly, shareholders may have to sell some or all of their shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock in order to generate cash flow
from their investment. Shareholders may not realize a gain on their investment when they sell the Common Stock or Preferred Stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Certain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and
may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of
the Board of Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and the other directors will remain
in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our
certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two -thirds of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled
to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to
discourage attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for
the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For further information
