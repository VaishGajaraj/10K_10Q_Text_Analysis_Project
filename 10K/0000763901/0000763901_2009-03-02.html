</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The information included in this Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
forward-looking statements may relate to the Corporation&#146;s financial condition, results of
operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including, but not limited
to, statements with respect to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, market risk
and the impact of interest rate changes, capital markets conditions, capital adequacy and
liquidity, and the effect of legal proceedings and new accounting standards on the
Corporation&#146;s financial condition and results of operations. All statements contained
herein that are not clearly historical in nature are forward-looking, and the words
&#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;continues,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;project&#148; and
similar expressions and future or conditional verbs such as &#147;will,&#148; &#147;would,&#148; &#147;should,&#148;
&#147;could,&#148; &#147;might,&#148; &#147;can,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; or similar expressions are generally intended to identify
forward-looking statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks,
uncertainties, estimates and assumptions by management that are difficult to predict.
Various factors, some of which are beyond the Corporation&#146;s control, could cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking
statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to:
the rate of growth in the economy, as well as general business and economic conditions;
changes in interest rates, as well as the magnitude of such changes; the fiscal and
monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies; the relative strength or
weakness of the consumer and commercial credit sectors and of the real estate markets; the
performance of the stock and bond markets; competition in the financial services industry;
possible legislative, tax or regulatory changes; and difficulties in combining the
operations of acquired entities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">All forward-looking statements included in this document are based upon information
available to the Corporation as of the date of this document, and we assume no obligation
to update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect occurrences or
unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Moreover, the outcome of legal proceedings, as discussed in &#147;Part&nbsp;I, Item&nbsp;3. Legal
Proceedings,&#148; is inherently uncertain and depends on judicial interpretations of law and
the findings of regulators, judges and juries.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular,
Inc. (the &#147;Corporation&#148; or &#147;Popular&#148;) is a diversified, publicly owned bank holding
company, registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;BHC
Act&#148;) and, accordingly, subject to the supervision and regulation of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;the Federal Reserve Board&#148;). The Corporation
was incorporated in 1984 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and is the
largest financial institution based in Puerto Rico, with consolidated assets of
$38.9&nbsp;billion, total deposits of $27.6&nbsp;billion and stockholders&#146; equity of $3.3&nbsp;billion at December
31, 2008.
At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Corporation ranked 29th among bank holding companies based on
total assets according to information gathered and disclosed by the Federal Reserve
System.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation operates in three target markets: Puerto Rico, the mainland United
States and processing and other technology services in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Florida
and the Dominican Republic.
</DIV>

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation offers in Puerto Rico a complete array of retail and commercial
banking services through its principal bank subsidiary, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico
(&#147;Banco Popular&#148; or the &#147;Bank&#148;). Banco Popular was organized in 1893 and is Puerto
Rico&#146;s largest bank with consolidated total assets of
$25.5&nbsp;billion, deposits of $18.4&nbsp;billion and stockholder&#146;s equity of $1.9&nbsp;billion at

Corporation at December&nbsp;31, 2008. Banco Popular has the largest retail franchise in Puerto
Rico, with 179 branches and over 600 automated teller machines. The Bank also operates

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak economic conditions in Puerto Rico as well as the Corporation&#146;s efforts
to reduce costs, contain credit losses and further increase the profitability of the
core Puerto Rico operations led Banco Popular to consolidate its consumer-finance
subsidiary, Popular Finance, Inc. (&#147;Popular Finance&#148;) into its retail banking
operations during 2008. Popular Finance ceased to originate loans on November&nbsp;1, 2008. Some of
Popular Finance&#146;s 44 branches continued to operate as customer-service centers. The
remaining branches of Popular Finance were closed or are in the process of being sold. All
Popular Finance employees who were not supporting the customer service centers were
relocated to support other business lines at Banco Popular. In addition, on January
22, 2009, the FDIC approved the merger of Popular Finance with and into the Bank. The
merger was consummated on February&nbsp;28, 2009.

Popular has two other subsidiaries: Popular Auto, Inc., a vehicle financing,

brokerage services for institutional and retail customers through Popular Securities,

securities broker-dealer with operations in Puerto Rico. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2008, Popular Securities had $318&nbsp;million in
total assets.

Corporation has other three wholly-owned subsidiaries. The first, PIB was organized in 1992

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the disruption in the capital markets since the summer of 2007 and its

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">the Corporation closed Equity One&#146;s consumer service branches during the first quarter of
2008 as part of the initiatives to exit the subprime loan origination operations at PFH.
Restructuring charges which resulted from the PFH Branch Network Restructuring Plan
totaled $17.4&nbsp;million for 2008 and consisted mainly of severance, retention bonuses and
other benefits and lease terminations. The Corporation does not expect to incur additional
restructuring costs related to the PFH Branch Network Restructuring Plan.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2008, the Corporation entered into an additional restructuring plan for
its PFH operations to eliminate employment positions, terminate contracts and incur
other costs associated with the discontinuance of PFH&#146;s operations. Restructuring charges recorded during 2008 consisted mainly of
severance, retention bonuses and other benefits which totaled $4.1&nbsp;million and
impairment losses on long-lived assets of $3.9&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time equivalent employees at the PFH discontinued operations decreased from
930 at December&nbsp;31, 2007 to 200 at December&nbsp;31, 2008. The employees that remain at PFH
are expected to depart by mid-2009 or be transferred to other of the Corporation&#146;s U.S.
mainland subsidiaries for support functions. For further information of PFH
restructuring plans please refer to the PFH Restructuring and Integration Plan Section

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>BPNA Restructuring Plan</I>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, on October&nbsp;17, 2008, the Board of Directors approved restructuring plans at
its U.S. mainland operations, BPNA and E-LOAN, with the objective of establishing a
leaner, more efficient U.S. business model suited to present economic conditions,
improving profitability in the short term, increasing liquidity, lowering credit costs,
and over time achieving a greater integration with corporate functions in Puerto Rico.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BPNA Restructuring Plan consists mainly of a number of initiatives grouped
into three work streams: (1)&nbsp;branch network actions, (2)&nbsp;balance sheet initiatives, and
(3)&nbsp;general expense reductions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
part of the branch network actions, management expects that
approximately 40 underperforming
branches, out of a total of 139, will be sold, closed, or consolidated in 2009. These
branches were selected because they rank lowest within BPNA&#146;s network in
both current profitability and potential for growth. Branch actions are distributed
across all regions, including California, New Jersey, New York, Florida, Illinois and
Texas. The Corporation will close or consolidate
those branches for which it is unable to reach an agreement with a potential buyer.
The branches that were identified for divesture held approximately
$720&nbsp;million in deposits at December&nbsp;31, 2008.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance sheet initiatives aim to significantly downsize or exit
asset-generating businesses that are not relationship-based and/or whose profitability
is being severely impacted by the current credit and economic conditions. As part of
this initiative, the Corporation exited certain businesses in the U.S. including,
among the principal ones, those related to the origination of non-conventional
mortgages, equipment lease financing, loans to professionals, multifamily lending,
mixed used commercial loans and credit cards. These business lines
held a loan portfolio of approximately $2.1&nbsp;billion at
December&nbsp;31, 2008. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, BPNA had already
stopped originating loans in these portfolios. The Corporation holds the existing
related businesses portfolio in a run-off mode. The existing equipment lease financing
portfolio was primarily held-for-sale at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and a
significant portion was sold in February&nbsp;2009. Also, the BPNA Restructuring Plan
contemplates downsizing the following businesses: business banking, SBA lending, and
consumer / mortgage lending. These latter efforts were also completed. The downsizing
in SBA lending contemplates a migration from a nationwide and broker-based business
model to a significant smaller regional and branch-based model.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general expense reduction initiative looks to capture cost savings in the
support functions directly related with the reductions in the branch network and
lending businesses, as well as to identify additional opportunities to cut
discretionary expenses, such as professional fees, traveling and other expenses. The
BPNA Restructuring Plan also contemplates greater integration with corporate functions
in Puerto Rico. These efforts are expected to result in approximately $50&nbsp;million in recurrent
annual cost savings. The majority of the savings are related to personnel costs since the
restructuring plan incorporates a
workforce reduction of approximately 640 full-time equivalent
employees (&#147;FTEs&#148;), or 30% of BPNA&#146;s workforce.
Management expects the workforce reduction to be achieved by the third quarter of 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
2008 restructuring charges and impairment losses associated to the
BPNA Restructuring Plan amounted to $19.7&nbsp;million. An additional $12.9 million in associated costs are expected to be incurred in 2009. FTEs at BPNA, excluding E-LOAN, were 1,831 at December&nbsp;31, 2008, compared to 2,157 at
the same date in the previous year.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
E-LOAN Restructuring Plan involved E-LOAN ceasing to operate as a direct lender, an event that
occurred in late 2008. E-LOAN will continue to market deposit accounts under its name
for the benefit of BPNA and offer loan customers the option of being referred to a
consumer lending partner. As part of the E-LOAN 2008 Restructuring Plan, all
operational and support functions will be transferred to BPNA and
EVERTEC. Total annualized savings are expected to reach
$37&nbsp;million. The restructuring costs and impairment losses of implementing the E-LOAN 2008 Restructuring Plan
totaled $22 million during 2008. The Corporation estimates additional
restructuring expenses of approximately $2 million for 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, E-LOAN&#146;s workforce totaled 270 FTEs, compared to 767 FTEs at

applicable to the Corporation, PIB, PNA and their respective subsidiaries. The

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation, PIB and PNA are bank holding companies subject to
consolidated supervision and
regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. Under the BHC Act, prior to
the adoption of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, the activities of bank holding
companies and their non-banking subsidiaries were limited to the business of banking
and activities closely related to banking, and no bank holding company could directly
or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of any
class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company in the United States,
including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In addition,
bank holding companies generally have been prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging
in non-banking activities, unless they were found by the Federal Reserve Board to be
closely related to banking. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act authorized bank holding
companies that qualify as &#147;financial holding companies&#148; to engage in a substantially
broader range of non-banking activities, subject to certain conditions. The Corporation
has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the provisions of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. See &#147;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act &#148; below for information
regarding changes to these rules. The BHC Act, as amended by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, provides generally for &#147;umbrella&#148;
regulation of financial holding companies and their non-bank
subsidiaries by the Federal Reserve Board, and for functional
regulation of banking activities by bank regulators, securities
activities by securities regulators, and insurance activities by
insurance regulators
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to supervision and examination by applicable
federal and state banking agencies including, in the case of Banco Popular, the Federal
Reserve Board and the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto
Rico (the &#147;Office of the Commissioner&#148;), and in the case of BPNA, the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking
Department. Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to requirements and restrictions under
federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits,
restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest
that may be charged thereon, and limitations on the other types of investments that may
be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and
regulations also affect the operations of Banco Popular and BPNA. See
&#147;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&#148; below for information about changes made to these rules. In addition to the
impact of regulations, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of
the Federal Reserve Board as it attempts to control the money supply and credit
availability in order to influence the economy.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Prompt Corrective Action</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#147;FDIA&#148;) requires, among other things, the
federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository
institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five
capital tiers: &#147;well capitalized&#148;, &#147;adequately capitalized&#148;, &#147;undercapitalized&#148;,
&#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148;, and &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148;. The relevant
capital measures are the total risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital
ratio and the leverage ratio.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules adopted by the federal banking agencies provide that a depository
institution will be deemed to be (1)&nbsp;well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio
of at least 5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a total risk-based
capital ratio of at least 10% and is not subject to any written agreement or directive
to meet a specific capital level; (2)&nbsp;adequately capitalized, if it is not well
capitalized, but maintains a leverage ratio of at least 4% (or at least 3% if given the
highest regulatory rating in its most recent report of examination and not experiencing
or anticipating significant growth), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4%
and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%; (3)&nbsp;undercapitalized if it
fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized institutions (unless it is
deemed significantly or critically undercapitalized); (4)&nbsp;significantly
undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based
capital ratio of less than 3% or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%; and
(5)&nbsp;critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to 2% or less of total
assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2008, Banco Popular and BPNA were both well capitalized. An
institution&#146;s capital category, as determined by applying the prompt corrective action
provisions of law, may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall
financial condition or prospects of the institution, and the capital condition of the
Corporation&#146;s banking subsidiaries should be considered in conjunction with other
available information regarding the Corporation&#146;s financial condition and results of
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances,
reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized.
The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or
undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the
institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly
undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory
information other than the capital levels of the institution.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate
federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the
institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be
engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital
distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its
holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.
Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from
the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are
subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A
depository institution&#146;s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an
amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#146;s assets at the time it
becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution
fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital
plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic
assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital.
If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it
is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized depository
institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including
orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements
to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a
receiver or conservator.

the transfer of funds by any of them to the Corporation, PIB, PNA, or any of the
Corporation&#146;s other non-banking subsidiaries, whether in the form of loans, other
extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases. Such transfers by Banco Popular
and BPNA to any of the Corporation, PIB, PNA, or any of the Corporation&#146;s other
non-banking subsidiaries are limited in amount to 10% of the transferring institution&#146;s
capital stock and surplus and, with respect to the Corporation and all of its
non-banking subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the transferring institution&#146;s
capital stock and surplus. For these purposes an institution&#146;s capital stock and
surplus includes its total risk-based capital plus (1)&nbsp;the balance of its allowance for
loan losses not included therein and (2)&nbsp;the amount of certain investments made by the
institution in &#147;financial subsidiaries&#148; that is subject to these limits and is required
to be deducted from the institution&#146;s capital for regulatory capital purposes.
Furthermore, any such loans and extensions
of credit are required to be secured in specified amounts. In addition, federal
law requires that any transaction between Banco Popular or BPNA, on the one hand, and
the Corporation, PIB, PNA or any of the Corporation&#146;s other non-banking subsidiaries,
on the other hand, be carried out on an arm&#146;s length basis.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company such as the
Corporation, PIB or PNA is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of
its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each subsidiary bank. This
support may be required at times when, absent such policy, the bank holding company
might not otherwise provide such support. In addition, any capital loans by a bank
holding company to any of its subsidiary depository institutions are subordinated in
right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary
depository institution. In the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any
commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the
capital of a subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy
trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. Banco Popular and BPNA are currently
the only depository institution subsidiaries of the Corporation, PIB and PNA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Corporation, PIB and PNA are holding companies, their right to
participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#146;s liquidation or
reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#146;s creditors
(including depositors in the case of subsidiary depository institutions) except to the
extent that the Corporation, PIB or PNA, as the case may be, may itself be a creditor
with recognized claims against the subsidiary.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the FDIA, a depository institution, the deposits of which are insured by the
FDIC, can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be
incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i)&nbsp;the default of a commonly controlled
FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii)&nbsp;any assistance provided by the FDIC to any
commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution &#147;in danger of default&#148;.
&#147;Default&#148; is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or a receiver, and
&#147;in danger of default&#148; is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions
indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.
Banco Popular and BPNA are currently FDIC-insured depository institution subsidiaries
of the Corporation and are subject to this cross-guarantee liability. In some
circumstances (depending upon the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by
the FDIC), cross-guarantee liability may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency
of one or more insured depository institutions in a holding company structure. Any
obligation or liability owed by a subsidiary depository institution to its parent
company and other affiliates is subordinated to the subsidiary depository institution&#146;s cross-guarantee
liability with respect to commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institutions.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Banco Popular may pay to the Corporation without regulatory approval. As a member bank
subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, Banco Popular must obtain the
approval of the Federal Reserve Board for any dividend, if the total of all dividends
declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net
income (as reportable in its Report of Condition and Income) for that year, combined with
its retained net income (as defined by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any
required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. In
addition, a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its
undivided profits as reported in its Report of Condition and Income, unless the member
bank has received the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A member bank also may not
permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been
approved by the Federal Reserve Board. For this purpose, permanent capital means the total
of the bank&#146;s perpetual preferred stock and related surplus,
Common Stock and surplus and
minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, as reportable in the Report of Condition
and Income. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, Banco Popular could have declared a dividend of
approximately $32&nbsp;million without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board and BPNA could
not declare any dividends without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment of dividends by Banco Popular and BPNA may also be affected by other
regulatory requirements and policies, such as the maintenance of adequate capital. If,
in the opinion of the
applicable regulatory authority, a depository institution under its jurisdiction
is engaged in, or is about to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (that, depending
on the financial condition of the depository institution, could include the payment of
dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such depository
institution cease and desist from such practice. The FDIC has indicated that the
payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice if the payment
would deplete a depository institution&#146;s capital base to an inadequate level. Under the
FDIA, an insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to
become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. See &#147;Prompt Corrective
Action&#148; above. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have issued policy
statements stating that the bank holding companies and insured banks should generally
pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In the current
financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has
indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their
dividend policy and has discouraged dividend pay-out ratios that are
at the 100% or higher level unless both asset quality and capital are
very strong. The Corporation is also subject to dividend restrictions
because of its participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program.

the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are subject to a withholding tax of 10%

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banco Popular and BPNA are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. In 2006
the President signed the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the &#147;Reform
Act&#148;). The Reform Act provided for the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund (&#147;BIF&#148;) and
Savings Association Insurance Fund (&#147;SAIF&#148;) into a single Deposit Insurance Fund, an
increase in the maximum amount of FDIC insurance coverage for certain retirement
accounts, and possible &#147;inflation adjustments&#148; in the maximum amount of coverage
available with respect to other insured accounts. In addition, it granted a one-time
initial assessment credit (of approximately $4.7&nbsp;billion) to recognize institutions&#146;
past contributions to the fund.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
deposits of Banco Popular, excluding the deposits of the branch
located in the British Virgin Islands, and BPNA are insured up to the
applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance
assessments to maintain the DIF.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Reform Act, the FDIC made significant changes to its risk-based
assessment system so that effective January&nbsp;1, 2007 the FDIC imposes insurance premiums
based upon a matrix that is designed to more closely tie what banks pay for deposit
insurance to the risks they pose. The new FDIC risk-based assessment system imposed
premiums based upon factors that vary depending upon the size of the bank. These
factors are: for banks with less than $10&nbsp;billion in assets &#151; capital level,
supervisory rating, weighted average CAMELS component rating, and

$10&nbsp;billion and over in assets &#151; capital level, supervisory rating,
weighted average CAMELS component ratings, long-term debt issuer ratings (unless
none are available in which case certain financial ratios are used), and additional risk
information. The FDIC subsequently adopted a new base schedule of rates that the FDIC can adjust up
or down, depending on the revenue needs of the DIF, and  set initial premiums that
range from 5 cents per $100 of domestic deposits for the banks in the lowest risk category
to 43 cents per $100 of domestic deposits for banks in the highest risk category. This
assessment system resulted in a 2008 annual assessment rate on the deposits of the Corporation&#146;s bank
subsidiaries between 6 and 10 cents per $100 of deposits. During 2008 our bank
subsidiaries utilized the remaining balance of the FDIC credit to offset a portion of the
2008 insurance premium assessment.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;3, 2008, President George W. Bush signed into law the Emergency
Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (&#147;EESA&#148;), which temporarily raised the basic limit
on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. The
temporary increase in deposit insurance coverage became effective upon the President&#146;s
signature. The legislation provides that the basic deposit insurance limit will return
to $100,000 after December&nbsp;31, 2009. The legislation did not increase coverage for
retirement accounts; which continues to be $250,000.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;21, 2008, the Board of Directors of the FDIC approved the TLGP to
strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. The TLGP is
comprised of the Debt Guarantee Program (&#147;DGP&#148;) and the Transaction Account Guarantee
Program (&#147;TAGP&#148;). The DGP guarantees all newly issued senior unsecured debt (e.g.,
promissory notes, unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper) up to prescribed
limits issued by participating entities, including bank holding companies, beginning on
October&nbsp;14, 2008 and continuing through October&nbsp;31, 2009. For eligible debt issued by
that date, the FDIC will provide the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the
maturity date of the debt or June&nbsp;30, 2012. The TAGP offers a full guarantee for non
interest-bearing transaction deposit accounts held at FDIC-insured depository institutions. The
unlimited deposit coverage is voluntary for eligible institutions and
is in
addition to the $250,000 FDIC deposit insurance per depositor  that was included as part
of the EESA. The TAGP coverage became effective on October&nbsp;14, 2008 and will continue
for participating institutions until December&nbsp;31, 2009. Popular, Inc. opted to become a
participating entity on both of these programs and will pay applicable fees for
participation. Participants in the DGP program have a fee structure based on a
sliding scale, depending on length of maturity. Shorter-term debt have a lower fee
structure and longer-term debt have a higher fee. The range is 50 basis
points on debt of 180&nbsp;days or less, and a maximum of 100 basis points for debt with
maturities of one year or longer, on an annualized basis. Any eligible entity that has
not chosen to opt out of the TAGP is assessed, on a quarterly basis, an annualized
10&nbsp;cents per $100 fee on balances in non interest bearing transaction accounts that exceed the
existing deposit insurance limit of $250,000.

December 16, 2008, the Board of Directors of the FDIC voted to adopt
a final rule increasing risk-based assessment rates uniformly by
seven basis points, on an annual basis, for the first quarter of
2009. As mentioned above, previously banks paid between 5 and
43&nbsp;cents per $100 of their domestic deposits for FDIC insurance.
Under this final rule, risk-based rates will range between 12 and
50&nbsp;cents per $100 of domestic deposits (annualized) for the
first quarter 2009 assessment. Most institutions will be charged
between 12 and 14&nbsp;cents per $100 of deposits. On
February&nbsp;27, 2009, the Board of Directors of the FDIC voted to
adopt a final rule to alter the way in which the FDIC&#146;s
risk-based assessment system differentiates for risk, change deposit
insurance assessment rates, and make technical and other changes to
the rules governing the risk-based assessment system. Under this
final rule, risk-based rates will range between 12 and 45&nbsp;cents
per $100 of domestic deposits (annualized) and between 7 and
77.5&nbsp;cents per $100 of domestic deposits after adjustments,
effective April&nbsp;1, 2009. Most institutions will be charged
between 7 and 24&nbsp;cents per $100 of deposits. Also on
February&nbsp;27, 2009, the Board of Directors of the FDIC voted to
adopt an interim final rule to impose an emergency special assessment
of 20&nbsp;cents per $100 of deposits on June&nbsp;30, 2009, and to
allow the FDIC to impose emergency special assessments after
June&nbsp;30, 2009 of 10&nbsp;cents per $100 of deposits if the
reserve ratio of the DIF is estimated to fall to a level that the
FDIC believes would adversely affect public confidence or to a level
that is close to zero or negative at the end of a calendar quarter.

companies and
member banks, the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital (&#147;Total Capital&#148;) to
risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby
letters of credit) is 8%. Under the capital guidelines, a banking organization&#146;s Total
Capital is divided into tiers. &#147;Tier 1 Capital&#148; consists of common equity, retained
earnings, minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, qualifying
non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual
preferred stock less goodwill (net of any associated deferred tax liability) and
certain other intangible assets. Banking organizations are expected
to maintain at least 50 percent of their Tier 1 Capital as common
equity. Not more than 25% of qualifying Tier 1 Capital may
consist of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, trust preferred securities or other
&#147;so-called&#148; restricted core capital elements. In addition, effective October&nbsp;17, 2008,
the Federal Reserve Board approved an interim rule to allow the inclusion of the senior
perpetual preferred stock issued to the Treasury Department under the TARP Capital
Purchase Program, without limit, as Tier 1 capital. &#147;Tier 2 Capital&#148; consists of,
among other things, a limited amount of subordinated debt, other preferred stock,
certain other instruments and a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves. &#147;Tier 3
Capital&#148; consists of qualifying unsecured subordinated debt. The sum of Tier 2 and Tier
3 Capital may not exceed the amount of Tier 1 Capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage ratio
guidelines for bank holding companies and member banks. These guidelines provide for a
minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total assets, less goodwill and certain other
intangible assets discussed below (the &#147;leverage ratio&#148;) of 3% for bank holding
companies and member banks that have the highest regulatory rating or have implemented
the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s market risk capital measure. All other bank holding
companies and member banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. The
guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or
making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially
above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible
assets. Furthermore, the guidelines indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will
continue to consider a &#147;tangible Tier 1 leverage ratio&#148; and other indicia of capital
strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. The tangible Tier 1
leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization&#146;s Tier 1 Capital less all
intangibles, to total assets less all intangibles.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a new set of risk-based capital standards (&#147;Basel II&#148;) in order to update the original international capital standards that had been
 put in place in 1988 (&#147;Basel I&#148;). Basel II presents a
three-pillar framework for determining risk-based capital requirements for credit risk, market risk and operational risk (Pillar 1); supervisory review of capital adequacy (Pillar 2); and market discipline through enhanced public
 disclosure (Pillar 3). A definitive final rule for implementing the
advanced approaches of Basel II in the United States, which applies
only to certain large or internationally active or &#147;core&#148;
banking organizations (defined as those with consolidated total assets of $250 billion or more or consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion or more) became effective
on April 1, 2008. Other U.S. banking
organizations may elect to adopt the requirements of this rule (if
they meet applicable qualification requirements), but are not required to comply. The rule also allows a banking organization&#146;s primary Federal supervisor to determine that application of the rule would not be appropriate in light of the bank&#146;s asset size, level of complexity, risk profile or scope of operations.


</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To correct differences between core and non-core banking organizations, Basel IA
was proposed in late 2006 presenting modifications to the general risk-based capital
rules for non-core banking organizations that do not adopt the
advanced approaches. After
considering the comments on both the Basel IA and the advanced approaches, in July
2008, the agencies proposed a new rule that would provide all non-core banking
organizations with an option to adopt the standardized approach under Basel II. This
alternative provides a more risk sensitive capital framework to institutions not
adopting the advanced approaches without unduly increasing regulatory
burden. Comments on the proposed rule were due to the agencies by
October 27, 2008, but a definitive final rule has not been issued.
The proposed rule, if adopted, will replace the Basel IA approach.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the weaknesses revealed by the financial market crisis, in January
2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a consultative package
proposing enhancements to strengthen the regulation and supervision of internationally
active banks. The proposed enhancements will help ensure that the risks inherent in
banks&#146; portfolios related to trading activities, securitizations and
exposures to off-balance sheet vehicles are better reflected in minimum capital
requirements (Pillar 1), risk management practices (Pillar 2) and accompanying
disclosures to the public (Pillar 3).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Corporation is a non-core banking organization, the Corporation
understands that the new capital adequacy guidelines provide a framework which more
closely aligns regulatory capital requirements with actual risks, thus enhancing risk
management practices.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#147;FASB&#148;) issued FASB
Interpretation No.&nbsp;46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (&#147;FIN 46&#148;), which
addresses the consolidation rules to be applied to &#147;variable interest entities&#148; as
defined in FIN 46. In December&nbsp;2003 the FASB amended FIN 46 in FASB interpretation No.
46 (revised December&nbsp;2003) (&#147;FIN 46R&#148;). FIN 46R, applies to certain variable interest
entities by no later than March&nbsp;15, 2004. Under FIN 46R issuer trusts may constitute
variable interest entities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, issuer trusts that issued trust preferred securities have been
consolidated by their parent companies and the accounts of such issuer trusts have been
included in the consolidated financial statements of such parent companies. In
addition, trust preferred securities have been treated as eligible for Tier 1 capital
treatment by bank holding companies under Federal Reserve Board rules and regulations
relating to minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2008, $824&nbsp;million in trust preferred securities that the Corporation
treated as Tier 1 capital under existing Federal Reserve Board guidelines were
outstanding. The Corporation has determined that the issuer trusts for its trust
preferred securities transactions are variable interest entities. The variable interest
entities were deconsolidated commencing with the Corporation&#146;s December&nbsp;31, 2003
financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;1, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that allows the
continued limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the Tier 1 capital of bank
holding companies (BHCs). Under the final rule, trust preferred securities and other
restricted core capital elements became subject to stricter quantitative limits.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Reserve Board&#146;s final rule limits restricted core capital elements to
25&nbsp;percent of all core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred
tax liability. Internationally active BHCs, defined as those with consolidated assets
greater than $250&nbsp;billion or on-balance-sheet foreign exposure greater than $10
billion, are subject to a 15&nbsp;percent limit. They may, however, include qualifying
mandatory convertible preferred securities up to the generally applicable 25&nbsp;percent
limit. Amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of these limits generally
may be included in Tier 2 capital. The final rule provides a five-year transition
period, ending March&nbsp;31, 2009, for application of the quantitative limits. The
Corporation will be in compliance with the applicable 25&nbsp;percent limit at March&nbsp;31,

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 amended
the FDIA to permit a bank holding company, with Federal Reserve Board approval, to
acquire banks located in states other than the holding company&#146;s home state without
regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law. In addition, national
and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines,
with approval of the appropriate federal banking agency. States are also allowed to
permit de novo interstate branching. Once a bank has established branches in a state
through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish or acquire additional
branches at any location in the state where any bank involved in the interstate merger
transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or
state law. A bank that has established a branch in a state through de novo branching
(if permitted under state laws) may establish and acquire additional branches in such
state in the same manner and to the same extent as a bank having a branch in such state
as a result of an interstate merger. If a state opted out of interstate branching
within the specified time period, no bank in any other state may establish a branch in
the state that has opted out, whether through an acquisition or de novo. For purposes
of the Riegle-Neal Act amendments to the FDIA, Banco Popular is treated as a state bank
and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks.
However, for purposes of the International Banking Act (the &#147;IBA&#148;), Banco Popular is
considered to be a foreign
bank and may branch interstate by merger or de novo to the same extent as a
domestic bank in Banco Popular&#146;s home state, which is New York for purposes of the IBA.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was enacted on November&nbsp;12, 1999. Among other things,
the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: (i)&nbsp;allows bank holding companies whose subsidiary
depository institutions meet management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act
standards to engage in a substantially broader range of nonbanking
financial activities than what was
previously permissible, including securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking
investments in  nonfinancial companies; (ii)&nbsp;allows insurers and other
financial services companies to acquire banks; (iii)&nbsp;removes various restrictions that
previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual
fund advisory companies; and (iv)&nbsp;establishes the overall regulatory structure
applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a bank holding company to engage in the broader range of activities
that are permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (i)&nbsp;all of its depository institution
subsidiaries must be well capitalized (as described above) and well managed and (ii)&nbsp;it
must file a declaration with the Federal Reserve that it elects to be a &#147;financial
holding company.&#148; The Corporation, PIB and PNA have elected to be treated as financial
holding companies. A depository institution is deemed to be &#147;well managed&#148; if at its
most recent inspection, examination or subsequent review by the appropriate federal
banking agency (or the appropriate state banking agency), the depository institution
received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; composite rating and at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148;
rating for management. In addition, to commence any new activity permitted by the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and to acquire any company engaged in any new activities
permitted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary
of the financial holding company must have received at least a &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating in
its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act. If,
after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities
not permissible for a bank holding company that is not a financial
holding company, the company fails to continue to meet any of the
requirements for financial holding company status, the company must
enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to comply with
all applicable capital and management requirements. If the
company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal
Reserve Board may  order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or
the company may discontinue, and divest investments in companies
engaged in, activities permissible only for a bank holding company
that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company
or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate  its
ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board
has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity
or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the
financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of
the bank holding company.</DIV>

country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to
a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#147;U.S. persons&#148; engaging in financial
transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice

property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>General. </I></B>As a commercial bank organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, Banco
Popular is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Office of the
Commissioner, pursuant to the Puerto Rico Banking Act of 1933, as amended (the
&#147;Banking Law&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law requires that at least ten percent (10%) of the
yearly net income of Banco Popular be credited annually to a reserve fund. This
apportionment must be done every year until the reserve fund is equal to the total of
paid-in capital on common and preferred stock. During 2008 Banco Popular transferred
$18&nbsp;million to the reserve fund in order to comply with this requirement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;27 of the Banking Law also provides that when the expenditures of a bank
are greater than its receipts, the excess of the former over the latter must be charged
against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, must be charged
against the reserve fund. If the reserve fund is not sufficient to cover such balance
in whole or in part, the outstanding amount must be charged against the capital account
and no dividend may be declared until capital has been restored to its original amount
and the reserve fund to 20% of the original capital.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;16 of the Banking Law requires every bank to maintain a legal reserve
that, except as otherwise provided by the Office of the Commissioner, may not be less
than 20% of its demand liabilities, excluding government deposits (federal, state and
municipal) which are secured by collateral. If a bank is authorized to establish one or
more bank branches in a state of the United States or in a foreign country, where such
branches are subject to the reserve requirements of that state or country, the Office
of the Commissioner may exempt said branch or branches from the reserve requirements of
Section&nbsp;16. Pursuant to an order of the Federal Reserve Board dated November&nbsp;24, 1982,
Banco Popular has been exempted from the reserve requirements of the Federal Reserve
System with respect to deposits payable in Puerto Rico. Accordingly, Banco Popular is
subject to the reserve requirements prescribed by the Banking Law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;17 of the Banking Law permits a bank to make loans to any one person,
firm, partnership or corporation, up to an aggregate amount of fifteen percent (15%) of
the paid-in capital and reserve fund of the bank. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the legal
lending limit for the Bank under this provision was approximately $122&nbsp;million. In the
case of loans which are secured by collateral worth at least 25% more than the amount
of the loan the maximum aggregate amount is increased to one third of the paid-in
capital of the bank, plus its reserve fund. If the institution is well capitalized and
had been rated 1 in the last examination performed by the Office of the Commissioner or
any regulatory agency, its legal lending limit shall also include 15% of 50% of its
undivided profits and for loans secured by collateral
worth at least 25% more than the amount of the loan, the capital of the bank shall
also include 33 1/3% of 50% of its undivided profits. Institutions rated 2 in their
last regulatory examination may include this additional component in their legal
lending limit only with the previous authorization of the Office of the Commissioner.
There are no restrictions under Section&nbsp;17 on the amount of loans that are wholly
secured by bonds, securities and other evidence of indebtedness of the Government of
the United States or Puerto Rico, or by current debt bonds, not in default, of
municipalities or instrumentalities of Puerto Rico.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;14 of the Banking Law authorizes a bank to conduct certain financial and
related activities directly or through subsidiaries, including finance leasing of personal
property and originating and servicing mortgage loans.
Banco Popular engages in these activities through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Popular
Auto, Inc. and Popular Mortgage, Inc., respectively, both companies are organized and
operate in Puerto Rico.

it fails to comply with the IBC Act, regulations issued by the Office of the
Commissioner or the terms of its license or if the Office of the Commissioner finds
that the business of the IBE is conducted in a manner not consistent with the public

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January&nbsp;2004, the Government of Puerto Rico approved a legislation that
partially eliminates the tax exempt status of an IBE that operates as a division or
branch of a bank in Puerto Rico. In order to be subject to tax, the IBE&#146;s net taxable
income must exceed 20%, of the net taxable income of the bank as a whole. If these
thresholds are exceeded, the IBE will be taxed at regular tax rates on its net taxable
income that exceeds the applicable threshold. Currently, management of the Corporation
does not expect any financial impact from this law because the net taxable income of
Banco Popular&#146;s IBE has not exceeded and is not expected to exceed 20% of Banco
Popular&#146;s net taxable income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Transactions with Doral Financial Corporation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Doral Announcements. </I></B>In April&nbsp;2005, Doral Financial Corporation (&#147;Doral&#148;) announced that its
previously filed financial statements for periods from January&nbsp;1, 2000 through December&nbsp;31, 2004
should no longer be relied on and that the financial statements for some or all of the periods
included therein should be restated because of issues relating to the methodology used to calculate
the fair value of its portfolio of floating rate interest-only strips (&#147;IOs&#148;). On February&nbsp;27,
2006, Doral filed a Form 10-K/A (Amendment No.&nbsp;1) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004 (the
&#147;Amended Doral 2004 10-K&#148;). In the Amended Doral 2004 10-K, Doral stated that it was reducing its
retained earnings through December&nbsp;31, 2004 by $921&nbsp;million on a pre-tax basis and that $596
million of the $921&nbsp;million reduction was attributable to recharacterization of mortgage loan sales
transactions as secured borrowings and $283&nbsp;million was attributable to valuation of IOs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, Doral announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission had approved a
final settlement with Doral, which resolved the SEC&#146;s investigation of Doral. Doral has also stated
that the U.S. Attorney&#146;s Office for the Southern District of New York is conducting an
investigation of these matters. Actions have been brought by or on behalf of securities holders of
Doral in relation to these matters. In April&nbsp;2007, Doral agreed to a settlement in which Doral and
its insurers agreed to pay an aggregate of $129&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Estimates of Value Provided by Popular Securities. </I></B>Between October&nbsp;2002 and December&nbsp;2004,
Popular Securities, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, provided quarterly
estimates of the value of portfolios of IOs on behalf of Doral. In accordance with its
understanding regarding the engagement, in providing those estimates of value, Popular Securities
utilized assumptions provided by Doral that may not have been consistent with the actual terms of
the IO portfolios. As originally filed on March&nbsp;15, 2005, Doral&#146;s Form 10-K for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 stated that &#147;to determine the fair value of its IO portfolio&#148;, Doral engaged a
&#147;party&#148; to provide an &#147;external valuation&#148; that &#147;consists of a cash flow valuation model in which
all economic and portfolio assumptions are determined by the preparer&#148;. Popular Securities believes
that this characterization is not appropriate if it was meant to apply to Popular Securities&#146; work.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Amended Doral 2004 10-K, Doral stated that counsel for its Audit Committee and
independent directors had investigated the process it used to obtain &#147;third-party IO valuations&#148;,
that the investigation had concluded that the process &#147;was flawed&#148;, that Doral representatives &#147;may
have improperly provided inaccurate information&#148; concerning the IO portfolio to the parties
performing the third-party valuation, and that the counsel conducting the investigation had
&#147;limited access to the third parties who performed the IO valuation.&#148; The Corporation believes that
Doral considers Popular Securities to be one of the parties that provided Doral with &#147;third-party
IO valuations.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Transactions with Doral Relating to Mortgage Loans and IOs. </I></B>Between 1996 and 2004, BPPR
purchased mortgage loans from Doral for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.6&nbsp;billion.
The remaining balance of these mortgage loans recorded on the Corporation&#146;s consolidated statement
of condition at December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $323&nbsp;million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first six months of 2000, the Corporation sold mortgage loans to Doral Bank, a
subsidiary of Doral, in two transactions, each for an aggregate sale price of $100&nbsp;million, and
entered into two agreements, contemporaneously with the sale agreements, to purchase mortgage loans
from Doral, each for an aggregate purchase price of $100&nbsp;million. The Corporation recorded a gain
of $2.2&nbsp;million in the first quarter of 2000 and of $1.9&nbsp;million in the second quarter of 2000 from
the sales of mortgages to Doral Bank.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchases of mortgage loans from Doral for an aggregate price of $1.6&nbsp;billion were often
accompanied by separate recourse and other financial arrangements. The sale of mortgages to Doral
Bank for an aggregate purchase price of $200&nbsp;million was accompanied by separate recourse
arrangements.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;15, 2005, Doral announced that it was reversing &#147;a number of transactions
involving the generally contemporaneous purchase and sale of mortgage loans from and to local
financial institutions,&#148; including &#147;transactions covering the purchase and sale of approximately
$200&nbsp;million in mortgages with a local financial institution during 2000&#148; because Doral&#146;s Audit
Committee determined that there was &#147;insufficient contemporaneous documentation regarding the
business purpose for these transactions in light of the timing and similarity of the purchase and
sale amounts and the other terms of the transactions.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the December&nbsp;15, 2005 release, Doral stated that it was treating the sales of mortgage
loans by it as &#147;loans payable secured by mortgage loans.&#148; The Corporation believes that the
contemporaneous purchases and sales of mortgage loans entered into by the Corporation were the ones
reversed by Doral.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation has reviewed the foregoing mortgage loan purchase and sale transactions, as
well as the public statements by Doral, and believes that the transactions qualify for sale (or in
the case of purchases, purchase) treatment under the financial accounting standard at that time.
Accordingly, it has not reversed any of these transactions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1996 and 2004, the Corporation purchased IOs from Doral for an aggregate purchase
price of $110&nbsp;million. Over the same period Doral repurchased IOs it had previously sold to the
Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $54&nbsp;million. The remaining balance of these IOs
recorded on the Corporation&#146;s consolidated statement of condition at December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $32
million. These IOs have been reclassified from investments available-for-sale to loans to Doral
because they are accompanied by 100% guarantees from Doral of the principal and the fixed yield and
because of the source of the cash flow for payments on the IOs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Amended Doral 2004 10-K, Doral stated that Doral had &#147;failed to detect, document and
communicate certain side agreements entered into by Doral&#146;s former treasurer guaranteeing a fixed
yield to a purchaser&#148; of its IOs and that this failure &#147;resulted in the improper accounting for
these transactions as sales and the associated improper recognition of gains on sales.&#148; Doral
stated that it reversed the sales of the IOs and recorded the transaction as a secured borrowing.
It also stated that &#147;gains on sales of trading securities&#148; accounted for at the time of the sales
of the IOs were reversed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Transactions with R&#038;G Financial Corporation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>R&#038;G Announcements. </I></B>In April&nbsp;2005, R&#038;G Financial Corporation (&#147;R&#038;G&#148;) announced that its
previously filed financial statements for periods from January&nbsp;1, 2003 through December&nbsp;31, 2004
needed to be restated and should no longer be relied upon because of issues relating to the
methodology used in valuing its portfolio of residual interests retained in certain mortgage loan
transfers. In July&nbsp;2005, R&#038;G further announced that its previously filed financial statements for
period from January&nbsp;1, 2002 through December&nbsp;31, 2002 needed to be restated and should no longer be
relied upon. On November&nbsp;2, 2007, R&#038;G filed a Form 10-K/A (Amendment No.&nbsp;1) for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2004 (the &#147;Amended R&#038;G 2004 10-K&#148;). In the Amended R&#038;G 2004 10-K, R&#038;G stated that it
was reducing its retained earnings and capital reserves through December&nbsp;31, 2004 by $345&nbsp;million
on a pre-tax basis and that $237&nbsp;million of the $345&nbsp;million reduction was attributable to
recharacterization of certain mortgage loan transfers as secured borrowings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2008, R&#038;G announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission had approved a
final settlement with R&#038;G, which resolved the SEC&#146;s investigation of R&#038;G . R&#038;G has announced that
the U.S. Attorney&#146;s Office for the Southern District of New York is also conducting an informal
inquiry into these matters. Actions have been brought by or on behalf of securities holders of R&#038;G
in relation to these matters.

mortgage loan purchase transactions with R&#038;G in the amount of $176&nbsp;million. These mortgage loan
purchase transactions had recourse provisions and other financial arrangements. In the Amended R&#038;G
2004 10-K, R&#038;G disclosed that it had determined, after a review of all of its transactions that it
had previously characterized as mortgage loan sales, to recharacterize certain of those transactions as secured

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation faces a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent to our businesses,
including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal and regulatory risks. The following are
some of the more important factors that could affect our businesses.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Weakness in the economy and in the real estate market in the geographic footprint of Popular has
adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact Popular.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in
Puerto Rico (the &#147;Island&#148;) and the Island&#146;s economy has been deteriorating.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decline in the Island&#146;s economy has resulted in, among other things, a downturn in our
loan originations, an increase in the level of our non-performing assets and loan loss provisions,
particularly in our construction loan portfolio, an increase in the rate of foreclosure loss on
mortgage loans and a reduction in the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio, all of which
have adversely affected our profitability. If the decline in economic activity continues, there
could be further adverse effects on our profitability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government is currently facing a fiscal deficit which has been estimated at
approximately $3.0&nbsp;billion or over 30% of its annual budget. It is currently reviewing alternatives
for reducing the deficit, as its access to the municipal bond market and its credit ratings depend,
in part, on achieving a balanced budget. Measures that the government may implement could include
reducing expenses, including public-sector employment. Since the government is an important source
of employment on the Island, theses measures could have the effect of
intensifying the current recessionary cycle.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economy of Puerto Rico is sensitive to the price of oil in the global market. The Island
does not have significant mass transit available to the public and most of its electricity is
powered by oil, making it highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. A substantial increase in
its price could impact adversely the economy of Puerto Rico, by reducing disposable income and
increasing the operating costs of most businesses and government. Consumer spending is particularly
sensitive to wide fluctuations in oil prices.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of real estate prices in Puerto Rico has been more stable than in other U.S.
markets, but the current economic environment and future developments
in Puerto Rico and the mainland U.S. could further pressure
residential property values. Lower real estate values could increase loan delinquencies, foreclosures and the cost of
repossessing and disposing of real estate collateral.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current state of the economy and uncertainty in the private and public sectors has had an
adverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios. The continuation of the economic
slowdown would cause those adverse effects to continue, as delinquency rates may increase in the
short-term, until

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">sustainable growth resumes. Also, a potential reduction in consumer spending
may also impact growth in our other interest and non-interest revenue sources.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than
18&nbsp;months. In recent months, the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels. The
markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit
availability for almost all issuers, often without regard to those issuers&#146; underlying financial strength. If current levels of
market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that the Corporation
will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on its ability to access capital and
on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High levels of market volatility could impact adversely the pricing of the Corporation&#146;s
assets. As part of our business, the Corporation sells financial assets in the capital markets to
raise liquidity and manage its risk position. High amounts of volatility increase the probability
that assets may be disposed of at a loss or at a lower gain than anticipated. Also, part of the
valuation of the Corporation&#146;s financial assets is recognized in its financial statements and as
market conditions become more volatile, its earnings and capital could be adversely impacted.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation raises part of its liquidity in the capital markets. When market conditions
are unsettled, providers of liquidity become more risk averse and less willing to assume risk with
counterparties. Thereby, periods of high market volatility could make it more difficult and more
costly to raise financing, impacting our financial results.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Current
market developments have adversely affected the Corporation&#146;s industry, business and results of operations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dramatic declines in the housing market, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures
and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial
institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks,
and also in sales of those assets at significantly discounted prices. These write-downs, initially
of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities
have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and
stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of the
financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional
investors have reduced, and in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers including other
financial institutions. The resulting lack of available credit, lack of confidence in the financial
sector, increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity materially
and adversely affect the Corporation&#146;s business, financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline in housing prices in the U.S. has affected the Corporation&#146;s credit costs substantially as
delinquencies, and foreclosures have increased, together with the costs related to these. Losses
related to the decline in housing values have increased at the Corporation due to credit losses and
losses in the sale of foreclosed assets. The Corporation still have loan portfolios exposed to the U.S.
housing sector and most market participants expect the housing sector to remain under pressure
until after the end of 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent
market developments have changed the way in which the Corporation
finance its operations and have
impacted its funding flexibility. The availability of borrowed funds, particularly short-term
funds, has decreased substantially and its cost has risen markedly. The Corporation has reduced the
amount of funds it borrows in favor of increasing deposits and longer-term sources of capital such
as senior debt and preferred stock. Future developments may reduce
funding options available to the Corporation
and may increase the cost of raising financing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>The
soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the
Corporation.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,
counterparty, or other relationships. The Corporation has exposure to many different industries and
counterparties, and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services
industry, including brokers and dealers,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">commercial
banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Corporation to credit risk in the
event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, the Corporation credit risk may be exacerbated
when the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to
recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to the Corporation.
There can be no assurance that any
such losses would not materially and adversely affect its results of operations or earnings.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation has procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a
default among its
counterparties. The Corporation requests collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions
and monitor these on a regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of
collateral held by the Corporation and results in losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when market
confidence is affected by events related to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion among
participants increases substantially and makes it more difficult to borrow in the credit markets.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>A prolonged economic slowdown, a continuing decline in the real estate market in the U.S. mainland,
and ongoing disruptions in the capital markets have harmed and could continue to harm the results
of operations of Popular, Inc.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying
periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and
industry-wide losses. &#147;Bust&#148; cycles in the housing sector affect the Corporation&#146;s business by decreasing the
volume of loans originated and increasing the level of credit losses related to its mortgage loans.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housing market in the U.S. is undergoing a correction of historic proportions. After a
period of many years of booming housing markets, fueled by liberal credit conditions and rapidly
rising property values, since early 2007 the sector has been in the midst of a substantial
dislocation. This dislocation has had a significant impact on some of
the Corporation&#146;s U.S.-based business
segments and has affected its ongoing financial results and condition. The general
level of property values in the U.S., as measured by several indices widely followed by the market,
has declined significantly. These declines are the result of ongoing market adjustments that are aligning
property values with income levels and home inventories. The supply of homes in the market has
increased substantially, and additional property value decreases may be required to clear the
overhang of excess inventory in the U.S. market. Declining property values could impact the credit
quality of  the Corporation&#146;s U.S. mortgage loan portfolio because the value of the homes underlying the loans is
a primary source of repayment in the event of foreclosure. In the event of
foreclosure in a loan from this portfolio, the current market value
of the underlying collateral could be insufficient to cover the loan amount owed.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any sustained period of
increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses harms the
Corporation&#146;s  ability
to sell loans, the prices it receives for loans sold, and the values of its mortgage loans
held-for-sale. In addition, any material decline in real estate values would weaken the Corporation&#146;s collateral
loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. In such event, the Corporation
will be subject to the risk of loss on such mortgage assets arising from borrower defaults.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation maintains exposure in its U.S. loan portfolio to the housing sector. As of December&nbsp;31,
2008, the Corporation had $4.6&nbsp;billion in residential mortgage loans in portfolio, of which $1.7
billion was located in the continental
U.S. Further housing value declines in the U.S. could impact the level of losses in this portfolio.
Also, the Corporation has exposure to individuals in the form of home equity loans (home equity lines of credit
or &#147;HELOCs&#148;), which because of declining home values have become in effect unsecured consumer loans. This portfolio is sensitive to the
economic cycle in the U.S., and a further deterioration of the economy and employment conditions in
the mainland could affect the level of losses from this exposure. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008 the
Corporation had $573&nbsp;million in HELOCs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Financial results are constantly exposed to market risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market risk refers to the probability of variations in the net interest income or the market
value of assets and liabilities due to interest rate volatility. Despite the varied nature of
market risks, the primary source of this risk to us is the impact of changes in interest rates on
net interest income.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated on earning assets and the
interest cost of funding those assets. Depending on the duration and repricing characteristics of
the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, changes in interest rates could either
increase or decrease the level of net interest income. For any given period, the pricing structure
of the assets and liabilities is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature
or reprice in that period. Any mismatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities
is known as a gap position. A positive gap denotes asset sensitivity, which means that an increase
in interest rates could have a positive effect on net interest income, while a decrease in interest
rates could have a negative effect on net interest income. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Corporation
had a positive gap position.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target rate between
400 and 425 basis points from December&nbsp;31, 2007 to December&nbsp;31, 2008. The Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve has also expressed concerns about a variety of economic conditions, as well as
possible further reductions of interest rates in future periods. Many of the Corporation&#146;s
commercial loans are variable-rate and, accordingly, rate decreases may result in lower interest
income to Popular in the near term; however, depositors will continue to expect reasonable rates of
interest on their accounts, potentially compressing net interest margins further. The future
outlook on interest rates and their impact on Popular&#146;s interest income, interest expense and net
interest income is uncertain.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation usually runs its net interest income simulations under interest rate scenarios
in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline gradually by the same amount,
usually 200 basis points. Given the fact that as of year-end 2008, some short-term rates were close to zero
and some term interest rates were below 2.0%, management has decided to focus measuring the risk of net interest income in rising rate scenarios. The rising rate scenarios used were gradual parallel
changes of 200 and 400 basis points during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2009. Projected net interest income under the 200 basis points scenario rising rate scenario increased by $50.9 million while the 400 basis points
simulation increased by $90.8 million. These scenarios were compared against the Corporation&#146; flat interest rates forecast.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market disruptions discussed in other sections has led the Corporation to reduce substantially
its use of unsecured short-term borrowings. They have been largely replaced with deposits and
longer-term secured borrowings, and to a lesser extent, longer-term unsecured debt. Therefore, the
cost of the liabilities of the Corporation does not respond as quickly to changes in the levels of
interest rates. The Corporation&#146;s Asset Liability Management Committee (&#147;ALCO&#148;) committee regularly reviews the Corporation&#146;s interest rate
risk and initiates any action necessary to maintain its potential volatility within limits.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The hedging transactions that the Corporation enters into may not be effective in managing the
exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation uses derivatives, to a limited extent, to manage part of the exposure to
market risk caused by changes in interest rates or basis risk. The derivative instruments that the
Corporation may utilize also have their own risks, which include: (1)&nbsp;basis risk, which is the risk
of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and/or hedge
cost; (2)&nbsp;credit or default risk, which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the
counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations there under; and (3)&nbsp;legal
risk, which is the risk that the Corporation is unable to enforce certain terms of such
instruments. All or any of such risks could expose the Corporation to losses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher
market volatility in the capital markets could impact the performance of the Corporation&#146;s hedging
transactions. Most hedging activity is related to protecting the market value of mortgage loans
that are segregated for future sale and derivatives positions to hedge the cost of liabilities
issued or derivative positions with banking clients.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit
ratings are an important component of the Corporation&#146;s liquidity profile. Among other factors,
credit ratings are based on the financial strength, the credit quality of and concentrations in its
loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of management,
the liquidity of its balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core retail and
commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2009, Moody&#146;s Investor Service (&#147;Moody&#146;s&#148;) downgraded by one notch to &#147;Baa1&#148; the Corporation&#146;s
senior debt rating and by one notch its preferred stock rating to &#147;Baa3&#148;. The lead bank, Banco
Popular, is rated &#147;C&#043;&#148; for bank financial strength and &#147;A2&#148; for long-term deposits. The outlook is
negative. Moody&#146;s report indicated that the downgrade of Popular&#146;s ratings was prompted by the
deterioration in the Corporation&#146;s asset quality and profitability in 2008, and the prospect of
continuing weakness in these metrics in 2009. Such weakness could further undermine Popular&#146;s ratio
of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, which the rating agency indicated was
comparatively weak. Moody&#146;s believes that the deepening of the recession in the U.S. and the
continuation of the recession in Puerto Rico, will most likely cause Popular&#146;s asset quality
indicators, and hence its profitability, to remain pressured through 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fitch Ratings reduced the Corporation&#146;s ratings in January 2009 as follows: the senior debt
rating was cut two notches to &#147;BBB&#148;, the preferred stock rating was cut three notches to &#147;BB&#043;&#148; and
the short-term rating was maintained at &#147;F2&#148;. The outlook is negative. Fitch indicated the
continued credit quality deterioration and the expectations for ongoing pressure in the real estate
loan portfolios as the principal factors considered in the downgrade given recent trends in core
operating performance and the difficult outlook.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2009, Standard and Poor&#146;s revised the Corporation&#146;s ratings as follows: the senior
debt rating was cut by two notches to &#147;BBB-&#148;, the preferred stock rating was decreased by two
notches to &#147;BB&#148; and the short-term rating was cut to &#147;A3&#148;. The outlook is stable. S&#038;P indicated
that the rating action resulted from several factors, including among the principal ones the
Corporation&#146;s reported net operating losses, a continued deterioration in credit quality, and an
expected decline in capital ratios. S&#038;P is also concerned by the increase in nonperforming assets
and the potential for further deterioration, notably in the construction, mortgage, and commercial loan portfolios, as they see continued pressure on home
prices and reduced sale activity. S&#038;P views capital as adequate, but foresee more downward pressure
in 2009.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes
in the Corporation&#146;s credit ratings or the credit ratings of any of its subsidiaries to a level
below &#147;investment grade&#148; would adversely affect its ability to raise funds in the capital markets
and adversely affect its cost of funds and related margins and
liquidity. The Corporation&#146;s counterparties are
also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Corporation had $350&nbsp;million in senior debt issued by the bank holding
companies with interest that adjusts in the event of senior debt ratings downgrades. As a result of
the actions taken by the ratings agencies in 2009, the cost of that debt increased by 50 basis
points, which would represent an increase in the yearly interest expense of approximately $1.75
million.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior debt ratings downgrades summarized above will make it more difficult and costly to
raise unsecured senior debt in the capital market. Although the Corporation continues to be investment grade, the
liquidity of the capital market for senior bank debt continues impaired for all but the most highly
rated and well known financials.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously mentioned, among the recent federal government programs announced in late 2008
to assist the banking industry, the TLGP permits bank holding companies and banks to issue senior
debt under certain conditions, with a guarantee by the FDIC. In addition, the TLGP provides an FDIC
guarantee on non-interest bearing transaction accounts with no limit until December&nbsp;31, 2009. The
Corporation has enrolled in both programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s preferred stock rating is currently &#147;non-investment&#148; grade under two rating
agencies. The market for non investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for
investment grade securities. Therefore, if the Corporation were to attempt to issue preferred stock
in the capital markets, it is possible that there not be sufficient demand to complete a
transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Popular&#146;s ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits depends on various
factors, including service, convenience and financial stability as reflected by the operating
results and credit ratings by nationally recognized credit agencies. Our ratings are subject to
change at any time at the sole discretion of the rating agencies without previous notice. A
downgrade in credit ratings may impact the ability to raise deposits, but we believe that the
impact should not be material. Deposits at all of the Corporation&#146;s banking subsidiaries are federally insured
(subject to limitations established by the FDIC), which together with the TLGP, is expected to
mitigate the effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with
respect to the loans originated or acquired. The Corporation establishes provisions for loan
losses, which lead to reductions in the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance
for loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an
assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures and
guidelines. This process, which is critical to the Corporation&#146;s financial results and condition, requires
difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic and
market conditions that might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay the loans. There can be
no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future loan losses or that the
Corporation will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in the future as a result of

commercial loans portfolios.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation has a significant portfolio in construction and commercial loans, mostly
secured by commercial and residential real estate properties. Due to their nature, these loans entail a higher credit risk
than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, concentrate more risk in a single
borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. Rapidly changing collateral
values, general economic conditions and numerous other factors continue to create volatility in the
housing markets and have increased the possibility that additional losses may have to be recognized
with respect to the Corporation&#146;s current nonperforming assets. Furthermore, given the current
slowdown in the real estate market, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose
of, if foreclosed.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are
greatly dependent upon the condition of the real estate market in which the collateral is located.
Recent economic reports indicate that real estate market values have been declining mainly due to
the experienced decrease in the purchasing power of the consumers and the existing general economic
conditions. A significant decline in collateral valuations for collateral dependent loans may
require increases in the Corporation&#146;s provision for loan losses, which would have an adverse
effect on the future financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The Corporation operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes
in federal and local laws and regulations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and
Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal or Puerto Rico laws or
regulations could have a substantial impact on its operations. Additional laws and regulations may
be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect the Corporation&#146;s powers,
authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation&#146;s financial
condition and results of operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory
and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and
unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this
regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on the Corporation.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the Corporation&#146;s
profitability.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation faces substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits.
The competition in originating loans comes principally from other U.S., Puerto Rico and foreign
banks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and other
institutional lenders and purchasers of loans. Certain of the Corporation&#146;s competitors are not
subject to the same extensive regulation that governs the Corporation&#146;s business.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In, Puerto Rico, competition is primarily from other local depository institutions and from
the local operations of several global banks and major U.S. money center banks. As a group they
compete in all segments of the market and present a formidable source of competition for the
Corporation. Competition is particularly acute in the market for deposits, where pricing is very
aggressive.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.S., competition is primarily from community banks operating in the Corporation&#146;s footprint together
with the national banking institutions. These include institutions with much more resources than we
have and can exert substantial competitive pressure.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased competition could require that the Corporation increase the rates offered on
deposits or lower the rates charged on loans, which could adversely affect its profitability.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Puerto Rico&#146;s economy is closely integrated to that of the U.S. mainland and its
government and many of its instrumentalities are investment grade-rated borrowers in the U.S.
capital markets, the fiscal situation of the Government of Puerto Rico has led nationally recognized
rating agencies to downgrade its debt obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Government&#146;s fiscal challenges in 2006, Moodys and S&#038;P then downgraded the
rating of its obligations, but maintaining them within investment-grade levels. Since then, actions
by the Government have improved the credit outlook. As of December&nbsp;31, 2007, S&#038;P rated the
Government&#146;s general obligations at BBB-, while Moodys rated them at Baa3- both in the lowest notch
of investment grade. In November&nbsp;2007, Moody&#146;s upgraded the outlook of the Commonwealth&#146;s credit

progress the Commonwealth has made in addressing the fiscal challenges it has faced in recent
years. However, in the current fiscal year, the Commonwealth is confronting a substantial deficit
and is currently reviewing options to confront the problem. While Moody&#146;s &#147;Baa3&#148; rating and S&#038;P&#146;s

in government revenues continues for a longer time period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factors such as the government&#146;s ability to implement meaningful steps to curb operating
expenditures, improve managerial and budgetary controls, and eliminate the government&#146;s reliance on
operating budget loans from the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico will be key determinants
of future ratings stability. Also, the inability to agree on future fiscal year Commonwealth
budgets could result in ratings pressure from the rating agencies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is uncertain how the financial markets may react to any potential future ratings downgrade
in Puerto Rico&#146;s debt obligations. However, a deterioration in the fiscal situation with possible
negative ratings implications, could adversely affect the value of Puerto Rico&#146;s Government
obligations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Corporation had $1.0&nbsp;billion of credit facilities granted to or
guaranteed by the P.R. Government and its political subdivisions, of which $215&nbsp;million were
uncommitted lines of credit. Of these total credit facilities granted, $943&nbsp;million in loans were
outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2008. A substantial portion of the Corporation&#146;s credit exposure to the Government of Puerto Rico are
either collateralized loans or obligations that have a specific source of income or revenues
identified for its repayment. Some of these obligations consist of senior and subordinated loans to
public corporations that obtain revenues from rates charged for services or products, such as water
and electric power utilities. Public corporations have varying degrees of independence from the
Central Government and many receive appropriations or other payments from it. The Corporation also
has loans to various municipalities for which the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of
the applicable municipality has been pledged to their repayment. These municipalities are required
by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all
of its general obligation bonds and loans. Another portion of these loans consists of special
obligations of various municipalities that are payable from the basic real and personal property
taxes collected within such municipalities. The good faith and credit obligations of the
municipalities have a first lien on the basic property taxes.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 the Corporation had outstanding $386&nbsp;million in
Obligations of Puerto Rico, States and Political Subdivisions as part of its investment portfolio.
Of that total, $363&nbsp;million was exposed to the creditworthiness of the P.R. Government and its
municipalities. Of that portfolio, $47&nbsp;million was in the form of Puerto Rico Commonwealth&#146;s
Appropriation Bonds, which are currently rated Ba1, one notch below investment grade, by Moody&#146;s
and BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating, by S&#038;P. At December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Appropriation Bonds indicated above represented approximately
$3.2&nbsp;million in unrealized losses in the Corporation&#146;s portfolio of investment securities
available- for- sale. The Corporation is closely monitoring the political and economic situation of
the Island and evaluates the portfolio for any declines in value that management

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, the Corporation issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase its Common
Stock to the Treasury as part of its TARP Capital Purchase Program. The terms of the
preferred shares include, subject to certain exceptions, a restriction on paying dividends for both
preferred shares equal or junior to U.S. Treasury investment and common shares unless the
Corporation is current in the dividend payment to the Treasury. In addition, prior to December&nbsp;5,
2011, unless we have redeemed all of the preferred stock or the Treasury has transferred all
of the preferred stock to a third party, the consent of the Treasury will be required to the Corporation
to, among other things, increase its Common Stock dividend or repurchase its Common Stock or other
preferred stock (with certain exceptions, including the repurchase of
its Common Stock to offset
share dilution from equity-based employee compensation awards). The Corporation have also granted registration

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
time to time, the Corporation is audited by various federal, state and local authorities regarding
income tax matters. Significant judgment is required to determine the Corporation&#146;s provision for income taxes
and its liabilities for federal, state, local and other taxes. The Corporation&#146;s audits are in various stages of
completion; however, no outcome for a particular audit can be determined with certainty prior to
the conclusion of the audit, appeal and, in some cases, litigation
process. Although the Corporation believes its
approach to determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes,&#148; and FASB
Interpretation No.&nbsp;48, &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,&#148; it is possible that the final
tax authority will take a tax position that is materially different than that which is reflected in
the Corporation&#146;s income tax provision and other tax reserves. As each audit is conducted, adjustments, if any,
are appropriately recorded in its Consolidated Financial Statements in the period determined. Such
differences could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation&#146;s income tax provision or benefit, or other

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation&#146;s certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of
Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of
stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year
term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore,
control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings
must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. The
Corporation&#146;s certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of
Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two-thirds of
the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of
directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of
Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These
provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire the Corporation because
of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result,
may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital
stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for
the Corporation&#146;s capital stock.

impairment could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation&#146;s
financial condition and future results of operations</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation performed the annual goodwill impairment evaluation for
the entire organization during the third quarter of 2008 using
July&nbsp;31, 2008 as the annual evaluation date and performed an
interim goodwill impairment assessment as of December&nbsp;31, 2008
for BPNA. Based on the results of these analyses, management
concluded that there was no goodwill impairment as of these dates.
The fair value determination for each reporting unit performed to
determine if potential goodwill impairment exists requires
management to make estimates and assumptions. Critical assumptions
that are used as part of these evaluations include:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><B>&#149;</B>
</B>selection of comparable publicly traded companies, based on

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
validate the reasonableness of the results of the annual impairment
evaluation, management performed a reconciliation of the aggregate
fair values determined for the reporting units to the market
capitalization of the Corporation and concluded that the fair value
results determined for the reporting units in the annual test were
reasonable. It is possible that the assumptions and conclusions
regarding the valuation of the Corporation&#146;s reporting units
could change adversely and could result in the recognition of goodwill
impairment. Such impairment could have a material adverse effect on the
Corporation&#146;s future results of operations. As of December 31,
2008, the Corporation had approximately $606 million of goodwill
remaining on its balance sheet, of which $404 million was related to
BPNA. Declines in the Corporation&#146;s market capitalization
increase the risk of goodwill impairment in 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>The
Corporation&#146;s business could suffer if it is unable to attract,
retain and motivate skilled senior leaders</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation&#146;s success depends, in large part, on its ability to
retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders
can be intense in most areas of the Corporation&#146;s business. The
executive compensation provisions of the EESA, including amendments
to such provisions implemented under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009, are expected to limit the types of
compensation arrangements that the Corporation may enter into with
its most senior leaders upon adoption of implementing standards by
the Treasury. These standards, and any further legislation or
regulation restricting executive compensation, could have a negative
impact on the Corporation&#146;s ability to attract and retain
talented leaders in support of the Corporation&#146;s long term
strategy.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
May&nbsp;2008, the Corporation issued 16,000,000 shares of its 8.25% non-cumulative monthly income preferred stock,
2008 Series&nbsp;B at a purchase price of $25 per share. These shares of preferred stock are perpetual, nonconvertible and are redeemable, in
whole or in part, solely at the option of the Corporation with the consent of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System beginning on May&nbsp;28, 2013. The redemption price per share
is $25.50 from May&nbsp;28, 2013 through May&nbsp;28, 2014, $25.25 from May&nbsp;28, 2014 through May&nbsp;28, 2015 and
$25.00 from May&nbsp;28, 2015 and thereafter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;5, 2008, the Corporation entered into a Letter
Agreement with the Treasury pursuant to which the Treasury invested $935&nbsp;million in
preferred stock of Popular under Treasury&#146;s TARP Capital Purchase Program. Under the Agreement, the
Corporation agreed to issue and sell to the Treasury, (1)&nbsp;935,000 shares of Popular&#146;s Fixed Rate
Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series&nbsp;C, $1,000 liquidation preference per share and (2)&nbsp;a
warrant to purchase 20,932,836, shares of Popular&#146;s Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.70 per
share. The exercise price of the warrant was determined based upon the average of the closing
prices of Popular&#146;s Common Stock during the 20-trading day period ended November&nbsp;12, 2008, the last
trading day prior to the date Popular&#146;s application to participate in the program was preliminarily
approved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shares of Series&nbsp;C Preferred Stock qualify as Tier 1 regulatory capital and pay cumulative
dividends quarterly at a rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, and 9% per annum
thereafter. The Series&nbsp;C Preferred Stock is non-voting, other than class voting rights on certain
matters that could adversely affect the preferred shares. The Series&nbsp;C Preferred Stock may be
redeemed by Popular at par after December&nbsp;5, 2011. Prior to that date, the preferred shares may
only be redeemed by Popular at par in an amount up to the cash proceeds received by Popular
(minimum $233.75&nbsp;million) from qualifying equity offerings of any Tier 1 perpetual preferred or
Common Stock. Any redemption is subject to the consent of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System. Until December&nbsp;5, 2011, or such earlier time as all preferred shares have been
redeemed or transferred by the Treasury, Popular will not, without Treasury&#146;s consent, be able to
increase its dividend rate per share of Common Stock or repurchase
its Common Stock. The shares of Series&nbsp;C
Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar
provisions. Holders of Series&nbsp;C Preferred Stock will have no right to require redemption or
repurchase of any shares of Series&nbsp;C Preferred Stock. The Corporation&#146;s Common Stock ranks junior to Series&nbsp;C Preferred Stock as to
dividend rights and/or as to rights on liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation. The Corporation&#146;s participation
in the TARP Capital Purchase Program is also subject to
certain of the executive compensation limitations included in the
EESA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrant is immediately exercisable, subject to certain restrictions, and has a 10-year
term. The exercise price and number of shares subject to the warrant are both subject to
anti-dilution adjustments. Treasury may not exercise voting power with respect to shares of Common
Stock issued upon exercise of the warrant. If Popular receives aggregate gross cash proceeds of not
less than $935&nbsp;million from one or more qualifying equity offerings of Tier 1-eligible perpetual
preferred or Common Stock on or prior to December&nbsp;31, 2009, the number of shares of Common Stock
underlying the warrant then held by Treasury will be reduced by one half of the original number of
shares, taking into account all adjustments, underlying the warrant.
The Treasury and other future
holders of the preferred shares, the warrant or the Common Stock issued pursuant to the warrant
also have piggyback and demand registration rights with respect to the securities. Neither the
preferred shares nor the warrant nor the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant are subject
to any contractual restriction on transfer, except that the Treasury may only transfer or exercise an aggregate of one-half of the warrant shares prior to December&nbsp;31, 2009
unless Popular has received gross proceeds from qualified equity offerings that are at least equal
to the $935&nbsp;million initially received from the Treasury. The allocated carrying values of the Series&nbsp;C
Preferred Stock and the warrant on the date of issuance (based on the relative fair values) were
$896&nbsp;million and $39&nbsp;million, respectively.

on the amount of any dividends paid by corporations to individuals, whether residents of Puerto
Rico or not, trusts, estates and foreign corporations or partnerships not engaged in trade or
business within Puerto Rico at a preferential 10% withholding tax rate. If the recipient is a
foreign corporation or partnership engaged in trade or business within Puerto Rico or a domestic
corporation the dividend will be taxed at regular rates but will be allowed an 85% dividend
received deduction.

preferential 10% tax will not be withheld from such year&#146;s distributions.

    <TD>On November&nbsp;3, 2008, the Corporation sold residual interests and servicing related
assets of PFH and Popular, FS to Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, Goldman, Sachs &#038; Co. and
Litton Loan Servicing, LP. In addition, on September&nbsp;18, 2008, the Corporation announced
the consummation of the sale of manufactured housing loans of PFH to 21st Mortgage Corp.
and Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc. The above transactions and past sales and
restructuring plans executed at PFH in the past two years have resulted in the
discontinuance of the Corporation&#146;s PFH operations and PFH&#146;s results are reflected as such
in the Corporation&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The computation of earnings to
fixed charges and preferred stock dividends excludes discontinued operations. Prior

taxes, plus fixed charges. Fixed charges represent all interest expense (ratios are presented both
excluding and including interest on deposits), the portion of net rental expense, which is deemed
representative of the interest factor and the amortization of debt issuance expense. The interest
expense includes changes in the fair value of the non-hedging derivatives.
