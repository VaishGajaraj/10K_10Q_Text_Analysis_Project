<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt"><B>CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain oral and written statements made by Aaron Rents, Inc. about future events and
expectations, including statements in this annual report on Form 10-K, are &#147;forward-looking
statements.&#148; For those statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking
statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
statements are based on management&#146;s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations regarding our
future economic performance, taking into account the information currently available to them.
Generally, the words &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; and
similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in
nature. All statements which address operating performance, events or developments that we expect
or anticipate will occur in the future, including growth in store openings, franchises awarded,
market share and statements expressing general optimism about future operating results, are
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company&#146;s historical
experience and the company&#146;s present expectations or projections. Factors that could cause our
actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements include changes in general
economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and those factors discussed in Item&nbsp;1A,
&#147;Risk Factors.&#148; We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these uncertainties and that such statements speak only as of the date made, you should
not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update
publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

rental return merchandise to individuals and businesses, with a focus on renting residential and
office furniture to business customers. We have been in the corporate furnishings business

largest corporate furnishings rental company in the United States.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business customers, who represent an increasing portion of rental customers, rent residential

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>The Rent-to-Own Industry</I>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent-to-own industry offers customers an alternative to traditional methods of obtaining
electronics, computers, home furnishings and appliances. In a typical rent-to-own transaction, the
customer has the option to acquire merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 to 24&nbsp;months, normally
by making weekly rental payments. The customer may cancel the agreement at any time by returning
the merchandise to the store, with no further rental obligation. If the customer rents the item to
the full term, he obtains ownership of the item, though he can choose to buy it at any time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent-to-own concept is particularly popular with consumers who cannot pay the full
purchase price for merchandise at once or who lack the credit to qualify under conventional
financing programs. Rent-to-own is also popular with consumers who, despite good credit, do not
wish to incur additional debt, have only a temporary need for the merchandise or want to try out a
particular brand or model before buying it.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the decline in the number of furniture stores and the limited number of
retailers that focus on credit installment sales to lower and middle income consumers has created a
market opportunity for our unique sales and lease ownership concept. The traditional retail
consumer durable goods market is much larger than the rental market, leaving substantial potential
for growth for our sales and lease ownership division. We believe that the segment of the
population targeted by our sales and lease ownership division comprises approximately 50% of all
households in the United States and that the needs of these consumers are generally underserved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership versus Traditional Rent-to-Own</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our sales and lease ownership model is unique. By providing customers with the
option either to lease merchandise with the opportunity to obtain ownership or to purchase
merchandise outright, we blend elements of rent-to-own and traditional retailing. We enable cash or
credit-constrained customers to obtain quality-of-life enhancing merchandise that they otherwise
might not be able to afford without incurring additional debt or long-term obligations. In addition
to these core customers, our concept is also

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">popular with consumers who have only a temporary need for the merchandise or want to try out a
particular brand or model before purchase. We believe our sales and lease ownership program is a
more effective method of retailing our merchandise to lower to middle income consumers than a
typical rent-to-own business or the more traditional method of credit installment sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales and lease ownership model is also distinctive from a typical rent-to-own business in
that we encourage our customers to obtain ownership of their rental merchandise. Based on industry
data, we believe that more of the initial renters of our merchandise (over 45%) obtain ownership
versus rent-to-own businesses in general (approximately 25%). We believe our sales and lease
ownership model offers the following unique characteristics versus traditional rent-to-own stores:

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe our sales and lease ownership model also has attractive features in common with
traditional retailers. Among these features are store size, merchandise selection and the latest
product offerings, such as &#147;state-of-the-art&#148; electronics and computers. As technology has advanced
and home furnishings and appliances have evolved, we have strived to offer our customers the latest
product developments at affordable prices. Although the categories of products we offer have
remained substantially the same over the years, we have experienced a percentage increase in
revenues from electronics and computers in our sales and lease ownership division as compared to
total revenues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, our sales and lease ownership stores offer an up-front &#147;cash and carry&#148; purchase
option on select merchandise at prices that are competitive with discount and traditional
retailers. However, unlike transactions with most traditional retailers, where the customer is
committed to purchase the merchandise, our sales and lease ownership transactions are not credit
installment contracts, and the customer may elect to terminate the transaction after a short
initial rental period.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for rental products is believed to be related to the mobility of the population,
which relies upon rented merchandise to meet temporary needs. The industry is highly competitive
and has consolidated, with only a handful of companies accounting for a substantial share of the
market.

Additional stores help us to realize economies of scale in purchasing, marketing and

comparing revenues from comparable periods for all stores open during the entirety of

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Sales and Lease Ownership</I>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We established our Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership operation in 1987. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, we
had 845 company-operated sales and lease ownership stores in 47 states and Canada.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed a distinctive concept for our sales and lease ownership stores with specific
merchandising, store layout, pricing, and agreement terms for our target customer market. We
believe that these features create a store and a sales and lease ownership concept significantly
different from the operations of rent-to-own stores, our traditional corporate furnishings
(rent-to-rent) business, and the operations of consumer electronics and home furnishings retailers
who finance merchandise.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The typical Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership store layout is a combination showroom and
warehouse of 8,000 to 10,000 square feet, with an average of approximately 9,000 total square feet.
In selecting locations for new sales and lease ownership stores, we generally look for sites in
well-maintained strip shopping centers with good access, which are strategically located in
established working class neighborhoods and communities. We also build to suit or occupy stand
alone stores in certain markets.
Many of our stores are placed near existing competitors&#146; stores. Each sales and lease ownership
store usually maintains at least two trucks and crews for pickups and deliveries and generally
offers same or next day delivery for addresses located within ten miles of the store. We emphasize
a broad selection of brand name electronics, computers and appliances, and offer customers a wide
selection of furniture, including furniture manufactured by our MacTavish Furniture Industries
division. Our sales and lease ownership stores also offer lawn tractors and jewelry.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our sales and lease ownership stores offer lower merchandise prices than
similar items offered by traditional rent-to-own operators, and substantially equivalent to the
&#147;all-in&#148; contract price of similar items offered by retailers who finance merchandise.
Approximately 78% of our sales and lease ownership agreements are monthly and approximately 22% are
semi-monthly as compared to the industry standard of weekly agreements, and our agreements usually
provide for a shorter term leading to customer ownership. Customers can have the item serviced free
of charge or replaced at any time during the rental agreement. We re-rent or sell merchandise that
customers return to us prior to the expiration of their agreements. We also offer, for select
merchandise, an up-front cash and carry purchase option at prices that are competitive with
discount and traditional retailers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the later part of 2004, we opened two experimental stores under the RIMCO name that
lease automobile tires and rims to customers under sales and lease ownership agreements. Although
the products offered are different, these stores are managed, monitored and operated similar to our
other sales and lease ownership stores. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, we had 17 RIMCO stores open and
expect to expand this business during 2007 by opening additional company-operated stores as well as
several franchised stores.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Sales and Lease Ownership Franchise Program</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We began franchising Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership stores in select markets in 1992 and have
continued to attract franchisees. Our franchised stores do not compete with company-operated
stores, nor do we anticipate any such competition, as we mainly award franchises in markets where
we have no operations and no current plans to enter. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, we had 441 franchised
stores open and area development agreements with franchisees to open 233 stores in the future. We
believe that our relations with our franchisees are generally good.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant&#146;s business background and financial
resources. We generally seek franchisees who will enter into area development agreements for
several stores, although many franchisees currently operate a single store. Most franchisees are
involved in the day-to-day operations of the stores.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enter into franchise agreements with our franchisees to govern the opening and operation of
franchised stores. Under our current standard agreement, we require the franchisee to pay a
franchise fee from $15,000 to $50,000 per store depending upon market size. Agreements are for a
term of ten years, with one ten-year renewal option, and franchisees are obligated to remit to us
royalty payments of 5% or 6% of the franchisee&#146;s weekly cash collections. The royalty payments
increased from 5% to 6% for all franchise agreements entered into or renewed after December&nbsp;31,
2002.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We assist each franchisee in selecting the proper site for each store. Because of the
importance of location to the Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership concept, one of our pre-opening
directors visits the intended market and helps guide the franchisee through the selection process.
Once a site is selected, we help in designing the floor plan, including the proper layout of the
showroom and warehouse. In addition, we provide assistance in assuring that the design and decor of
the showroom is consistent with our requirements. We also lease the exterior signage to the
franchisee and assist with placing pre-opening advertising, ordering initial inventory and
obtaining delivery vehicles.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an arrangement with several banks to provide financing to qualifying franchisees to
assist with establishing and operating their stores. An inventory financing plan to provide
franchisees with the capital
to purchase inventory is the primary component of the financing program. For qualified established
franchisees, we have arranged in some cases for these institutions to provide a revolving credit
line to allow franchisees the flexibility to expand. We guarantee amounts outstanding under the
franchisee financing programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All franchisees are required to complete a comprehensive training program and to operate their
franchised sales and lease ownership stores in compliance with our policies, standards and
specifications,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">including such matters as decor, rental agreement terms, hours of operation,
pricing and merchandise. Franchisees in general are not required to purchase their rental
merchandise from our fulfillment centers, although most do so in order to take advantage of company
sponsored financing, bulk purchasing discounts and favorable delivery terms. Several franchisees
also purchase their rental furniture directly from our MacTavish Furniture Industries division.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conduct a financial audit of our franchised stores every six to 12&nbsp;months and also conduct
regular operational audits &#151; generally visiting each franchised store almost as often as we visit
our company-operated stores. In addition, our proprietary management information system links each
franchised store to corporate headquarters.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Corporate Furnishings</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been in the rent-to-rent business for over 50&nbsp;years and believe we are the second
largest corporate furnishings rental company in the United States. Our corporate furnishings
business accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues in 2006. We rent new and rental
return merchandise to both individuals and businesses, with a growing focus on renting residential
and office furniture to business customers. As of December&nbsp;31, 2006, we operated 59 corporate
furnishings stores in 16 states.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our typical corporate furnishings store layout consists of a combination showroom and
warehouse comprising about 19,000 square feet. Each residential showroom features attractive
displays of living room, dining room and bedroom furniture in a number of styles, fabrics,
materials and colors. Office rental showrooms feature lines of desks, chairs, conference tables,
credenzas, sofas and accessories. We believe that locating a warehouse next to each showroom
permits store managers to exercise greater control over inventory, merchandise condition, and
pickup and deliveries, resulting in more efficient and consistent service for the customer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items held for rent, whether new or rental return, are available for purchase and lease
purchase at all corporate furnishings stores. Each corporate furnishings store generally offers
next day delivery for addresses located within 50 miles of the store and maintains at least one
truck and a crew for pickups and deliveries. We believe that our ability to obtain and deliver
furniture and equipment to customers quickly and efficiently gives us an advantage over general
furniture retailers who often require several weeks to effect delivery.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We generally sell rental return merchandise at stores at or above its book value, that is,
cost less depreciation, plus selling expenses, at a price which is usually lower than the price for
comparable new merchandise. Most merchandise held for sale in stores may also be acquired through a
lease purchase option. Because new merchandise is sold at the same location as rental return
merchandise, we have the opportunity to sell both new and rental return merchandise to customers
who may have been attracted to the store by the advertising and price appeal of rental return
merchandise. The ability to sell new and rental return merchandise at the same location allows for
more efficient use of facilities and personnel and minimizes overhead.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><I>Furniture Manufacturing</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our MacTavish Furniture Industries division has manufactured furniture for our stores since
1971. The division has seven furniture manufacturing plants, five bedding manufacturing facilities,
and one lamp manufacturing facilities, totaling approximately 817,000 square feet in the aggregate, that supply
nearly one-half of our furniture and accessories. We believe our manufacturing plants have the
capacity to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing are fabric, foam, fiber,

materials we use are in short supply.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our sales and lease ownership operations, we rely heavily on national and local television
advertising, direct mail, and direct delivery of promotional materials. We focus our national
television advertising on a variety of commercials. All of the television commercials feature name
brand merchandise including HDTV wide screen televisions, computers, stainless steel
refrigerators, washers and dryers, and lawn tractors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have garnered significant value from our sports marketing initiatives. We advertise and
sponsor motorsports at various levels and collegiate and professional sports, such as NBA, WWE,
AFL, SEC and ACC football and basketball and major league baseball, among others.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
premier event partnership continues to be the Aaron&#146;s Dream Weekend
at Talladega Superspeedway consisting of the Aaron&#146;s 499 NASCAR
Nextel Cup Series Race and the Aaron&#146;s 312 NASCAR Busch Series Race.
Both races are broadcast live on ABC/ESPN television and are among
the most watched NASCAR events.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have continued our sponsorship of Michael Waltrip Racing with
David Reutimann driving the #99 Aaron&#146;s Dream Machine in the Busch
Series, and an Aaron&#146;s Lucky Dog truck in the Craftsman Truck Series,
and a #99 Aaron&#146;s Dream Machine in the Hooters Pro Cup Series.</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we sponsor the Arena Football League, which is broadcast nationally on
ABC/ESPN and regionally on Fox Sports Net and the Outdoor Life Network. This sponsorship includes
uniform patches on all visiting teams&#146; jerseys, arena signage and local promotions throughout the
country. National in-store sweepstakes for a trip for two to the ArenaBowl in New Orleans helps
drive these arena football fans into Aaron&#146;s locations around the country. Fans also vote online
for their favorite dancer for the Aaron&#146;s AFL Dream Team, who performs annually at the Aaron&#146;s
Talladega Dream Weekend and at the Arena Bowl.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sports partnerships are integrated into advertising, promotional and marketing
initiatives, which we believe significantly boosts the company&#146;s brand awareness and customer
loyalty.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron&#146;s in-house advertising and promotions department distributes over 20&nbsp;million direct
circulars each month which highlight featured merchandise and demonstrate the cost advantage to
consumers of sales and lease ownership rather than rent-to-own.

corporate customers. In addition, the division has a national accounts program that develops
strategic partnerships to service clients&#146; nationwide needs. As an example, the corporate
furnishings division has developed an alliance with a larger trailer company to handle all of the
short term furnishings for trailers used at NASCAR races and has been a sponsor in the Tour de

audits of company-operated sales and lease ownership stores several times each year, and
semi-annual audits of corporate furnishings stores and franchised sales and lease ownership stores.
Our business philosophy has always emphasized safeguarding of company assets, strict cost
containment and fiscal controls. Executive and store level management monitor expenses to contain
costs. We pay all invoices from company headquarters in order to enhance fiscal accountability.
We believe that careful attention to the safeguarding of rental merchandise, our most significant
asset, as well as expense side of our operations has enabled us to maintain financial stability and
profitability.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Management Information Systems. </I></B>We use computer-based management information systems to facilitate
cash collections, merchandise returns and inventory monitoring. Through the use of proprietary
software developed in-house, each of our stores is linked by computer directly to corporate
headquarters, which enables us to monitor the performance of each store on a daily basis. At the
store level, the store manager is better able to track merchandise on the showroom floor and in the
warehouse to minimize delivery times, assist with product purchasing, and match customer needs with
available inventory. Different systems are used to run the sales and lease ownership and corporate
furnishings operations due to the significant differences in the businesses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Rental Agreement Approval, Renewal and Collection. </I></B>One of the keys to the success of our sales and
lease ownership operation is timely cash collections. Individual store managers use our
computerized information system on a daily basis to track cash collections. They contact customers
within a few days of when their lease payments are due in order to encourage customers to keep
their agreement current and in force, rather than having to return the merchandise for non-payment,
and to renew their agreements for an additional period. Careful attention to cash collections is
particularly important in the sales and lease ownership operations, where the customer typically
has the option to cancel the agreement at any time and each payment is considered a renewal of the
agreement rather than a collection of a receivable.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We generally perform no formal credit check with respect to sales and lease ownership
customers, other than to verify employment or other reliable sources of income and personal
references supplied by the customer. Each corporate furnishings store performs a credit check on
most of its residential and business customers. All of our agreements for residential and office
merchandise require payments in advance, and the merchandise normally is repossessed if a payment
is significantly in arrears.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net bad debt losses from corporate furnishings rentals as a percentage of corporate
furnishings rental revenues were approximately 0.6%, 1.1%, and 1.4%, for the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. We do not extend credit to sales and lease ownership
customers. For the same periods, net company-wide merchandise shrinkage as a percentage of
combined rental revenues was 2.1%, 2.6%, and 2.2%, respectively. We believe that our collection
and repossession policies comply with applicable legal requirements, and we discipline any employee
that we discover deviating from such policies.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Customer Service</I></B><I>. </I>We believe that customer service is one of the most important elements in the
success of our sales and lease ownership and corporate furnishings businesses. Customer
satisfaction is critical because the customer typically has the option of returning the rented
merchandise at any time. Our goal is to make our customers feel positive about Aaron Rents and our
products from the moment they enter our showrooms. Items are serviced at no charge to the
customer, and quick, free delivery is available in many cases. In order to increase rentals at
existing stores, we foster relationships with existing customers to attract recurring business, and
many new rental and lease ownership agreements are attributable to repeat customers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the importance of customer service, we believe that a prerequisite for successful
operations and growth is skilled, effective employees who value our customers and project a genuine
desire to serve customers&#146; needs. Our Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership division has 41 training
facilities where store managers and employees learn and review all areas of our operations, with a
heavy emphasis on customer service. We also have a training program we call Aaron&#146;s University
designed to provide a uniform customer service experience regardless of the store location, whether
company-operated or franchised. Standardizing operating procedures throughout our system is a
primary focus of Aaron&#146;s University. We have a 30-course curriculum for sales and lease ownership
managers. The corporate furnishings division&#146;s sales and management training programs have similar
training conducted at our Atlanta headquarters. Approximately once a month we distribute a DVD
entitled &#147;Inside Aaron&#146;s.&#148; These DVDs are intended to communicate a wide variety of topics of
interest to our store personnel regarding current company initiatives. Our policy of promoting
from within boosts employee retention and underscores our commitment to customer service and other
business philosophies, allowing us to realize greater benefits from our employee training programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our corporate furnishings division, furniture is the primary merchandise category,
accounting for approximately 94% of corporate furnishings revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We purchase the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers, with the balance from
local distributors. One of our largest suppliers is our own MacTavish Furniture Industries
division, which supplies nearly one-half of the furniture we rent or sell. We have no long-term
agreements for the purchase of merchandise and believe that our relationships with suppliers are
good.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales and lease ownership operations utilize fulfillment centers, which are on average
approximately 86,000 square feet, to control merchandise. All company-operated sales and lease
ownership stores receive merchandise directly from our 16 fulfillment centers together totaling
approximately 1,457,000 square feet. Most of our stores are within a 250-mile radius of a
fulfillment center, facilitating timely shipment of supplies to the stores and fast delivery of
orders to customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate furnishings stores receive merchandise directly from vendors who ship to the stores&#146;
attached warehouses. Sales and lease ownership stores typically have smaller warehouses with less
merchandise storage space than our corporate furnishings stores. Vendors normally ship directly to
our fulfillment centers, which in turn ship merchandise to our stores.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realize freight savings from truckload discounts and more efficient distribution of
merchandise by using fulfillment centers. We use our own tractor-trailers, local delivery trucks,
and various contract carriers to make weekly deliveries to individual stores.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Competition</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Rents&#146; businesses are highly competitive. We compete in the rent-to-own and credit
retail markets. Our largest competitor in the rent-to-own market is Rent-A-Center, Inc. We also
compete in the rent-to-rent market with national and local companies and, to a lesser extent, with
apartment owners who purchase or provide furniture for rental to tenants. Cort Business Services
Corporation is our largest rent-to-rent competitor.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although definitive industry statistics are not available, we believe that Aaron
Rents is one of the largest furniture rental companies in the United States. We also believe that
we generally have a favorable competitive position in that industry because of our manufacturing
capabilities, prompt delivery, competitive pricing, brand recognition and commitment to customer
service.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">




<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operations are extensively regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal
and state laws and regulations. In general such laws regulate applications for leases, late fees,
other finance rates, the form of disclosure statements, the substance and sequence of required
disclosures, the content of advertising materials, and certain collection procedures. Violations
of certain provisions of these laws may result in penalties ranging from nominal amounts up to and
including forfeiture of fees and other amounts due on leases. We do not believe that the various
laws and regulations have had or will have a material adverse effect on our operations. However,
we are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future
legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future
legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future
laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations and
earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of certain of the state and federal laws under which we operate follows. This
summary does not purport to be a complete summary of the laws referred to below or of all the laws
regulating our operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, 47 states, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, specifically
regulate rent-to-own transactions, including states in which we currently operate Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038;
Lease Ownership stores. Most of state rental purchase laws require rent-to-own companies to
disclose to their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments
to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed, and miscellaneous other
items. The more restrictive state rental purchase laws limit the total amount that a customer may
be charged for an item, or regulate the amount of deemed &#147;interest&#148; that rent-to-own companies may
charge on rent-to-own transactions, generally defining &#147;interest&#148; as rental fees paid in excess of
the &#147;retail&#148; price of the goods. Our long-established policy in all states is to disclose the terms
of our rental purchase transactions as a matter of good business ethics and customer service. We
believe we are in material compliance with the various state rental purchase laws.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the rent-to-own industry. Federal
legislation to regulate the industry has been proposed from time to time. We cannot predict
whether any such legislation will be enacted and what the impact of such legislation would be on
us. Although we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe
that existing and proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our sales and lease
ownership or other operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced a form of consumer lease as an alternative to our typical rental purchase
agreement in a number of states. The consumer lease differs from a rental purchase agreement in
that it has an initial lease term in excess of four months. Generally, state laws that govern the rent-to-own
industry only apply to lease agreements with an initial term of four months or less. The consumer
lease is governed by federal and state laws and regulations other than the state rental purchase
laws. The federal regulations applicable to the consumer lease require certain disclosures similar
to the rent-to-own regulations, but are generally less restrictive as to pricing and other charges.
We believe we are in material compliance with all laws applicable to our consumer leasing program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales and lease ownership franchise program is subject to Federal Trade Commission
(&#147;FTC&#148;) regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several
state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC
requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise offering circular containing
prescribed information. A number of states in which we might consider franchising also regulate
the sale of franchises and require registration of the franchise offering circular with state
authorities. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable franchise laws in those
states in which we do business and with laws in Canada.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot address these challenges successfully, we may not be able to expand our business

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of 2005, we added a net of 229 company-operated sales and lease ownership
stores. Opening large numbers of new stores requires significant start-up expenses, and new stores
are often not profitable until their second year of operation. Consequently, opening many stores
over a short period can materially decrease our net earnings for a time. This effect is sometimes
called &#147;new store drag.&#148; During 2006, we estimate that start-up expenses for new stores reduced
our pre-tax earnings by approximately $7&nbsp;million, or $.14 per diluted share. We cannot be certain
that we will be able to fully recover these significant costs in the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>We may not be able to attract qualified franchisees, which may slow the growth of our business.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth strategy depends significantly upon our franchisees developing new franchised sales
and lease ownership stores. We generally seek franchisees who meet our stringent business
background and financial criteria, and who are willing to enter into area development agreements
for several stores. A number of factors, however, could inhibit our ability to find qualified
franchisees, including general economic downturns or legislative or litigation developments that
make the rent-to-own industry less attractive to potential franchisees. These developments could
also adversely affect our franchisees&#146; ability to obtain adequate capital to develop and operate
new stores on time, or at all. Our inability to find qualified franchisees could slow our growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified franchisees who conform to our standards and requirements are also important to the
overall success of our business. Our franchisees, however, are independent contractors and not
employees, and consequently we cannot and do not control them to the same extent as our
company-operated stores. Our franchisees may fail in key areas, which could in turn slow our
growth, reduce our franchise revenues, or damage our image and reputation.

economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner, our profitability may decrease.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We frequently acquire other sales and lease ownership businesses. We acquired the rental
agreements, merchandise and assets of 40 stores through acquisitions in 2006. If we are unable to
integrate businesses we acquire successfully, we may incur substantial cost and delays in
increasing our customer base. In addition, the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may
divert management&#146;s attention from Aaron Rents&#146; existing business. Integration of an acquired
business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in an unfamiliar market, or a business
with a different management philosophy or operating style.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Our competitors could impede our ability to attract new customers, or cause current customers to
cease doing business with us.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industries in which we compete are highly competitive. In the sales and lease ownership
market, our competitors include national, regional and local operators of rent-to-own stores and
credit retailers. We compete in the rent-to-rent market with national and local companies and, to a
lesser extent, with apartment owners who purchase or provide furniture for rental to tenants. Some
of our competitors have significantly greater financial and operating resources, and greater name
recognition in certain markets, than we have. Greater financial resources may allow our
competitors to grow faster than us, including through acquisitions. This in turn may enable them to
enter new markets before we can, which may decrease our opportunities in those markets. Greater
name recognition, or better public perception of a competitor&#146;s reputation, may help them divert
market share away from us, even in our established markets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, new competitors may emerge. Current and potential competitors may establish
financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is
possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire
significant market share.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>If our independent franchisees fail to meet their debt service payments or other obligations under
outstanding loans guaranteed by us as part of a franchise loan program, amounts that the lenders
participating in the program could require us to pay to satisfy these obligations could have a
material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have guaranteed the borrowings of certain franchisees under a franchise loan program with
several banks with a maximum commitment amount of $125.0&nbsp;million, and we also guarantee franchisee
borrowings under certain other debt facilities. In the event these franchisees are unable to meet
their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default, we would be
unconditionally liable for a portion of the outstanding balance of the franchisees&#146; debt
obligations, which at December&nbsp;31, 2006 was $111.6&nbsp;million. Of this amount, approximately $81.3
million represents franchisee borrowings outstanding under the franchise loan program and
approximately $30.3&nbsp;million represents franchisee borrowings that we guarantee under other debt
facilities. Although we have had no significant losses associated with the franchisee loan and
guaranty program since its inception, and we believe that any losses associated with any defaults
would be mitigated through recovery of rental merchandise and other assets, we cannot guarantee
that there will be no significant losses in the future or that we will be able to adequately
mitigate any such losses. If we fail to adequately mitigate any such future losses, our business
and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Any loss of the services of our key executives, or our inability to attract and retain qualified

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that we have benefited substantially from Mr.&nbsp;Loudermilk, Sr.&#146;s leadership and that

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our corporate furnishings division depends on business customers for a significant percentage
of its rental revenues. Because businesses are likely to curb spending during economic downturns,

We calculate same store revenue growth by comparing revenues for comparable periods for all stores
open during the entirety of those periods. Even though we achieved significant same store revenue
growth in the past, we may not be able to increase same store revenues in the future. A number of
factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our same store revenues,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the states that regulate rent-to-own transactions have enacted disclosure laws which
require rent-to-own companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, total
amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be
imposed by them and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state rental purchase laws
limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the amount of deemed
&#147;interest&#148; that rent-to-own companies may charge on rent-to-own transactions, generally defining
&#147;interest&#148; as rental fees paid in excess of the &#147;retail&#148; price of the goods. We cannot guarantee
