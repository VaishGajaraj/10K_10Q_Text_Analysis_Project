<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>General  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Rents,&nbsp;Inc. is a leading U.S. company engaged in the combined businesses of the rental, lease ownership and specialty retailing of residential and
office furniture, consumer electronics, household appliances and accessories, with 714 systemwide stores, which includes both our company-operated and franchised stores, in 43 states and Puerto Rico
as of December&nbsp;31, 2002. Our major operating divisions are the Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership division, the Aaron Rents' Rent-to-Rent division, and the MacTavish
Furniture Industries division, which supplies nearly one-half of the furniture and related accessories rented and sold in our stores. Our strategic focus is on expanding our higher growth
sales and lease ownership business, through opening new company-operated stores and expanding our franchise program. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2002, we had 644 sales and lease ownership stores, including 387 company-operated sales and lease ownership stores, 25 company-operated Sight&nbsp;&amp; Sound stores
and 232 franchised stores in 43 states and Puerto Rico. There were 70 rent-to-rent stores in our rent-to-rent division in 16 states at
December&nbsp;31, 2002. Revenues from our sales and lease ownership division (which includes franchise revenues) accounted for 72% of our total revenues in 2001 and 81% of total revenues in 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
overview of our three divisions follows. </FONT></P>

durable household goods to lower to middle income consumers with limited or no access to traditional credit
sources such as bank financing, installment credit or credit cards. Our sales and lease ownership program enables these customers to obtain quality-of-life enhancing
merchandise that they might otherwise not be able to afford without incurring additional debt or long-term obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
franchise our sales and lease ownership stores in selected markets where we have no immediate plans to enter. We believe that our franchise program: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have added 205 company-operated and 96 franchised sales and lease ownership stores along with 25 Sight &amp; Sound stores since the beginning of 1999. We estimate that we will open
approximately 30 company-operated and approximately 50 franchised sales and lease ownership stores in 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Rents' Rent-to-Rent.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rent-to-rent division
rents new and rental return merchandise to individuals and businesses, with a focus on renting residential and office furniture to business customers. We have been in the
rent-to-rent business for over 47&nbsp;years and are the second largest furniture rent-to-rent company in the United States. The
rent-to-rent business continued to experience a decline in 2002 due to a weak economy and reduced corporate spending. In response, we closed 29
rent-to-rent stores since the beginning of 2001 and took other steps to improve this division's profitability. Our rent-to-rent division remains an
important source of net earnings and cash flow to us. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business
customers, which represent an increasing portion of rental customers, rent residential furniture in order to provide furnishings for relocated employees or those on temporary
assignment. </FONT></P>

advantage over many of our competitors. Manufacturing enables us to control the quality, cost, timing, styling and quantity of our furniture rental products. We operate five furniture plants, three
bedding facilities and two lamp manufacturing facilities, which supply nearly one-half of the furniture and related accessories we rent or sell. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Industry Overview  </B></FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> The Rent-to-Own Industry  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent-to-own industry is a growing segment of the retail industry that offers an alternative to traditional methods of obtaining
furniture, electronics and appliances. According to industry sources, there are approximately 8,000 rent-to-own stores in the United States. Annual industry-wide
revenues are believed to be approximately $5.3&nbsp;billion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
a typical rent-to-own transaction, the customer has the option to acquire merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 to 24&nbsp;months, by normally making
weekly rental payments. The customer may cancel the agreement at any time by returning the merchandise to the store, with no further rental obligation. If the customer rents the item to the full term,
he obtains ownership of the item, though he can choose to buy it at any time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
rent-to-own concept is particularly popular with consumers who cannot pay the full purchase price for merchandise at once or who lack the credit to qualify
under conventional financing programs. It is also popular with consumers who, despite good credit, do not wish to incur additional debt, have only a temporary need for the merchandise or want to try
out a particular brand or model before buying it. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership versus Traditional Rent-to-Own  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our sales and lease ownership model is unique. By providing customers with the option either to purchase merchandise or to lease merchandise with
the opportunity to obtain ownership, we blend elements of rent-to-own and traditional retailing. We enable cash or credit-constrained customers to obtain
quality-of-life enhancing merchandise that they otherwise might not be able to afford without incurring additional debt or long-term obligations. In addition to
these core customers, our concept is
also popular with consumers who have only a temporary need for the merchandise or want to try out a particular brand or model before buying it. We believe our sales and lease ownership program is a
more effective method of retailing our merchandise to lower to middle income consumers than a typical rent-to-own business or the more traditional method of credit installment
sales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
sales and lease ownership model is distinctive from a typical rent-to-own business in that we encourage our customers to obtain ownership of their rental
merchandise. More of the initial renters of our merchandise obtain ownership versus rent-to-own businesses in general. We believe our sales and lease ownership model offers the
following unique characteristics: </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
sales and lease ownership model also has attractive features in common with traditional retailers. We offer an up-front "cash and carry" purchase option on selected
merchandise at prices that are competitive with traditional retailers. Our merchandise selection and store size are more typical of traditional retailers. However, unlike most traditional retailers,
our sales and lease ownership transactions are not credit installment contracts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> The Rent-to-Rent Industry  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furniture component of the rent-to-rent industry is believed to be greater than $600&nbsp;million in annual rental revenues. The
demand for rental products is believed to be related to the mobility of the population, which relies upon rented merchandise to fulfill temporary needs. The industry is highly competitive and has
consolidated, with only a handful of companies accounting for a substantial share of the market. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
rent-to-rent industry serves both individual and business customers who generally have immediate, temporary needs for office or residential merchandise but
who generally do not seek to own the merchandise. Residential merchandise is rented to: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office
merchandise is rented by customers ranging from small businesses and professionals who are in need of office furnishings but need to conserve capital, to large corporations with
temporary or seasonal needs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the typical rent-to-rent transaction, the customer agrees to rent one or more items for a minimum of three months, which may be extended by the customer on a
month-to-month basis. Although many rental agreements give the customer the option of purchasing the rented item, most customers do not enter into the transaction with the
desire to own the rented merchandise. </FONT></P>

recurring business and encourage them to rent merchandise for the full agreement term by providing high levels of service and satisfaction. Aaron Rents demonstrates its commitment to superior customer
service by providing customers quick delivery of rented merchandise, in many cases by same or next day delivery, and repair service at no charge to the customer. We have also established an employee
training program designed to enhance the customer relations skills of our employees which we call Aaron's University, and a 13-course curriculum for both company-operated and franchised
store managers.

"Dream Products" merchandise which we advertise through our "Drive Dreams Home" sponsorship of NASCAR championship racing. Sponsorship of other sporting events also reach this market. We typically
distribute mass mailings of promotional material every two weeks, with the goal of reaching households within a specified radius of each store at least 24 times per year or about 13&nbsp;million
flyers mailed monthly nationwide. In concentrated geographic markets, and for special promotions, we also utilize local television and radio advertising.

our existing rent-to-rent stores, particularly in the business sector, while managing that division's costs and expenses to make best use of its net earnings and cash flow for
the development of our higher-growth operations. We believe that our ability to deliver furniture and equipment to our business customers quickly and efficiently gives us an advantage over general
furniture retailers who often require several weeks to effect delivery. In addition, we locate warehouses next to each showroom, permitting store managers to exercise greater control over inventory,
merchandise condition and pickup and deliveries. This results in more efficient and consistent service for the customer. The rent-to-rent business continued to experience a
decline in 2002 due to the weak economy and ongoing reduced corporate spending. Nevertheless, we believe that our rent-to-rent business will continue to provide us with cash
flow to finance a portion of the planned expansion of the sales and lease ownership division. In addition, we believe that as the economy rebounds there may be growth opportunities in the
rent-to-rent market, particularly in the business sector.

manufacturing operations and network of 11 distribution centers give us a strategic advantage over our competitors. Manufacturing enables us to control the quality, cost, styling, durability and
quantity of a substantial portion of our rental furniture merchandise, and provides us a reliable source of rental furniture. In 2002, we completed an expansion of our large manufacturing facility in
Cairo, Georgia, adding 100,000 square feet to almost double its capacity, and opened a new lamp manufacturing plant in Tampa, Florida. In addition, we closed a furniture plant in Sugarland, Texas
which allowed us to expand the distribution center that is located in the same facility. Our distribution system allows us to deliver merchandise promptly to our stores and manage inventory levels
more efficiently. During 2002, we opened four regional distribution centers in Phoenix, Arizona; Carolina Puerto Rico; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Madison, Tennessee, enhancing our nationwide
distribution system, and we plan to open two other distribution centers over the next year.

ownership stores in existing and selected new geographic markets where we can cluster stores to realize the benefits of economies of scale in marketing and distribution and other operating
efficiencies. In accordance with this strategy we added 23 store locations in 2002.

revenue growth of 13.0% in 2002, 7.7% in 2001 and 7.4% in 2000. We expect revenues and net earnings to continue to grow as a large number of stores opened in the past few years mature.

acquisitions of other rent-to-own operations as another way to increase our growth.

grow more quickly and increase our brand exposure in new markets. In addition, the larger number of systemwide sales and lease ownership stores enables us and our franchisees to realize economies of
scale in purchasing, manufacturing and advertising for our sales and lease ownership stores. Franchise fees and royalties also represent a growing source of company revenues. In 2002 we added 23
franchise locations and had a backlog at year-end 2002 of 213 stores licensed and scheduled to open over the next few years. </FONT></DD></DL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Sales and Lease Ownership  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We established our Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership division in 1987. At December&nbsp;31, 2002, we had 412 company-operated sales and lease ownership
stores, including 25 Sight&nbsp;&amp; Sound stores, in 25 states and Puerto Rico and 232 franchised sales and lease ownership stores in 36 states. During 2002, we completed the acquisition of Sight'n
Sound Appliance Centers,&nbsp;Inc., a specialty retailer of furniture, appliances and consumer electronics with 25 stores in Oklahoma and Kansas. Operating under a new Sight&nbsp;&amp; Sound name,
these stores are offering both retail sales to customers as well as the sales and lease ownership transaction for those customers who do not qualify for credit financing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that the decline in the number of furniture stores that focus on credit installment sales to lower to middle income consumers has created a market opportunity for us to offer
our unique sales and lease ownership concept. The traditional retail consumer durable goods market is much larger than the rental market, leaving substantial potential for growth for our sales and
lease ownership division. We believe that the segment of the population targeted by our sales and lease ownership division comprises up to approximately 43% of all households in the United States and
that the needs of consumers in that segment generally are underserved. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have developed a distinctive concept for our sales and lease ownership stores with specific merchandising selection and store layout, pricing and agreement terms for the customers we
want to attract. We believe that these features create a store and sales and lease ownership concept that is significantly different from the operations of rent-to-own stores,
our traditional rent-to-rent business, and the operations of home furnishings retailers who finance merchandise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
typical Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership store layout consists of a combination showroom and warehouse of 8,000 to 10,000 square feet, with an average of approximately 9,000
total square feet. In selecting new locations for sales and lease ownership stores, we generally look for sites in well-maintained strip shopping centers strategically located within ten
miles of established working class neighborhoods and communities with good access. Many of our stores are placed near existing competitors' stores. Each sales and lease ownership store usually
maintains at least two trucks and crews for pickups and deliveries, and generally offers same or next day delivery for addresses located within 15 miles of the store. We emphasize a broad selection of
brand name products for our electronics and appliance items, and offer customers a wide selection of furniture, including furniture manufactured by our MacTavish Furniture Industries division. Our
sales and lease ownership stores also offer computers and jewelry. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that our sales and lease ownership stores offer lower merchandise prices than similar items offered by rent-to-own operators, and substantially
equivalent to the "all-in" contract price of similar items offered by home furnishings retailers who finance merchandise. Approximately 80% of our sales and lease ownership agreements are
monthly as compared to the industry standard of weekly agreements, and our agreements also usually provide for a shorter term until the customer obtains ownership. Customers can have the item serviced
free of charge or replaced at any time during the rental agreement. Merchandise from the agreements that do not go to term is either re-rented or sold. We also offer, for selected
merchandise, an up-front cash and carry purchase option at prices that are competitive with traditional retailers. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Sales and Lease Ownership Franchise Program  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We began franchising Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership stores in selected markets in 1992, and have continued to attract franchisees. We do not anticipate
that franchised stores will compete with company-operated stores, as we mainly award franchises in markets where we are not present and have no current plans to expand. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002,
we have 232 franchise stores open and development agreements with franchisees to open 213 stores in the future. We believe that our relations with our franchisees are good. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franchisees
are approved on the basis of the applicant's business background and financial resources. We generally seek franchisees who will enter into development agreements for several
stores, although many franchisees currently operate a single store. Most franchisees are involved in the day-to-day operations of the stores. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
enter into franchise agreements with our franchisees to govern the opening and operation of franchised stores. Under our current standard agreement, we require the franchisee to pay a
franchise fee of $35,000 per store. Agreements are for a term of 10&nbsp;years, with one 10-year renewal option, and require royalty payments to us of 5% of the franchisee's weekly cash
collections. For all franchise agreements entered into or renewed after December&nbsp;31, 2002 the royalty payments will increase to 6%. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
assist each franchisee in selecting the proper site for each store. Because of the importance of location to the Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership concept, one of our
pre-opening directors visits the intended market and helps guide the franchisee through the selection process. Once a site is selected, we help in designing the floor plan, including the
proper layout of the showroom and warehouse. In addition, we provide assistance in assuring that the design and decor of the showroom is consistent with our requirements. We also lease the exterior
signage to the franchisee, and assist with placing pre-opening advertising, ordering initial inventory and obtaining delivery vehicles. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have an arrangement with a syndicate of banks to provide financing to qualifying franchisees to assist with establishing and operating their stores. An inventory financing plan to
provide franchisees with the capital to purchase inventory is a primary component of the financing program. For qualified established franchisees, we have arranged for these institutions to provide a
revolving credit line to </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
franchisees are required to complete a comprehensive training program and to operate their franchised sales and lease ownership stores in compliance with our policies, standards and
specifications, including such matters as decor, rental agreement terms, hours of operation, pricing and merchandise. Franchisees in general are not required to purchase their rental merchandise from
us, although most do so in order to take advantage of bulk purchasing discounts and favorable delivery terms. Many franchisees also purchase their rental furniture from our MacTavish Furniture
Industries division. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
conduct a financial audit of our franchise stores every six to 12&nbsp;months and also conduct regular operational audits&#151;generally visiting each franchise store almost
as often as we visit our company-operated stores. In addition, our proprietary management information system links each franchised store to corporate headquarters. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Rent-to-Rent  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been in the rent-to-rent business for over 47&nbsp;years and are the second largest furniture
rent-to-rent company in the United States. Our rent-to-rent business accounted for approximately 27% of total revenues for 2001 and 19% for 2002. We
rent new and rental return merchandise to both individuals and businesses, with a growing focus on renting residential and office furniture to business customers. As of December&nbsp;31, 2002, we
operated 70 rent-to-rent stores in 16 states. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
typical rent-to-rent store layout consists of a combination showroom and warehouse comprising about 19,000 square feet. Each residential showroom features
attractive displays of dining-room, living-room and bedroom furniture in a number of styles, fabrics, materials and colors. Office rental showrooms feature lines of desks,
chairs, conference tables, credenzas, sofas and accessories. We believe that locating a warehouse next to each showroom permits store managers to exercise greater control over inventory, merchandise
condition and pickup and deliveries, resulting in more efficient and consistent service for the customer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items
held for rent, whether new or rental return, are available for purchase and lease purchase at all rent-to-rent stores. Each
rent-to-rent store generally offers next day delivery for addresses located within 50 miles of the store, and maintains at least one truck and a crew for pickups and
deliveries. We believe that our ability to obtain and deliver furniture and equipment to customers quickly and efficiently gives us an advantage over general furniture retailers who often require
several weeks to effect delivery. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
generally sell rental return merchandise at stores at or above its book value, or cost less depreciation, plus selling expenses&#151;a price which is usually lower than the
price for comparable new merchandise. Most merchandise held for sale in stores may also be acquired through a lease purchase option. Because new merchandise is sold at the same location as rental
return merchandise, we have the opportunity to sell both new and rental return merchandise to customers who may have been attracted to the store by the advertising and price appeal of rental return
merchandise. The ability to sell new and rental return merchandise at the same location allows for more efficient use of facilities and personnel and minimizes overhead. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Furniture Manufacturing  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our manufacturing capability gives us a strategic advantage over our competitors by enabling us to control the quality, cost, timing, styling,
durability and quantity of our furniture rental products. As the only major furniture rental company that manufactures its own furniture, we believe that our 666,000 square feet of manufacturing
facilities provide us more flexibility in scheduling </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
principal raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing are fabric, foam, fiber, wire-innerspring assemblies, plywoods and hardwoods. All of these materials are
purchased in the open market from
sources not affiliated with us. We are not dependent on any single supplier, and none of the raw materials are in short supply. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Marketing and Advertising  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our sales and lease ownership operations, we rely heavily on national and local television advertising, direct mail and direct delivery of promotional
materials. We focus our television advertising on our successful "Dream Products" program. This program features "dream" products such as big screen televisions, home theater systems, leather
upholstery, stainless steel refrigerators and top brand name washers and dryers. To help promote the Dream Products program we established a relationship with NASCAR, which reaches a prime audience in
our targeted demographic. Our initial relationship was a title sponsorship of the NASCAR Busch Grand National Car Race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway the nationally televised "Aaron's 312," named for
Aaron's three reasons to obtain merchandise and its unique 12-month plan. We also sponsor the Aaron's 312 Nascar Busch Series Race and the Aaron's 499 Nascar Winston Cup Series Race at the
Talladega Superspeedway along with other sporting events. In addition, we established a limited sponsorship of driver Michael Waltrip's #99 Aaron's Dream Machine in the Busch Grand National Series. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
and lease ownership stores are located within neighborhood communities, and typically distribute mass mailings of promotional material every two weeks, with the goal of reaching
households </FONT></P>

radio advertising. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
market our rent-to-rent operations through outside sales staff to local apartment communities, calling on leasing agents, resident managers, and property

corporations that relocate personnel around the country. We have regional and national marketing staff that focuses on this growing segment of the rent-to-rent industry. We
also rely on the use of brochures, newspapers, radio, television, direct mail, trade publications, yellow pages, and the internet (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>http://www.aaronrentsfurniture.com;

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Management Information Systems  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use computer-based management information systems to facilitate cash collections, merchandise returns and inventory monitoring. Through the use of proprietary
software we have developed, each of our stores is linked by computer directly to corporate headquarters, which enables us to monitor the performance of each store on a daily basis. Different systems
are used to run the sales and lease ownership and rent-to-rent operations due to the significant differences in the businesses. At the store level, the store manager is better
able to track merchandise on the showroom floor and in the warehouse to minimize delivery times, assist with product purchasing and match customer needs with available inventory. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Rental Agreement Approval, Renewal and Collection  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the keys to the success of our sales and lease ownership operation is our ability to achieve timely cash collections. Individual store managers use our
computerized information system on a daily basis to track cash collections. They contact customers within a few days of when their lease payments are due in order to encourage customers to keep their
agreement current and in force, rather than having to return the merchandise for non-payment, and to renew their agreements for an additional
period. Careful attention to cash collections is particularly important in the sales and lease ownership operations, where the customer typically has the option to cancel the agreement at any time and
each payment is considered a renewal of the agreement rather than a collection of a receivable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
rent-to-rent store performs a credit check on most of its residential and business customers. We generally perform no formal credit check with respect to
sales and lease ownership customers other than to verify employment or other reliable sources of income and personal references supplied by the customer. All of our agreements for residential and
office merchandise require payments in advance, and the merchandise normally is repossessed if a payment is significantly in arrears. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net
bad debt losses from rent-to-rent rentals as a percentage of rent-to-rent rental revenues were approximately 1.6%, 2.7% and 2.1% for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We do not extend credit to sales and lease ownership customers. For the same periods, net merchandise shrinkage as a percentage
of combined rental revenues was 2.2%, 2.5%, and 2.5%, respectively. We believe that our collection and repossession policies comply with applicable legal requirements, and we discipline any employee
that we discover deviating from such policies. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Customer Service  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that customer service is one of the most important elements in the success of our sales and lease ownership and rent-to-rent
businesses. Customer satisfaction is critical because the customer usually has the option of returning the rented merchandise at any time. Our goal is to make our customers feel positive about Aaron
Rents and its products from the moment they enter our showrooms. Items are serviced at no charge to the customer, and quick, free delivery is available in many cases. In order to increase rentals at
existing stores, we foster relationships with existing customers to attract recurring business, and many new rental and lease ownership agreements are attributable to repeat customers. </FONT></P>

operated or franchised. Standardizing operating procedures throughout our system is a primary focus of Aaron's University. We have a 13-course curriculum for sales and lease ownership
managers. The rent-to-rent division's sales and management training programs have similar training conducted at our Atlanta headquarters. Our policy of promoting from within

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
purchase the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers, with the balance from local distributors. One of our largest suppliers is our own MacTavish Furniture Industries
division, which supplies nearly one-half of the furniture we rent or sell. We have no long-term agreements for the purchase of merchandise and believe that our relationships
with suppliers are good. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rent-to-rent
stores receive merchandise directly from vendors who ship to the stores' attached warehouses. Sales and lease ownership operations utilize
distribution centers to control merchandise. All company-operated sales and lease ownership stores receive merchandise directly from our 11 distribution centers located in Auburndale, Florida; Dallas
and Sugarland, Texas; Duluth, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Phoenix, Arizona; Carolina, Puerto Rico; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Madison, Tennessee. We
plan to open two other distribution centers over the next year. Most of our stores are within a 250-mile radius of a distribution center, assuring timely shipment of supplies to the stores
and fast delivery of orders to customers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
and lease ownership stores typically have smaller warehouses with less merchandise storage space than our rent-to-rent stores. Vendors ship directly to the
distribution centers. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
realize freight savings from truckload discounts and more efficient distribution of merchandise by using distribution centers. We use our own tractor-trailers, local delivery trucks,
and various contract carriers to make weekly deliveries to individual stores. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Competition  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Rents' businesses are highly competitive. We compete in the rent-to-rent market with national and local companies and, to a lesser
extent, with apartment owners who purchase furniture for rental to tenants. We believe that CORT Business Services Corporation is our most significant rent-to-rent competitor.
We also compete in the rent-to-own and credit retail markets. Our two largest competitors in the rent-to-own market are
Rent-A-Center,&nbsp;Inc. and Rent-Way,&nbsp;Inc. </FONT></P>

<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
definitive industry statistics are not available, we believe that Aaron Rents is one of the largest furniture rental companies in the United States. We also believe that we
generally have a favorable competitive position in that industry because of our manufacturing capabilities, prompt delivery, competitive pricing, brand recognition and commitment to customer service. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Government Regulation  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that 47 states specifically regulate rent-to-own transactions, including states in which we currently operate Aaron's
Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership stores. Most of these states have enacted disclosure laws which require rent-to-own companies to disclose to their customers the total number of
payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed by them and miscellaneous other items. The most restrictive states limit the
total amount that a customer may be charged for an item to twice the "retail" price for the item, or regulate the amount of "interest" that rent-to-own companies may charge on
rent-to-own transactions, generally defining "interest" as rental fees paid in excess of the "retail" price of the goods. Our long-established policy in all states
is to disclose the terms of our rental purchase transactions as a matter of good business ethics and customer service. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the rent-to-own industry. Federal legislation has been proposed from time to time to regulate the
industry, and bills supported by the rent-to-own industry group are currently under consideration in both houses of Congress. We cannot predict whether any such legislation
will be enacted and what the impact of such legislation would be on us. Although we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe that existing and proposed
regulations will have a material adverse impact on our sales and lease ownership or other operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
sales and lease ownership store franchise program is subject to Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises.
Several state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise offering circular containing
prescribed information. A number of states in which we might consider franchising also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of the franchise offering circular with state
authorities. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable franchise laws. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Employees  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2002, Aaron Rents had approximately 4,800 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe
that our relations with our employees are good. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Information on Segments and Geographic Areas  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently only operate in the United States and Puerto Rico. Information on our four reportable segments&#151;sales and lease ownership,
rent-to-rent, franchise and manufacturing&#151;is set forth in Note&nbsp;L to our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Item 8 of Part&nbsp;II. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain written and oral statements made by our Company may constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995, including statements made in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Generally, the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "intend", "estimate,"
"project," "will," and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. All statements which address operating performance, events or developments
that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future including growth in store openings and franchises awarded, market share, and statements expressing general optimism about future operating results
are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's historical experience
and the Company's present expectations or projections. As and when made, management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, caution should be taken not to place undue
reliance on any such forward-looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For a discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties see the following risk factors: </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our growth strategy depends on opening new company-operated stores. Our ability to expand our store base is influenced by factors beyond our control, which may impair our
growth strategy and impede our revenue growth.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening new company-operated stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Our ability to continue opening new stores depends, among other things, upon our
ability to: </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we cannot address these challenges successfully, we may not be able to expand our business at the rate we currently contemplate, or increase our revenues. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>If we cannot manage the costs of opening new stores, our profitability may be hurt.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of 2001, we added a total of 124 company-operated sales and lease ownership stores. These new openings include most of the approximately 80
locations we acquired in 2000 and early 2001 formerly operated by one of the nation's largest furniture retailers. Opening large numbers of new stores requires significant start-up
expenses, and new stores are often not profitable until their second year of operation. Consequently, opening many stores over a short period can materially decrease our net earnings for a time this
effect is sometimes called "new store drag." During 2002, we estimate that start-up expenses for new stores reduced our pre-tax earnings by approximately $7&nbsp;million, or
.20 per diluted share. We cannot be certain that we will be able to fully recover these significant costs in the future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our competitors could impede our ability to attract new customers, or attract current customers away from us.  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our businesses are highly competitive. In the sales and lease ownership market, our competitors include national, regional and local operators of
rent-to-own stores and credit retailers. We compete in the rent-to-rent market with national and local companies and, to a lesser extent, with apartment
owners who purchase furniture for rental to tenants. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and operating resources, and in certain markets, greater name recognition, than us.

financial resources may allow our competitors to grow faster than us, including through acquisitions. This in turn may allow them to enter new markets before we can, which may decrease our
opportunities in those markets. Greater name recognition, or better public perception of a competitor's reputation, may help them attract market share away from us, even in our established markets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Because our rent-to-rent division is dependent on business customers, slowdowns in corporate spending may decrease our revenues.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rent-to-rent division depends on business customers for a significant percentage of its rental revenues. Because businesses are likely
to curb spending during economic downturns, the revenues of our rent-to-rent business may be adversely affected during these periods. Revenues from our
rent-to-rent division decreased 20% in 2002 compared with 2001 revenues. We cannot assure you that revenues from our rent-to-rent division will increase
in the future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>We may not be able to attract qualified franchisees, which may slow the growth of our business.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our franchisees developing new franchised sales and lease ownership stores. We generally seek franchisees who meet
our stringent business background and financial criteria, and who are willing to enter into development agreements for several stores. A number of factors, however, could inhibit our ability to find
qualified franchisees, including general economic downturns, or legislative or litigation developments that make the rent-to-own industry less attractive to potential
franchisees. These developments could also adversely affect our franchisees' ability to obtain adequate capital to develop and operate new stores on time, or at all. Our inability to find qualified
franchisees could slow our growth. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified
franchisees who can conform to our standards and requirements are also important to the overall success of our business. Our franchisees, however, are independent contractors
and not employees, and consequently we cannot control them to the same extent as our company-operated stores. Our franchisees may fail in key areas, which could in turn slow our growth, reduce our
franchise revenues and systemwide revenues, or damage our image and reputation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>We are subject to laws that regulate franchisor-franchisee relationships. Our ability to develop new franchised stores and enforce our rights against franchisees may be
adversely affected by these laws, which could impair our growth strategy and cause our franchise revenues to decline.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a franchisor, we are subject to both regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Because we plan to
expand our business partly by selling more franchises, our failure to obtain or maintain approvals to sell franchises could significantly impede our growth strategy. In addition, our failure to comply
with franchise regulations could cause us to lose franchise fee and ongoing royalty revenues. Moreover, state laws that regulate substantive aspects of our relationships with franchisees may limit our
ability to terminate or otherwise resolve conflicts with our franchisees. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our sales and lease ownership operations are subject to considerable government regulation. Adverse changes in these laws could expose us to significant compliance costs or
burdens or expose us to material litigation, which could leave us liable for a significant judgment or force us to change our business.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that 47 states specifically regulate rent-to-own transactions, including states in which we currently operate Aaron's
Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership stores. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the rent-to-own industry, although federal legislation has been proposed from

the states or the federal government, could materially increase both our costs of complying with laws and the risk that we could be sued or be subject to government sanctions if we are not in
compliance. In addition, new burdensome legislation might force us to change our business model, and might render our sales and lease ownership operations a less desirable business to engage in. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
of the states that regulate rent-to-own transactions have enacted disclosure laws which require rent-to-own companies to disclose to
their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed by them and miscellaneous other items. The
most restrictive states limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item to twice the "retail" price for the item, or regulate the amount of "interest" that
rent-to-own companies may charge on rent-to-own transactions, generally defining "interest" as rental fees paid in excess of the "retail" price of the
goods. We cannot guarantee that the federal government or states will not enact additional or different legislation that would be disadvantageous to us. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to the risk of lawsuits related to the disclosure laws that regulate rent-to-own transactions, we could be subject to lawsuits alleging violations of
state laws and regulations and consumer tort law, including fraud and consumer protection laws because of the consumer-oriented nature of the rent-to-own industry and the
currently applicable laws. A large judgment could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, an adverse outcome from a lawsuit even one against one of our
competitors instead of against us could result in changes in the way we and others in the industry do business, which may involve significant costs or decreased revenues or profitability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer owns a controlling interest in our stock. He may vote his shares in ways with which you may disagree.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, owns or controls over 60% of our voting Class&nbsp;A stock. As a
result, Mr.&nbsp;Loudermilk will continue to be able to elect all our directors and effectively control Aaron Rents through his voting power. He may vote his shares in ways with which you may
disagree, and this voting concentration may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or acquisition of Aaron Rents, even one that you believe is beneficial to you as a shareholder. Also,
future sales by Mr.&nbsp;Loudermilk of a substantial number of common shares could adversely affect the trading price of our shares. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Any loss of the services of our key executives, or our inability to attract and retain qualified managers, could have a material adverse impact on our operations.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that we have benefited substantially from Mr.&nbsp;Loudermilk's leadership, and that the loss of his services at any time in the near future could
hurt our business and operations. We are also dependent on the continued services of the rest of our management team, including our key executives. The loss of these individuals without adequate
replacement could also injure our business. Although we
have employment agreements with some of our key executives, they are generally terminable on short notice and we do not carry key man life insurance on any of our officers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
we need a growing number of qualified managers to operate our stores successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so
increase significantly, our operations would be materially adversely affected. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
executive and administrative offices occupy approximately 40,000 square feet in an 11-story, 87,000 square-foot office building that we own in Atlanta. We
lease most of the remaining space to third parties under leases with remaining terms averaging three years. To meet the needs of Aaron Rents' strong growth, a two story building with over 50,000
square feet of new office space was completed during 2001 in the Atlanta suburb of Kennesaw to accommodate our financial and information technology operations. In 2002, the Company sold this land and
building to a partnership controlled by the majority shareholder, and is leasing the property back over 15&nbsp;years, with two five year renewal options. See Note&nbsp;E to our Consolidated
Financial Statements. We believe that all of our facilities are well maintained and adequate for their current and reasonably foreseeable uses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2003, the Florida District Court of Appeals, First District, affirmed per curiam the decision of the Circuit Court for Escambia County,
Florida, First District, granting Aaron Rents summary judgment in its favor in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>VanWhy v. Aaron Rents,&nbsp;Inc.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
(No.&nbsp;001278-CA-01 filed July&nbsp;26</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>, </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>2000). The plaintiffs in that case alleged technical violations of the Florida
Consumer Collection Practices Act and related claims, sought certification as a class action and alleged statutory damages of $500 per violation. With Aaron Rents' victory in the appellate court, this
case has now been concluded. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron
Rents has moved for summary judgment in another case pending in the Circuit Court for Escambia County, Florida, First District, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Kimberly King v. Aaron
Rents,&nbsp;Inc.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (No.&nbsp;2001-CA-2277 filed November&nbsp;9, 2001). The </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>King</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> case involves facts
and claims substantially identical to the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>VanWhy</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> case described above, with the exception that the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>King</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
case also alleges violations of the Florida Unfair Deceptive Trade Practices Act. We do not know of any reason why the result in this case should be any different than in the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>VanWhy</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> case discussed
above; however, given the novelty of the action and the uncertainty of consumer class actions, there can be no assurance that such
will be the case. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
time to time, we are party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not currently a party to any other legal proceeding the
result of which it believes could have a material adverse impact upon its business, financial position or results of operations. </FONT></P>

internal controls subsequent to the date that Company management conducted its last evaluation of internal controls. </FONT></P>
