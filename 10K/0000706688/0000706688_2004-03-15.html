<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Rents,&nbsp;Inc. is a leading U.S. company engaged in the combined businesses of the rental, lease ownership and specialty retailing of consumer
electronics, residential and office furniture, household appliances, and accessories, with 847 systemwide stores, which includes both our company-operated and franchised stores, in 43 states, Puerto
Rico and Canada as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. Our major operating divisions are the Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership division, the Aaron Rents' Rent-to-Rent division,
and the MacTavish Furniture Industries division, which supplies nearly one-half of the furniture and related accessories rented and sold in our stores. Our strategic focus is on expanding
our higher growth sales and lease ownership business, through opening new company-operated stores, expanding our franchise program, and making selective opportunistic acquisitions </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2003, we had 787 sales and lease ownership stores, including 500 company-operated stores in 26 states and 287 franchised stores in 39 states, Puerto Rico and
Canada. There were also 60 rent-to-rent stores in our rent-to-rent division in 14 states at December&nbsp;31, 2003. Revenues from our sales and lease
ownership division (which includes franchise revenues) accounted for 86%, 81%, and 72% of our total revenues in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An
overview of our three divisions follows. </FONT></P>

durable household goods to lower to middle income consumers with limited or no access to traditional credit sources such as bank financing, installment credit or credit cards. Our sales and lease
ownership program enables these customers to obtain quality-of-life enhancing merchandise that they might otherwise not be able to afford without incurring additional debt or
long-term obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
franchise our sales and lease ownership stores in selected markets where we have no immediate plans to enter. We believe that our franchise program: </FONT></P>

us to grow more quickly

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have added 136 company-operated and 78 franchised sales and lease ownership stores since the beginning of 2002. We estimate that we will open approximately 80 company-operated and
approximately 60 franchised sales and lease ownership stores in 2004, as well as seek selective acquisitions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Rents' Rent-to-Rent.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rent-to-rent division
rents new and rental return merchandise to individuals and businesses, with a focus on renting residential and office furniture to business customers. We have been in the
rent-to-rent business for over 48&nbsp;years and believe we are the second largest furniture rent-to-rent company in the United States. The
rent-to-rent business continued to experience a decline in 2003 due to a weak economy and reduced corporate spending. In response, we have reduced our
rent-to-rent store count by 15 stores since the beginning of 2002 and took other steps to improve this division's profitability. Our rent-to-rent
division remains an important source of net earnings and cash flow to us. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business
customers, who represent an increasing portion of rental customers, rent residential furniture in order to provide furnishings for relocated employees or those on temporary
assignment.

States that manufactures its own furniture. By manufacturing our own specially designed residential and office furniture through our MacTavish Furniture Industries division, we believe we enjoy an
advantage over many of our competitors. Manufacturing enables us to control the quality, cost, timing, styling and quantity of our furniture rental products. We operate five furniture plants, three
bedding facilities and two lamp manufacturing facilities, which supply nearly one-half of the furniture and related accessories we rent or sell. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Industry Overview  </B></FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> The Rent-to-Own Industry  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent-to-own industry is a growing segment of the retail industry that offers an alternative to traditional methods of obtaining
furniture, electronics and appliances. According to industry sources, there are approximately 8,300 rent-to-own stores in the United States. Annual industry-wide
revenues are believed to be approximately $6.0&nbsp;billion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
a typical rent-to-own transaction, the customer has the option to acquire merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 to 24&nbsp;months, normally by making
weekly rental payments. The customer may cancel the agreement at any time by returning the merchandise to the store, with no further rental obligation. If the customer rents the item to the full term,
he obtains ownership of the item, though he can choose to buy it at any time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
rent-to-own concept is particularly popular with consumers who cannot pay the full purchase price for merchandise at once or who lack the credit to qualify
under conventional financing programs. It is also popular with consumers who, despite good credit, do not wish to incur additional debt, have only a temporary need for the merchandise, or want to try
out a particular brand or model before buying it. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership versus Traditional Rent-to-Own  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our sales and lease ownership model is unique. By providing customers with the option either to purchase or lease merchandise with the opportunity
to obtain ownership, we blend elements of rent-to-own and traditional retailing. We enable cash or credit-constrained customers to obtain
quality-of-life enhancing merchandise that they otherwise might not be able to afford without incurring additional debt or long-term obligations. In addition to
these core customers, our concept is also popular with consumers who have only a temporary need for the merchandise or want to try out a particular brand or model before buying it. We believe our
sales and lease ownership program is a more effective method of retailing our merchandise to lower to middle income consumers than a typical rent-to-own business or the more
traditional method of credit installment sales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
sales and lease ownership model is distinctive from a typical rent-to-own business in that we encourage our customers to obtain ownership of their rental
merchandise. More of the initial renters of our merchandise obtain ownership versus rent-to-own businesses in general. We believe our sales and lease ownership model offers the
following unique characteristics: </FONT></P>

<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Flexible payment methods</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;we offer our customers the opportunity to pay by cash, credit card or check, compared
with the more common cash payment method at rent-to-own stores. Approximately 40% of our customers pay by check or credit card. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>

rent-to-own stores. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
sales and lease ownership model also has attractive features in common with traditional retailers. We offer an up-front "cash and carry" purchase option on selected
merchandise at prices that are competitive with traditional retailers. Our merchandise selection and store size are more typical of traditional retailers. However, unlike most traditional retailers,
our sales and lease ownership transactions are not credit installment contracts. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> The Rent-to-Rent Industry  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furniture component of the rent-to-rent industry is believed to be greater than $600&nbsp;million in annual rental revenues. The
demand for rental products is believed to be related to the mobility of the population, which relies upon rented merchandise to fulfill temporary needs. The industry is highly competitive and has
consolidated, with only a handful of companies accounting for a substantial share of the market. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
rent-to-rent industry serves both individual and business customers who generally have immediate, temporary needs for residential or office merchandise but
who usually do not seek to own the merchandise. Residential merchandise is rented to: </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office
merchandise is rented by customers ranging from small businesses and professionals who are in need of office furnishings but need to conserve capital, to large corporations with
temporary or seasonal needs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the typical rent-to-rent transaction, the customer agrees to rent one or more items for a minimum of three months, which may be extended by the customer on a
month-to-month basis. Although many rental agreements give the customer the option of purchasing the rented item, most customers do not enter into the transaction with the
desire to own the rented merchandise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Operating Strategies  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Rents seeks to enhance profitability through operating strategies that differentiate us from our competitors and improve efficiencies by striving to: </FONT></P>

operation is attributable to our distinctive approach to the business that sets us apart from our rent-to-own and credit retail competitors. We have pioneered innovative
approaches to meeting changing customer needs that differ from our competitors' such as offering lease ownership agreements which result in a lower "all-in" price, larger and more
attractive store showrooms, a wider selection of higher-quality merchandise and up-front cash and carry purchase options on selected merchandise at prices that are competitive with
traditional retailers. Most sales and lease ownership customers make their payments in person, and we use these frequent visits to strengthen customer relationships and make sales and lease ownership
customers feel welcome in our stores. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>
<!-- ZEQ.=3,SEQ=4,EFW="2130820",CP="AARON RENTS, INC.",DN="1",CHK=560024,FOLIO='3',FILE='DISK027:[04ATA2.04ATA1142]DE1142A.;7',USER='SSTANSE',CD='12-MAR-2004;14:46' -->

</DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Offer high levels of customer service and satisfaction.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> We foster relationships with our customers to attract recurring
business and encourage them to rent merchandise for the full agreement term by providing high levels of service and satisfaction. Aaron Rents demonstrates its commitment to superior customer service
by providing customers quick delivery of rented merchandise, in many cases by same or next day delivery, and repair service at no charge to the customer. We have also established an employee training
program designed to enhance the customer relations skills of our employees that we call Aaron's University, and a 13-course curriculum for both company-operated and franchised store
managers.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Promote our brand name.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Our marketing programs target the prime customer base for our products, such as our "Dream Products"
merchandise, which we advertise through our "Drive Dreams Home" sponsorship of NASCAR championship racing. Sponsorship of other sporting events also reaches this market. We typically distribute mass
mailings of promotional material every two weeks, with the goal of reaching households within a specified radius of each store at least 24 times per year. We currently mail about 16&nbsp;million
flyers monthly nationwide. In concentrated geographic markets, and for special promotions, we also utilize local television and radio advertising.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Capitalize on our existing rent-to-rent business.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> We strive to increase revenues in our existing
rent-to-rent stores, particularly in the business sector, while managing that division's costs and expenses to make best use of its net earnings and cash flow for the
development of our higher-growth operations. We believe that our ability to deliver furniture and equipment to our business customers quickly and efficiently gives us an advantage over general
furniture retailers who often require several weeks to effect delivery. In addition, we locate warehouses next to each showroom, permitting store managers to exercise greater control over inventory,
merchandise condition and pickup and deliveries. This results in more efficient and consistent service for the customer. The rent-to-rent business continued to experience a
decline in 2003 due to the weak economy and ongoing reduced corporate spending. Nevertheless, we believe that our rent-to-rent business will continue to provide us with cash
flow to finance a portion of the planned expansion of the sales and lease ownership division. In addition, we believe that as the economy rebounds there may be growth opportunities in the
rent-to-rent market, particularly in the business sector.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Manage merchandise through our manufacturing and distribution capabilities.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> We believe that our furniture manufacturing
operations and network of 11 distribution centers at December&nbsp;31, 2003 give us a strategic advantage over our competitors. Manufacturing enables us to control the quality, cost, styling,
durability and quantity of a substantial portion of our rental furniture merchandise, and provides us a reliable source of rental furniture. Our distribution system allows us to deliver merchandise
promptly to our stores and manage inventory levels more efficiently. We opened our 12<SUP>th</SUP> distribution center in January&nbsp;2004 and plan to open several more distribution centers in
2004.

systematically pursue collections and merchandise returns and to match inventory with demand. Each of our stores, including franchised sales and lease ownership stores, is linked by computer directly
to our corporate headquarters, which enables us to monitor the performance of each store on a daily basis. Our separate systems are tailored to meet the distinct needs of our sales and lease ownership
and rent-to-rent operations. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seek to increase our revenues and profitability through our growth strategies. Our growth strategies are to: </FONT></P>

<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Open additional company-operated sales and lease ownership stores.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Our strategy is to open sales and lease ownership stores
in existing and selected new geographic markets where we can cluster stores to realize the benefits of economies of scale in marketing and distribution and other operating efficiencies. In accordance
with this strategy we added 88 store locations in 2003.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Increase revenues and net earnings from existing sales and lease ownership stores.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> We experienced same store revenue growth
of 10.1% in 2003, 13.0% in 2002, and 7.7% in 2001. We expect revenues and net earnings to continue to grow as a large number of stores opened in the past few years mature.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Seek acquisitions in both new and existing sales and lease ownership markets.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> We will continue to explore acquisitions of
other rent-to-own operations as another way to increase our growth. In 2003, we acquired 98 sales and lease ownership locations through acquisition. Some of these locations
were subsequently merged with existing locations.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Award additional sales and lease ownership franchises.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> We believe that our franchise program allows us to grow more quickly
and increase our brand exposure in new markets. In addition, the larger number of systemwide sales and lease ownership stores enables us and our franchisees to realize economies of scale in
purchasing, manufacturing and advertising for our sales and lease
ownership stores. Franchise fees and royalties also represent a growing source of company revenues. In 2003 we added 55 franchise locations and had a pipeline at year-end 2003 of 241
stores scheduled to open over the next few years. </FONT></DD></DL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Sales and Lease Ownership  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We established our Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership division in 1987. At December&nbsp;31, 2003, we had 500 company-operated sales and lease ownership
stores in 26 states and Puerto Rico and 287 franchised sales and lease ownership stores in 39 states and Canada. We believe that the decline in the number of furniture stores that focus on credit
installment sales to lower to middle income consumers has created a market opportunity for us to offer our unique sales and lease ownership concept. The traditional retail consumer durable goods
market is much larger than the rental market, leaving substantial potential for growth for our sales and lease ownership division. We believe that the segment of the population targeted by our sales
and lease ownership division comprises over 40% of all households in the United States and that the needs of consumers in that segment generally are underserved. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have developed a distinctive concept for our sales and lease ownership stores with specific merchandising selection and store layout, pricing, and agreement terms for the customers we
want to attract. We believe that these features create a store and sales and lease ownership concept that is significantly different from the operations of rent-to-own stores,
our traditional rent-to-rent business, and the operations of home furnishings retailers who finance merchandise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
typical Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership store layout consists of a combination showroom and warehouse of 8,000 to 10,000 square feet, with an average of approximately 9,000
total square feet. In selecting new locations for sales and lease ownership stores, we generally look for sites in well-maintained strip shopping centers strategically located within ten
miles of established working class neighborhoods and communities with good access. Many of our stores are placed near existing competitors' stores. Each sales and lease ownership store usually
maintains at least two trucks and
<!-- ZEQ.=5,SEQ=6,EFW="2130820",CP="AARON RENTS, INC.",DN="1",CHK=265957,FOLIO='5',FILE='DISK027:[04ATA2.04ATA1142]DE1142A.;7',USER='SSTANSE',CD='12-MAR-2004;14:46' -->

crews for pickups and deliveries, and generally offers same or next day delivery for addresses located within 15 miles of the store. We emphasize a broad selection of brand name products for our
electronics and appliance items, and offer customers a wide selection of furniture, including furniture manufactured by our MacTavish Furniture Industries division. Our sales and lease ownership
stores also offer computers and jewelry. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that our sales and lease ownership stores offer lower merchandise prices than similar items offered by rent-to-own operators, and substantially
equivalent to the "all-in" contract price of similar items offered by home furnishings retailers who finance merchandise. Approximately 75% of our sales and lease ownership agreements are
monthly as compared to the industry standard of weekly agreements, and our agreements also usually provide for a shorter term until the customer obtains ownership. Customers can have the item serviced
free of charge or replaced at any time during the rental agreement. Merchandise from the agreements that do not go to term is either re-rented or sold. We also offer, for selected
merchandise, an up-front cash and carry purchase option at prices that are competitive with traditional retailers. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Sales and Lease Ownership Franchise Program  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We began franchising Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership stores in selected markets in 1992, and have continued to attract franchisees. We do not anticipate
that franchised stores will compete with company-operated stores, as we mainly award franchises in markets where we are not present and have no current plans to expand. As of December&nbsp;31, 2003,
we have 287 franchise stores open and area development agreements with franchisees to open 241 stores in the future. We believe that our relations with our franchisees are good. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franchisees
are approved on the basis of the applicant's business background and financial resources. We generally seek franchisees who will enter into area development agreements for
several stores, although many franchisees currently operate a single store. Most franchisees are involved in the day-to-day operations of the stores. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
enter into franchise agreements with our franchisees to govern the opening and operation of franchised stores. Under our current standard agreement, we require the franchisee to pay a
franchise fee of $35,000 per store. Agreements are for a term of 10&nbsp;years, with one 10-year renewal option, and require royalty payments to us of 5% of the franchisee's weekly cash
collections. For all franchise agreements entered into or renewed after December&nbsp;31, 2002 the royalty payments increased to 6%. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
assist each franchisee in selecting the proper site for each store. Because of the importance of location to the Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership concept, one of our
pre-opening directors visits the intended market and helps guide the franchisee through the selection process. Once a site is selected, we help in designing the floor plan, including the
proper layout of the showroom and warehouse. In addition, we provide assistance in assuring that the design and decor of the showroom is consistent with our requirements. We also lease the exterior
signage to the franchisee, and assist with placing pre-opening advertising, ordering initial inventory and obtaining delivery vehicles. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have an arrangement with a syndicate of banks to provide financing to qualifying franchisees to assist with establishing and operating their stores. An inventory financing plan to
provide franchisees with the capital to purchase inventory is a primary component of the financing program. For qualified established franchisees, we have arranged for these institutions to provide a
revolving credit line to allow franchisees the flexibility to expand. We guarantee amounts outstanding under the franchisee financing programs. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
franchisees are required to complete a comprehensive training program and to operate their franchised sales and lease ownership stores in compliance with our policies, standards and
specifications, including such matters as decor, rental agreement terms, hours of operation, pricing and
<!-- ZEQ.=6,SEQ=7,EFW="2130820",CP="AARON RENTS, INC.",DN="1",CHK=623849,FOLIO='6',FILE='DISK027:[04ATA2.04ATA1142]DE1142A.;7',USER='SSTANSE',CD='12-MAR-2004;14:46' -->

merchandise. Franchisees in general are not required to purchase their rental merchandise from our distribution centers, although most do so in order to take advantage of bulk purchasing discounts and
favorable delivery terms. Several franchisees also purchase their rental furniture directly from our MacTavish Furniture Industries division. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
conduct a financial audit of our franchise stores every six to 12&nbsp;months and also conduct regular operational audits&#151;generally visiting each franchise store almost
as often as we visit our company-operated stores. In addition, our proprietary management information system links each franchised store to corporate headquarters. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Rent-to-Rent  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been in the rent-to-rent business for over 48&nbsp;years and are the second largest furniture
rent-to-rent company in the United States. Our rent-to-rent business accounted for approximately 14% of total revenues for 2003, 19% for 2002, and 27%
for 2001. We rent new and rental return merchandise to both individuals and businesses, with a growing focus on renting residential and office furniture to business customers. As of
December&nbsp;31, 2003, we operated 60 rent-to-rent stores in 14 states. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
typical rent-to-rent store layout consists of a combination showroom and warehouse comprising about 19,000 square feet. Each residential showroom features
attractive displays of dining room, living room and bedroom furniture in a number of styles, fabrics, materials and colors. Office rental showrooms feature lines of desks, chairs, conference tables,
credenzas, sofas and accessories. We believe that locating a warehouse next to each showroom permits store managers to exercise greater control over inventory, merchandise condition, and pickup and
deliveries, resulting in more efficient and consistent service for the customer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items
held for rent, whether new or rental return, are available for purchase and lease purchase at all rent-to-rent stores. Each
rent-to-rent store generally offers next day delivery for addresses located within 50 miles of the store, and maintains at least one truck and a crew for pickups and
deliveries. We believe that our ability to obtain and deliver furniture and equipment to customers quickly and efficiently gives us an advantage over general furniture retailers who often require
several weeks to effect delivery. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
generally sell rental return merchandise at stores at or above its book value, or cost less depreciation, plus selling expenses&#151;a price which is usually lower than the
price for comparable new merchandise. Most merchandise held for sale in stores may also be acquired through a lease purchase option. Because new merchandise is sold at the same location as rental
return merchandise, we have the opportunity to sell both new and rental return merchandise to customers who may have been attracted to the store by the advertising and price appeal of rental return
merchandise. The ability to sell new and rental return merchandise at the same location allows for more efficient use of facilities and personnel and minimizes overhead. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Furniture Manufacturing  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our manufacturing capability gives us a strategic advantage over our competitors by enabling us to control the quality, cost, timing, styling,
durability and quantity of our furniture rental
products. As the only major furniture rental company that manufactures its own furniture, we believe that our 673,000 square feet of manufacturing facilities provide us more flexibility in scheduling
production runs and in meeting inventory needs than rental companies that do not manufacture their own furniture and are dependent upon third party suppliers. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
MacTavish Furniture Industries division has manufactured furniture for our stores since 1971. The division has five furniture manufacturing plants, three bedding manufacturing
facilities and two lamp manufacturing facilities that supply nearly one-half of the furniture and accessories we rent or sell. We believe our manufacturing plants have the capacity to meet
our needs for the foreseeable future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
principal raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing are fabric, foam, fiber, wire-innerspring assemblies, plywoods and hardwoods. All of these materials are
purchased in the open market from sources not affiliated with us. We are not dependent on any single supplier, and none of the raw materials are in short supply. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Marketing and Advertising  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our sales and lease ownership operations, we rely heavily on national and local television advertising, direct mail and direct delivery of promotional
materials. We focus our television advertising on our successful "Dream Products" program. This program features "dream" products such as wide screen televisions, computers, stainless steel
refrigerators, top brand name washers and dryers, scooters and lawn tractors. To help promote the Dream Products program we continued our relationship with NASCAR, which reaches a prime audience in
our targeted demographic. We promote our brand, as well as our vendors' products, by sponsoring a NASCAR Busch Series at the Atlanta Motor Speedway. The race is titled Aaron's 312, promoting our three
reasons to obtain merchandise and our unique 12-month lease ownership plan. We also sponsor the Aaron's Dream Weekend at Talladega Superspeedway consisting of the Aaron's 312 NASCAR Busch
Series Race and the Aaron's 499 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series Race. We have continued our sponsorship of driver Michael Waltrip's #99 Aaron's Dream Machine in the Busch Series. In addition, we are a league
sponsor in the Arena Football League broadcast nationally on NBC. This agreement includes uniform patches on all visiting teams' jerseys and local promotions through out the country. Football oriented
commercials have been produced to air during the Arena Football League broadcast, featuring hall of fame football personality Terry Bradshaw. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
and lease ownership stores are located within neighborhood communities, and mass mailings of promotional material are typically distributed every two weeks. The goal is to reach
households within a specified radius of each store at least 24 times per year&#151;or about 16&nbsp;million flyers currently mailed monthly nationwide. In addition, delivery personnel are
trained to leave promotional material at

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
market our rent-to-rent operations through outside sales staff to local apartment communities, calling on leasing agents, resident managers, and property
managers. This group heavily influences individual referral business as well as corporate relocation professionals. We also market to interim housing providers that offer temporary housing to
corporations that relocate personnel around the country. We have regional and national marketing staff that focuses on this growing segment of the rent-to-rent industry. We
also rely on the use of brochures, newspapers, radio, television, direct mail, trade publications, yellow pages, and the internet (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>http://www.aaronrents.com;

internal audit department conducts periodic audits of every store, including audits of company-operated sales and lease ownership stores several times each year, and
semi-annual audits of rent-to-rent stores and franchised sales and lease ownership stores. Our business philosophy has always emphasized strict cost containment and
fiscal controls. Executive and store level management monitor expenses to contain costs. We pay all invoices from company headquarters in order to enhance fiscal accountability. We believe that
careful attention to the expense side of our operations has enabled us to maintain financial stability and profitability.

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Management Information Systems  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use computer-based management information systems to facilitate cash collections, merchandise returns and inventory monitoring. Through the use of proprietary
software we have developed, each of our stores is linked by computer directly to corporate headquarters, which enables us to monitor the performance of each store on a daily basis. Different systems
are used to run the sales and lease ownership and rent-to-rent operations due to the significant differences in the businesses. At the store level, the store manager is better
able to track merchandise on the showroom floor and in the warehouse to minimize delivery times, assist with product purchasing and match customer needs with available inventory. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Rental Agreement Approval, Renewal and Collection  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the keys to the success of our sales and lease ownership operation is our ability to achieve timely cash collections. Individual store managers use our
computerized information system on a daily basis to track cash collections. They contact customers within a few days of when their lease payments
are due in order to encourage customers to keep their agreement current and in force, rather than having to return the merchandise for non-payment, and to renew their agreements for an
additional period. Careful attention to cash collections is particularly important in the sales and lease ownership operations, where the customer typically has the option to cancel the agreement at
any time and each payment is considered a renewal of the agreement rather than a collection of a receivable. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
rent-to-rent store performs a credit check on most of its residential and business customers. We generally perform no formal credit check with respect to
sales and lease ownership customers other than to verify employment or other reliable sources of income and personal references supplied by the customer. All of our agreements for residential and
office merchandise require payments in advance, and the merchandise normally is repossessed if a payment is significantly in arrears. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net
bad debt losses from rent-to-rent rentals as a percentage of rent-to-rent rental revenues were approximately 2.5%, 1.6%, and 2.7% for
the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. We do not extend credit to sales and lease ownership customers. For the same periods, net company-wide merchandise
shrinkage as a percentage of combined rental revenues was 2.2%, 2.2%, and 2.5%, respectively. We believe that our collection and repossession policies comply with applicable legal requirements, and we
discipline any employee that we discover deviating from such policies. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Customer Service  </I></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that customer service is one of the most important elements in the success of our sales and lease ownership and rent-to-rent
businesses. Customer satisfaction is critical because the customer usually has the option of returning the rented merchandise at any time. Our goal is to make our customers feel positive about Aaron
Rents and its products from the moment they enter our showrooms. Items are serviced at no charge to the customer, and quick, free delivery is available in many cases. In order to increase rentals at
existing stores, we foster relationships with existing customers to attract recurring business, and many new rental and lease ownership agreements are attributable to repeat customers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
of the importance of customer service, we believe that a prerequisite for successful operations and growth is skilled, effective employees who value our customers and project a
genuine desire to serve customers' needs. Our Aaron's Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership division has nine training facilities where store managers and employees cover all areas of our operations, with a
heavy emphasis on customer service. We also have a training program we call Aaron's University designed to provide a uniform customer service experience regardless of the store location or whether it
is company-operated or franchised. Standardizing operating procedures throughout our system is a primary focus of Aaron's University. We have a 22-course curriculum for sales and lease
ownership managers. The rent-to-rent

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
purchase the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers, with the balance from local distributors. One of our largest suppliers is our own MacTavish Furniture Industries
division, which supplies nearly one-half of the furniture we rent or sell. We have no long-term agreements for the purchase of merchandise and believe that our relationships
with suppliers are good. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rent-to-rent
stores receive merchandise directly from vendors who ship to the stores' attached warehouses. Sales and lease ownership operations utilize
distribution centers to control merchandise. All company-operated sales and lease ownership stores receive merchandise directly from our 11 distribution centers located in Auburndale, Florida; Dallas
and Sugarland, Texas; Duluth, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Phoenix, Arizona; Carolina, Puerto Rico; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Madison, Tennessee. We
opened our 12<SUP>th</SUP> distribution center in January&nbsp;2004 in Magnolia, Mississippi, and plan to open several more distribution centers in 2004. Most of our stores are within a
250-mile radius of a distribution center, assuring timely shipment of supplies to the stores and fast delivery of orders to customers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales
and lease ownership stores typically have smaller warehouses with less merchandise storage space than our rent-to-rent stores. Vendors normally ship
directly to the distribution centers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
realize freight savings from truckload discounts and more efficient distribution of merchandise by using distribution centers. We use our own tractor-trailers, local delivery trucks,
and various contract carriers to make weekly deliveries to individual stores. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Competition  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Rents' businesses are highly competitive. We compete in the rent-to-own and credit retail markets. Our two largest competitors in
the rent-to-own market are Rent-A-Center,&nbsp;Inc. and Rent-Way,&nbsp;Inc. We also compete in the rent-to-rent
market with national and local companies and, to a lesser extent, with apartment owners who purchase furniture for rental to tenants. We believe that CORT Business Services Corporation is our most
significant rent-to-rent competitor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
definitive industry statistics are not available, we believe that Aaron Rents is one of the largest furniture rental companies in the United States. We also believe that we
generally have a

favorable competitive position in that industry because of our manufacturing capabilities, prompt delivery, competitive pricing, brand recognition and commitment to customer service. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Government Regulation  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that 47 states specifically regulate rent-to-own transactions, including states in which we currently operate Aaron's
Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership stores. Most of these states have enacted disclosure laws which require rent-to-own companies to disclose to their customers the total number of
payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed by them and miscellaneous other items. The most restrictive states limit the
total amount that a customer may be charged for an item to twice the "retail" price for the item, or regulate the amount of "interest" that rent-to-own companies may charge on
rent-to-own transactions, generally defining "interest" as rental fees paid in excess of the "retail" price of the goods. Our long-established policy in all states
is to disclose the terms of our rental purchase transactions as a matter of good business ethics and customer service. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the rent-to-own industry. Federal legislation has been proposed from time to time to regulate the
industry, and bills supported by the rent-to-own industry group are currently under consideration in both houses of Congress. We cannot predict whether any such legislation
will be enacted and what the impact of such legislation would be on us. Although we are unable to predict the
results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe that existing and proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our sales and lease ownership or other operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
sales and lease ownership store franchise program is subject to Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises.
Several state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise offering circular containing
prescribed information. A number of states in which we might consider franchising also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of the franchise offering circular with state
authorities. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable franchise laws. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Employees  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2003, Aaron Rents had approximately 5,400 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe
that our relations with our employees are good. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Information on Segments and Geographic Areas  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently only operate in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. Information on our four reportable segments&#151;sales and lease ownership,

<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS    <BR>    </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain written and oral statements made by our company may constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995, including statements made in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Generally, the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "intend", "estimate,"
"project," "will," and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. All statements which address operating performance, events or developments
that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future including growth in store openings and franchises awarded, market share, and statements expressing general optimism about future operating results
are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's historical experience
and the company's present expectations or projections. As and when made, management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, caution should be taken not to place undue
reliance on any such forward-looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For a discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties see the following risk factors: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our growth strategy depends on opening new company-operated stores. Our ability to expand our store base is influenced by factors beyond our control, which may impair our
growth strategy and impede our revenue growth.  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening new company-operated stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Our ability to continue opening new stores depends, among other things, upon our
ability to: </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we cannot address these challenges successfully, we may not be able to expand our business at the rate we currently contemplate, or increase our revenues. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>If we cannot manage the costs of opening new stores, our profitability may be hurt.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of 2002, we added a net of 136 company-operated sales and lease ownership stores. Opening large numbers of new stores requires significant
start-up expenses, and new stores are often not profitable until their second year of operation. Consequently, opening many stores over a short period can materially decrease our net
earnings for a time. This effect is sometimes called "new store drag." During 2003, we estimate that start-up expenses for new stores reduced our pre-tax earnings by
approximately $6&nbsp;million, or $.19 per diluted share. We cannot be certain that we will be able to fully recover these significant costs in the future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>If we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner, our profitability may
decrease.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are unable to integrate businesses successfully, we may incur substantial cost and delays in increasing our customer base. In addition, the failure to
integrate acquisitions successfully may divert management's attention from Aaron Rents' existing business. Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in an
unfamiliar market, or a business with a different management philosophy or operating style.

<A NAME="page_di1142_1_14"> </A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our competitors could impede our ability to attract new customers, or attract current customers away from us.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our businesses are highly competitive. In the sales and lease ownership market, our competitors include national, regional and local operators of
rent-to-own stores and credit retailers. We compete in the rent-to-rent market with national and
local companies and, to a lesser extent, with apartment owners who purchase furniture for rental to tenants. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and operating resources, and
in certain markets, greater name recognition, than us. Greater financial resources may allow our competitors to grow faster than us, including through acquisitions. This in turn may allow them to
enter new markets before we can, which may decrease our opportunities in those markets. Greater name recognition, or better public perception of a competitor's reputation, may help them attract market
share away from us, even in our established markets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Because our rent-to-rent division is dependent on business customers, slowdowns in corporate spending may decrease our revenues.  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rent-to-rent division depends on business customers for a significant percentage of its rental revenues. Because businesses are likely
to curb spending during economic downturns, the revenues of our rent-to-rent business may be adversely affected during these periods. Revenues from our
rent-to-rent division decreased 9.3% in 2003 compared with 2002 revenues. We cannot be certain that revenues from our rent-to-rent division will
increase in the future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>We may not be able to attract qualified franchisees, which may slow the growth of our business.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our franchisees developing new franchised sales and lease ownership stores. We generally seek franchisees who meet
our stringent business background and financial criteria, and who are willing to enter into area development agreements for several stores. A number of factors, however, could inhibit our ability to
find qualified franchisees, including general economic downturns, or legislative or litigation developments that make the rent-to-own industry less attractive to potential
franchisees. These developments could also adversely affect our franchisees' ability to obtain adequate capital to develop and operate new stores on time, or at all. Our inability to find qualified
franchisees could slow our growth. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified
franchisees who can conform to our standards and requirements are also important to the overall success of our business. Our franchisees, however, are independent contractors
and not employees, and consequently we cannot control them to the same extent as our company-operated stores. Our franchisees may fail in key areas, which could in turn slow our growth, reduce our
franchise revenues and systemwide revenues, or damage our image and reputation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>We are subject to laws that regulate franchisor-franchisee relationships. Our ability to develop new franchised stores and enforce our rights against franchisees may be
adversely affected by these laws, which could impair our growth strategy and cause our franchise revenues to decline.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a franchisor, we are subject to both regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Because we plan to
expand our business partly by selling more franchises, our failure to obtain or maintain approvals to sell franchises could significantly impede our growth strategy. In addition, our failure to comply
with franchise regulations could cause us to lose franchise fee and ongoing royalty revenues. Moreover, state laws that regulate substantive aspects of our relationships with franchisees may limit our
ability to terminate or otherwise resolve conflicts with our franchisees.
<!-- ZEQ.=2,SEQ=15,EFW="2130820",CP="AARON RENTS, INC.",DN="1",CHK=781301,FOLIO='14',FILE='DISK027:[04ATA2.04ATA1142]DI1142A.;4',USER='SSTANSE',CD='12-MAR-2004;14:43' -->
<A NAME="page_di1142_1_15"> </A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Our sales and lease ownership operations are subject to considerable government regulation. Adverse changes in these laws could expose us to significant compliance costs or
burdens or expose us to material litigation, which could leave us liable for a significant judgment or force us to change our business.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that 47 states specifically regulate rent-to-own transactions, including states in which we currently operate Aaron's
Sales&nbsp;&amp; Lease Ownership stores. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the rent-to-own industry, although federal legislation has been proposed from
time to time to regulate the industry and industry-supported bills are currently under consideration in both houses of Congress. Any adverse changes in existing laws, or the passage of new adverse
legislation by the states or the federal government, could materially increase both our costs of complying with laws and the risk that we could be sued or be subject to government sanctions if we are
not in compliance. In addition, new burdensome legislation might force us to change our business model, and might render our sales and lease ownership operations a less desirable business to engage
in. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
of the states that regulate rent-to-own transactions have enacted disclosure laws which require rent-to-own companies to disclose to
their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed by them and miscellaneous other items. The
most restrictive states limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item to twice the "retail" price for the item, or regulate the amount of "interest" that
rent-to-own companies may charge on rent-to-own transactions, generally defining "interest" as rental fees paid in excess of the "retail" price of the
goods. We cannot guarantee that the federal government or states will not enact additional or different legislation that would be disadvantageous to us. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to the risk of lawsuits related to the disclosure laws that regulate rent-to-own transactions, we could be subject to lawsuits alleging violations of
state laws and regulations and consumer tort law, including fraud and consumer protection laws because of the consumer-oriented nature of the rent-to-own industry and the
currently applicable laws. A large judgment could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, an adverse outcome from a lawsuit, even one against one of our
competitors instead of against us, could result in changes in the way we and others in the industry do business, which may involve significant costs or decreased revenues or profitability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Any loss of the services of our key executives, or our inability to attract and retain qualified managers, could have a material adverse impact on our operations.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that we have benefited substantially from Mr.&nbsp;Loudermilk's leadership, and that the loss of his services at any time in the near future could
adversely affect our business and operations. We are also dependent on the continued services of the rest of our management team, including our key executives. The loss of these individuals without
adequate replacement could also adversely affect our business. Although we have employment agreements with some of our key executives, they are generally terminable on short notice and we do not carry
key man life insurance on any of our officers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
we need a growing number of qualified managers to operate our stores successfully. If we were unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so
increase significantly, our operations would be materially adversely affected. </FONT></P>

contain renewal options for additional periods ranging from one to fifteen years at rental rates generally adjusted on the basis of the consumer price index or other factors.
