</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain written and oral statements made by Aaron Rents, Inc. may constitute &#147;forward-looking
statements&#148; as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including
statements made in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Generally, the words &#147;anticipate,&#148; &#147;believe,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;intend&#148;, &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; and
similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in
nature. All statements which address operating performance, events or developments that we expect
or anticipate will occur in the future including growth in store openings and franchises awarded,
market share, and statements expressing general optimism about future operating results are
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company&#146;s historical
experience and the company&#146;s present expectations or projections. Caution should be taken not to
place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements since such statements speak only as of
the date when made. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. For
a discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties, see the section of this report entitled
&#147;Risk Factors.&#148;

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Rents, Inc. is a leading U.S. company engaged in the combined businesses of the lease
ownership, rental and specialty retailing of consumer electronics, residential and office
furniture, household appliances, and accessories, with 1,198 stores, including both our
company-operated and independently-owned franchised stores, in 46 states, Puerto Rico and Canada as
of December&nbsp;31, 2005. Our major operating divisions are the Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership
division, the Aaron Rents&#146; Corporate Furnishings division (previously known as the Aaron Rents&#146;
Rent-to-Rent division), and the MacTavish Furniture Industries division, which supplies nearly
one-half of the furniture and related accessories leased and sold in our stores. Our strategic
focus is on expanding our higher growth sales and lease ownership business through opening new
company-operated stores, expanding our franchise program, and making selective acquisitions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At December&nbsp;31, 2005, we had 1,140 sales and lease ownership stores, including 748
company-operated stores in 27 states and Puerto Rico and 392 franchised stores in 46 states and
Canada. There were also 58 corporate furnishings stores in our corporate furnishings division in
14 states at December&nbsp;31, 2005. Revenues from our sales and lease ownership division (which
includes revenues from franchisees) accounted for 89%, 88%, and 86%, of our total revenues in 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, R. Charles Loudermilk, Sr., established Aaron Rents
in 1955, and we were incorporated under the laws of Georgia in 1962.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An overview of our three divisions follows.

durable household goods to lower to middle income consumers who have limited or no access to
traditional credit sources such as bank financing, installment credit or credit cards. Our sales
and lease ownership program enables these customers to obtain quality-of-life enhancing merchandise
that they might otherwise not be able to afford without incurring additional debt or long-term
obligations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We franchise our sales and lease ownership stores in select markets where we have no immediate
plans to enter. We believe that our franchise program:

leading to the improved 2004 earnings results despite nearly unchanged revenues. Revenues and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>The Rent-to-Own Industry</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent-to-own industry, a growing segment of the retail industry, offers an alternative to
traditional methods of obtaining furniture, electronics, and appliances. According to industry
sources, there are approximately 8,300 rent-to-own stores in the United States. Annual
industry-wide revenues are believed to be approximately $6.6&nbsp;billion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a typical rent-to-own transaction, the customer has the option to acquire merchandise over
a fixed term, usually 12 to 24&nbsp;months, normally by making weekly rental payments. The customer may
cancel the agreement at any time by returning the merchandise to the store, with no further rental
obligation. If the customer rents the item to the full term, he obtains ownership of the item,
though he can choose to buy it at any time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent-to-own concept is particularly popular with consumers who cannot pay the full
purchase price for merchandise at once or who lack the credit to qualify under conventional
financing programs. It is also popular with consumers who, despite good credit, do not wish to
incur additional debt, have only a temporary need for the merchandise or want to try out a
particular brand or model before buying it.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our sales and lease ownership model is unique. By providing customers with the
option either to purchase merchandise outright or lease merchandise with the opportunity to obtain
ownership, we blend elements of rent-to-own and traditional retailing. We enable cash or
credit-constrained customers to obtain quality-of-life enhancing merchandise that they otherwise
might not be able to afford without incurring additional debt or long-term obligations. In addition
to these core customers, our concept is also popular with consumers who have only a temporary need
for the merchandise or want to try out a particular brand or model before purchase. We believe our
sales and lease ownership program is a more effective method of retailing our merchandise to lower
to middle income consumers than a typical rent-to-own business or the more traditional method of
credit installment sales.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales and lease ownership model is also distinctive from a typical rent-to-own business in

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales and lease ownership model also has attractive features in common with traditional
retailers. We offer an up-front &#147;cash and carry&#148; purchase option on select merchandise at prices
that are competitive with discount and/or traditional retailers. Our merchandise selection and
store size are more typical of traditional retailers. However, unlike most traditional retailers,
our sales and lease ownership transactions are not credit installment contracts.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furniture component of the rent-to-rent industry is believed to be greater than $600
million in annual rental revenues. The demand for rental products is believed to be related to the
mobility of the population, which relies upon rented merchandise to meet temporary needs. The
industry is highly competitive and has consolidated, with only a handful of companies accounting
for a substantial share of the market.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent-to-rent industry serves both individual and business customers who generally have

success of our sales and lease ownership operation is attributable to our distinctive
approach to the business that sets us apart from our rent-to-own and credit retail
competitors. We have pioneered innovative approaches to meeting changing customer needs
that differ from our competitors&#146;, such as offering lease ownership agreements which result
in a lower &#147;all-in&#148; price, larger and more attractive store showrooms, a wider selection of
higher-quality merchandise and up-front cash and carry purchase options on select
merchandise at prices that are competitive with traditional retailers. Most sales and
lease ownership customers make their payments in person, and we use these frequent visits
to strengthen customer relationships and make sales and lease ownership customers feel
welcome in our stores.

relationships with our customers to attract recurring business and encourage them to rent
merchandise for the full agreement term by providing high levels of service and
satisfaction. Aaron Rents demonstrates its commitment to superior customer service by
providing customers quick delivery of rented merchandise, in many cases by same or next day
delivery, and repair service at no charge to the customer. We have also established an
employee training program called Aaron&#146;s University, which is a 30-course curriculum
designed to enhance the customer relations skills of both company-operated and franchised
store managers.

the prime customer base for our products, such as our &#147;Dream Products&#148; merchandise, which
we advertise through our &#147;Drive Dreams Home&#148; sponsorship of NASCAR championship racing.
Sponsorship of other sporting events also reaches this market. We typically distribute
mass mailings of promotional material outlining specific products every two weeks, with the
goal of reaching households within a specified radius of each store at least 24 times per
year. We currently mail about 20&nbsp;million flyers monthly nationwide. We also utilize local
television and radio advertising in concentrated geographic markets and for special
promotions.

increase revenues in our existing corporate furnishings stores, particularly in the
business sector, while managing that division&#146;s costs and expenses to make best use of its
net earnings and cash flow for the development of our higher-growth operations. We believe
that our ability to deliver furniture and equipment to our business customers quickly and
efficiently gives us an advantage over general furniture retailers who often require
several weeks to deliver comparable merchandise. In addition, we locate warehouses next to
each showroom, enabling store managers to exercise greater control over inventory,
merchandise condition, and pickup and deliveries. This results in more efficient and
consistent customer service. Revenues in the corporate furnishings business stabilized as
the economy began to recover in 2004, and earnings improved as our measures to improve
profitability in reaction to the decline in the business in previous years took effect. We
believe that our corporate furnishings business will continue to provide us with cash flow
to finance a portion of the planned expansion of the sales and lease ownership division.
In addition, we believe that continued economic expansion may provide growth opportunities
in the corporate furnishings market, particularly in the business sector.

enables us to control the quality, cost, styling, durability and quantity of a substantial
portion of our rental furniture merchandise, and provides us a reliable source of
furniture. Our distribution system allows us to deliver merchandise promptly to our stores
and manage inventory levels more efficiently. We plan to open several more fulfillment

strategies are to:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 5%"><B>&#149;</B> <B><I>Open additional company-operated sales and lease ownership stores. </I></B>Our strategy
is to open sales and lease ownership stores in existing and select new geographic markets
where we can cluster stores to realize economies of scale in marketing and distribution and
other operating efficiencies. In accordance with this strategy we added 132
company-operated store locations in 2005.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 5%"><B>&#149;</B> <B><I>Increase revenues and net earnings from existing sales and lease ownership stores. </I></B>We
experienced same store revenue growth of 8.3% in 2005, 11.6% in 2004, and 10.1% in 2003.
We calculate same store revenue growth by comparing revenues from consecutive years for all
stores open for that entire 24-month period, excluding stores that received rental
agreements from other acquired, closed, or merged stores. We expect revenues and net
earnings of our sales and lease ownership division to continue to grow as the large number
of stores opened in the past few years mature.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 5%"><B>&#149;</B> <B><I>Seek acquisitions in both new and existing sales and lease ownership markets.</I></B>
We will continue to explore acquisitions of other rent-to-own operations as another avenue
of growth. In 2005, we added 96 sales and lease ownership locations through acquisitions.
Some of these locations were subsequently merged with existing locations to achieve fixed
cost leverage.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 5%"><B>&#149;</B> <B><I>Award additional sales and lease ownership franchises. </I></B>We believe that our
franchise program allows us to grow more quickly and increase our brand exposure in new
markets. In addition, the combination of company-operated and franchised stores creates a
larger store base that enhances the economies of scale in purchasing, manufacturing, and
advertising for our sales and lease ownership stores. Franchise fees and royalties also
represent a growing source of company revenues. In 2005, we added 71 franchise locations
and had a pipeline at year-end 2005 of 272 stores scheduled to open over the next few
years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We established our Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership operation in 1987. At December&nbsp;31, 2005,
we had 748 company-operated sales and lease ownership stores in 27 states and Puerto Rico, and 392
franchised sales and lease ownership stores in 46 states and Canada. We believe that the decline
in the number of furniture stores that focus on credit installment sales to lower to middle income
consumers has created a market opportunity for our unique sales and lease ownership concept. The
traditional retail consumer durable goods market is much larger than the rental market, leaving
substantial potential for growth for our sales and lease ownership division. We believe that the
segment of the population targeted by our sales and lease ownership division comprises over 40% of
all households in the United States and that the needs of these consumers are generally
underserved.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed a distinctive concept for our sales and lease ownership stores with specific
merchandising selection and store layout, pricing, and agreement terms for our target customer
market. We believe that these features create a store and a sales and lease ownership concept
significantly different from the operations of rent-to-own stores, our traditional corporate
furnishings (rent-to-rent) business, and the operations of home furnishings retailers who finance
merchandise.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The typical Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership store layout is a combination showroom and
warehouse of 8,000 to 10,000 square feet, with an average of approximately 9,000 total square feet.
In selecting locations for new sales and lease ownership stores, we generally look for sites in
well-maintained strip shopping centers with good access strategically located within ten miles of
established working class neighborhoods and communities. We also build to suit stand alone stores
in certain markets. Many of our stores are placed near existing competitors&#146; stores. Each sales
and lease ownership store usually maintains at least two trucks and crews for pickups and
deliveries, and generally offers same or next day delivery for addresses located within ten miles
of the store. We emphasize a broad selection of brand name products for our electronics, including
computers, and appliance items, and offer customers a wide selection of furniture, including
furniture manufactured by our MacTavish Furniture Industries division. Our sales and lease
ownership stores also offer lawn tractors and jewelry.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that our sales and lease ownership stores offer lower merchandise prices than
similar items offered by rent-to-own operators, and substantially equivalent to the &#147;all-in&#148;
contract price of similar items offered by home furnishings retailers who finance merchandise.
Approximately 75% of our sales and lease ownership agreements are monthly as compared to the
industry standard of weekly agreements, and our agreements usually provide for a shorter term
leading to customer ownership. Customers can have the item serviced free of charge or replaced at
any time during the rental agreement. Merchandise from the agreements that do not go to term is
either re-rented or sold. We also offer, for select merchandise, an up-front cash and carry
purchase option at prices that are competitive with discount and/or traditional retailers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the later part of 2004 we opened two experimental stores under the RIMCO name that
lease automobile tires and rims to customers under sales and lease ownership agreements. Although
the products offered are different, these stores are managed, monitored, and operated similar to
our other sales and lease ownership stores. At December&nbsp;31, 2005 we had nine RIMCO stores open and
expect to moderately expand this business in 2006 thorough the opening of additional
Company-operated stores as well as the opening of several franchised stores.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We began franchising Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership stores in select markets in 1992 and have
continued to attract franchisees. We do not anticipate that franchised stores will compete with
company-operated stores, as we mainly award franchises in markets where we have no operations and
no current plans to enter. As of December&nbsp;31, 2005, we have 392 franchise stores open and area
development agreements with franchisees to open 272 stores in the future. We believe that our
relations with our franchisees are good.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant&#146;s business background and financial
resources. We generally seek franchisees who will enter into area development agreements for
several stores, although many franchisees currently operate a single store. Most franchisees are
involved in the day-to-day operations of the stores.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enter into franchise agreements with our franchisees to govern the opening and operation of
franchised stores. Under our current standard agreement, we require the franchisee to pay a
franchise fee of $50,000 per store. Agreements are for a term of ten years, with one ten-year
renewal option, and franchisees are obligated to remit to us royalty payments to us of 5% of the
franchisee&#146;s weekly cash collections. The royalty payments increased to 6% for all franchise

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We assist each franchisee in selecting the proper site for each store. Because of the
importance of location to the Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership concept, one of our pre-opening
directors visits the intended market and helps guide the franchisee through the selection process.
Once a site is selected, we help in designing the floor plan, including the proper layout of the
showroom and warehouse. In addition, we provide assistance in assuring that the design and decor of
the showroom is consistent with our

pre-opening advertising, ordering initial inventory and obtaining delivery vehicles.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an arrangement with several banks to provide financing to qualifying franchisees to
assist with establishing and operating their stores. An inventory financing plan to provide
franchisees with the capital to purchase inventory is the primary component of the financing
program. For qualified established franchisees, we have arranged in some cases for these
institutions to provide a revolving credit line to allow franchisees the flexibility to expand. We
guarantee amounts outstanding under the franchisee financing programs.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All franchisees are required to complete a comprehensive training program and to operate their
franchised sales and lease ownership stores in compliance with our policies, standards and
specifications, including such matters as decor, rental agreement terms, hours of operation,
pricing and merchandise. Franchisees in general are not required to purchase their rental
merchandise from our fulfillment centers, although most do so in order to take advantage of Company
sponsored financing, bulk purchasing discounts, and favorable delivery terms. Several franchisees
also purchase their rental furniture directly from our MacTavish Furniture Industries division.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We conduct a financial audit of our franchise stores every six to 12&nbsp;months and also conduct
regular operational audits&#151;generally visiting each franchise store almost as often as we visit our
company-operated stores. In addition, our proprietary management information system links each
franchised store to corporate headquarters.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been in the rent-to-rent business for over 50&nbsp;years and believe we are the second
largest furniture corporate furnishings (rent-to-rent) company in the United States. Our corporate
furnishings business accounted for approximately 11% of total revenues in 2005, 12% for 2004, and
14% for 2003. We rent new and rental return merchandise to both individuals and businesses, with a
growing focus on renting residential and office furniture to business customers. As of December
31, 2005, we operated 58 corporate furnishings stores in 14 states.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our typical corporate furnishings store layout consists of a combination showroom and
warehouse comprising about 19,000 square feet. Each residential showroom features attractive
displays of dining room, living room and bedroom furniture in a number of styles, fabrics,
materials and colors. Office rental showrooms feature lines of desks, chairs, conference tables,
credenzas, sofas and accessories. We believe that locating a warehouse next to each showroom
permits store managers to exercise greater control over inventory, merchandise condition, and
pickup and deliveries, resulting in more efficient and consistent service for the customer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items held for rent, whether new or rental return, are available for purchase and lease
purchase at all corporate furnishings stores. Each corporate furnishings store generally offers
next day delivery for addresses located within 50 miles of the store, and maintains at least one
truck and a crew for pickups and deliveries. We believe that our ability to obtain and deliver
furniture and equipment to customers quickly and efficiently gives us an advantage over general
furniture retailers who often require several weeks to effect delivery.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We generally sell rental return merchandise at stores at or above its book value&#151;that is, cost
less depreciation, plus selling expenses&#151;a price which is usually lower than the price for
comparable new merchandise. Most merchandise held for sale in stores may also be acquired through
a lease purchase option. Because new merchandise is sold at the same location as rental return
merchandise, we have the opportunity to sell both new and rental return merchandise to customers
who may have been attracted to the store by the advertising and price appeal of rental return
merchandise. The ability to sell new and rental return merchandise at the same location allows for more efficient use of facilities and personnel
and minimizes overhead.

us more flexibility in scheduling production runs and in meeting inventory needs than

Superspeedway consisting of the Aaron&#146;s 499 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series&nbsp;Race and the Aaron&#146;s 312
NASCAR Busch Series&nbsp;Race. Both races are broadcast live on FOX television and are among the most
watched NASCAR events on the schedule.

races.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we have a league sponsorship of the Arena Football League, which is broadcast
nationally on NBC and regionally, Fox Sports Net (FSN)&nbsp;and the Outdoor Life Network (OLN). This
sponsorship includes uniform patches on all visiting teams&#146; jerseys, arena signage and local
promotions throughout the country. National in-store sweepstakes for a trip for two to the
ArenaBowl in Las Vegas helps drive these arena football fans into Aaron&#146;s locations around the
country.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sports partnerships are integrated into advertising, promotional and marketing

programs targeting corporate customers. In addition, the division has a national accounts program
that develops strategic partnerships to service clients&#146; nationwide needs. As an example, the
corporate furnishings division has developed an alliance with a larger trailer company to handle
all of the short term furnishings for trailers used at NASCAR races and has been a sponsor in the
Tour de Georgia professional cycling racing program. We also rely on the use of brochures,
newspapers, radio, television, direct mail, trade publications, yellow pages, and the internet
(<I>http://www.aaronrents.com; www.aaronrentsfurniture.com; www.shopaarons.com</I>, which information is

company-operated sales and lease ownership stores several times each year, and semi-annual audits
of corporate furnishings stores and franchised sales and lease ownership stores. Our business
philosophy has always emphasized safeguarding of company assets, strict cost containment and fiscal
controls. Executive and store level management monitor expenses to contain costs. We pay all
invoices from company headquarters in order to enhance fiscal accountability. We believe that
careful attention to the safeguarding of rental merchandise, our most significant asset, as well as
expense side of our operations has enabled us to maintain financial stability and profitability.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Management Information Systems</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use computer-based management information systems to facilitate cash collections,
merchandise returns and inventory monitoring. Through the use of proprietary software developed
in-house, each of our stores is linked by computer directly to corporate headquarters, which
enables us to monitor the performance of each store on a daily basis. Different systems are used
to run the sales and lease ownership and corporate furnishings operations due to the significant
differences in the businesses. At the store level, the store manager is better able to track
merchandise on the showroom floor and in the warehouse to minimize delivery times, assist with
product purchasing, and match customer needs with available inventory.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Rental Agreement Approval, Renewal and Collection</I>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the keys to the success of our sales and lease ownership operation is timely cash
collections. Individual store managers use our computerized information system on a daily basis to
track cash collections. They contact customers within a few days of when their lease payments are
due in order to encourage customers to keep their agreement current and in force, rather than
having to return the merchandise for non-payment, and to renew their agreements for an additional
period. Careful attention to cash collections is particularly important in the sales and lease
ownership operations, where the customer typically has the option to cancel the agreement at any
time and each payment is considered a renewal of the agreement rather than a collection of a
receivable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each corporate furnishings store performs a credit check on most of its residential and

ownership customers, other than to verify employment or other reliable sources of income and
personal references supplied by the customer. All of our agreements for residential and office
merchandise require payments in advance, and the merchandise normally is repossessed if a payment
is significantly in arrears.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that customer service is one of the most important elements in the success of our
sales and lease ownership and corporate furnishings businesses. Customer satisfaction is critical
because the customer typically has the option of returning the rented merchandise at any time. Our
goal is to make our customers feel positive about Aaron Rents and our products from the moment they
enter our showrooms. Items are serviced at no charge to the customer, and quick, free delivery is
available in many cases. In order to increase rentals at existing stores, we foster relationships
with existing customers to attract recurring business, and many new rental and lease ownership
agreements are attributable to repeat customers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the importance of customer service, we believe that a prerequisite for successful
operations and growth is skilled, effective employees who value our customers and project a genuine
desire to serve customers&#146; needs. Our Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership division has 41 training
facilities where store managers and employees learn and review all areas of our operations, with a
heavy emphasis on customer service. We also have a training program we call Aaron&#146;s University
designed to provide a uniform customer service experience regardless of the store location, whether
company-operated or franchised. Standardizing operating procedures throughout our system is a
primary focus of Aaron&#146;s University. We have a 30-course curriculum for sales and lease ownership
managers. The corporate furnishings division&#146;s sales and management training programs have similar
training conducted at our Atlanta headquarters. Our policy of promoting from within boosts
employee retention and underscores our commitment to customer service and other business
philosophies, allowing us to realize greater benefits from our employee training programs.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our product mix is determined by store managers in consultation with regional managers and
regional vice presidents, based on an analysis of customer demands. In our corporate furnishings
division, furniture is the primary merchandise category, accounting for approximately 93% of
corporate furnishings revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2005.

retail markets. Our two largest competitors in the rent-to-own market are Rent-A-Center, Inc. and
Rent-Way, Inc. We also compete in the rent-to-rent market with national and local companies and, to
a lesser extent, with apartment owners who purchase or provide furniture for rental to tenants.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although definitive industry statistics are not available, we believe that Aaron

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Government Regulation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operations are extensively regulated by and subject to the requirements and restraints of
various federal and state laws and regulations. In general such laws regulate applications for
leases, late fees, other finance rates, the form of disclosure statements, the substance and
sequence of required disclosures, the content of advertising materials, and certain collection
procedures. Violations of certain provisions of these laws may result in penalties ranging from
nominal amounts up to and including forfeiture of fees and other amounts due on leases. We do not
believe that the various laws and regulations have had or will have a material adverse effect on
our operations. However, we are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or
earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future
interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and
there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material
adverse effect on our operations and earnings.

regulating our operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that 47 states specifically regulate rent-to-own transactions, including states in
which we currently operate Aaron&#146;s Sales &#038; Lease Ownership stores. Most of state rental purchase
laws require rent-to-own companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments,
total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that
may be imposed, and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state rental purchase laws
limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the amount of deemed
&#147;interest&#148; that rent-to-own companies may charge on rent-to-own transactions, generally defining
&#147;interest&#148; as rental fees paid in excess of the &#147;retail&#148; price of the goods. Our long-established
policy in all states is to disclose the terms of our rental purchase transactions as a matter of
good business ethics and customer service. We believe we are in material compliance with the
various state rental purchase laws.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the rent-to-own industry. Federal
legislation to regulate the industry has been proposed from time to time. We cannot predict
whether any such legislation will be enacted and what the impact of such legislation would be on
us. Although we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe
that existing and proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our sales and lease
ownership or other operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced a form of consumer lease as an alternative to our typical rental purchase
agreement in a number of states. The consumer lease differs from a rental purchase agreement in
that it has an initial lease term in excess of four months. Generally, state laws that govern the
rent-to-own industry only apply to lease agreements with an initial term of four months or less.
The consumer lease is governed by federal and state laws and regulations other than the state
rental purchase laws. The federal regulations applicable to the consumer lease require certain
disclosures similar to the rent-to-own regulations, but are generally less restrictive as to
pricing and other charges. We believe we are in material compliance with all laws applicable to
our consumer leasing program.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales and lease ownership store franchise program is subject to Federal Trade Commission
(&#147;FTC&#148;) regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several
state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC
requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise offering circular containing
prescribed information. A number of states in which we might consider franchising also regulate
the sale of franchises and require registration of the franchise offering circular with state
authorities. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable franchise laws.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We may not be able to attract qualified franchisees, which may slow the growth of our business.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our growth strategy is considerably dependent upon our franchisees developing new franchised
sales and lease ownership stores. We generally seek franchisees who meet our stringent business
background and financial criteria, and who are willing to enter into area development agreements
for several stores. A number of factors, however, could inhibit our ability to find qualified
franchisees, including general economic downturns or legislative or litigation developments that
make the rent-to-own industry less attractive to potential franchisees. These developments could
also adversely affect our franchisees&#146; ability to obtain adequate capital to develop and operate
new stores on time, or at all. Our inability to find qualified franchisees could slow our growth.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified franchisees who conform to our standards and requirements are also important to the
overall success of our business. Our franchisees, however, are independent contractors and not
employees, and consequently we cannot control them to the same extent as our company-operated
stores. Our franchisees may fail in key areas, which could in turn slow our growth, reduce our
franchise revenues, or damage our image and reputation.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>If we cannot manage the costs of opening new stores, our profitability may suffer.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of 2004, we added a net of 248 company-operated sales and lease ownership
stores. Opening large numbers of new stores requires significant start-up expenses, and new stores
are often not profitable until their second year of operation. Consequently, opening many stores
over a short period can materially decrease our net earnings for a time. This effect is sometimes
called &#147;new store drag.&#148; During 2005, we estimate that start-up expenses for new stores reduced
our pre-tax earnings by approximately $8&nbsp;million, or $.16 per diluted share. We cannot be certain
that we will be able to fully recover these significant costs in the future.

lesser extent, with apartment owners who purchase or provide furniture for rental to tenants. Some
of our competitors have significantly greater financial and operating resources, and greater name

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that we have benefited substantially from Mr.&nbsp;Loudermilk, Sr.&#146;s leadership and that
the loss of his services at any time in the near future could adversely affect our business and
operations. We are also dependent on the continued services of the rest of our management team,
including key executives. The loss of these individuals without adequate replacement could also
adversely affect our business. Although we have employment agreements with some of our key
executives, they are generally terminable on short notice and we do not carry key man life
insurance on any of our officers.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, we need a growing number of qualified managers to operate our stores

costs of complying with laws and the risk that we could be sued or be subject to government
sanctions if we are not in compliance. In addition, new burdensome legislation might force us to

operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the risk of lawsuits related to the laws that regulate rent-to-own and consumer
lease transactions, we could be subject to lawsuits alleging violations of state laws and
regulations and consumer tort law, including fraud and consumer protection laws because of the
consumer-oriented nature of the rent-to-own industry. A large judgment could adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, an adverse outcome from a lawsuit, even
one against one of our competitors, could result in changes in the way we and others in the
industry do business, possibly leading to significant costs or decreased revenues or profitability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>We are subject to laws that regulate franchisor-franchisee relationships. Our ability to
develop new franchised stores and enforce our rights against franchisees may be adversely affected
by these laws, which could impair our growth strategy and cause our franchise revenues to decline.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a franchisor, we are subject to both regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and state
laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Because we plan to expand our business in part
by selling more franchises, our failure to obtain or maintain approvals to sell franchises could
significantly impair our growth strategy. In addition, our failure to comply with franchise
regulations could cause us to lose franchise fees and ongoing royalty revenues. Moreover, state
laws that regulate substantive aspects of our relationships with franchisees may limit our ability
to terminate or otherwise resolve conflicts with our franchisees.
