<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are a specialty pharmaceutical company that is developing and commercializing, either on our own or in partnerships with third parties, new
applications of proven therapeutics to address important unmet medical needs using both proven and new drug delivery technologies. We have developed and are continuing to develop pharmaceutical products aimed principally in the areas of pain
management and addiction. We were incorporated in the State of Indiana in 1997 and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2002. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In formulating our products and product candidates, we utilize the novel, patent protected and proprietary <I>BioErodible MucoAdhesive
(&#147;BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP><SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&#148;</SUP>) </I>drug delivery technology, a small, erodible polymer film for application to the buccal mucosa (the lining inside
the cheek). Our first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (which we refer to as the FDA) approved product, ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (fentanyl buccal soluble film), as well as other product candidates, including
BUNAVAIL&#153;, utilize our BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have worked with other delivery
technologies in the past, and as part of our corporate growth strategy, we may seek to acquire or license additional drug delivery technologies or drugs utilizing the delivery or other technologies of other companies. Clonidine Topical Gel, which
was licensed from Arcion Therapeutics (or Arcion) in 2013, does not utilize the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology and allowed us to diversify our portfolio while maintaining a focus in pain and addiction. As
we gain access to such technologies, we seek to formulate these technologies with proven, FDA approved therapeutics and utilize our development and commercialization experience to, either by ourselves or through partnerships, navigate the resulting
products through the regulatory review process and ultimately bring them to the marketplace. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our current development strategy focuses
primarily on our ability to utilize the FDA&#146;s 505(b)(2) approval process to obtain more timely and efficient approval of new formulations of previously approved, active therapeutics incorporated into our drug delivery technology. Because the
505(b)(2) approval process is designed to address new formulations of previously approved drugs, we believe it has the potential to be more cost efficient and expeditious and have less regulatory approval risk than other FDA approval approaches.

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid agonist and a potential treatment for
moderate to severe chronic pain. In December 2009, we announced that the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a range of doses of
BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine. Completion of this Phase 2 study led to the initiation of a Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study which was initiated in the fourth quarter
of 2010. On September&nbsp;28, 2011, we announced the preliminary findings of our randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical study of BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine for the treatment of moderate to
severe chronic pain in a mixed opioid na&iuml;ve and opioid experienced population. The primary endpoint of the study, overall pain intensity difference between BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine and
placebo, was not achieved. Following full analysis of the data, we concluded that we encountered a high placebo response in the opioid na&iuml;ve segment of the patient population, particularly at our starting dose, which we believe accounted for
the lack of statistically significant efficacy that was observed in the trial overall. We believe this is an occurrence typical of many pain trials. We believe the totality of the study results favored BEMA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine, including a near statistically significant difference between BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine and placebo in the opioid experienced
group of patients in the trial (p=0.067). In addition, when eliminating the group of patients that did not titrate beyond the starting dose, a statistically significant difference between
BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine and placebo (p=0.025) was identified. Neither of these subgroups was sufficiently large enough to be powered to show a statistical difference. Overall, the trial, though
not successful, provided a wealth of knowledge beneficial in the design of two additional Phase 3 clinical studies, which were initiated in the second half of 2012 under our agreement with Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or Endo), as described below.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2012, we announced the signing of a worldwide licensing and development agreement for BEMA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine (which we refer to herein as the Endo Agreement) with Endo under which we granted to Endo the exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize BEMA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain. The financial terms of our agreement with Endo include: (i)&nbsp;a $30 million upfront license fee, which we received in January 2012;
(ii)&nbsp;$95 million in potential milestone payments based on achievement of pre-defined intellectual property, clinical development and regulatory events (some of which we received in 2012); (iii)&nbsp;$55 million in potential sales threshold
payments upon achievement of designated sales levels; and (iv)&nbsp;a tiered, mid- to upper-teen royalty on net sales of BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine in the United States and a mid- to high-single
digit royalty on net sales of BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine outside the United States. Endo is one of the premier companies in the area of pain management and has demonstrated significant achievements
in the pain space, particularly with the development, launch and commercialization of a portfolio of pain therapeutics including Opana<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> ER,
Lidoderm<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and Voltaren<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Gel. We believe BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine is an excellent
fit with Endo&#146;s pain portfolio and will, if approved, add a Schedule III opioid to their branded pain franchise. BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine would complement Endo&#146;s pain therapeutics
portfolio providing the company with an opportunity to offer a &#147;ladder&#148; of pain products, aligned with pain severity and opioid scheduling. In particular, BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine would
potentially be aligned with the needs of pain specialists and primary care physicians who seek an alternative to Schedule II opioids for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain that is not adequately controlled with commonly prescribed
first-line therapies (e.g., NSAIDs). </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">One of the key intellectual property milestones under our Endo Agreement was achieved in February
2012, when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (or USPTO) issued a Notice of Allowance regarding one of our patent applications (No. 13/184306) which, once the patent was granted in April 2012, will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> drug delivery technology for BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine (as well as BUNAVAIL&#153;, as discussed below) from 2020 to 2027. As a result, we
received a milestone payment in the amount of $15 million in May 2012, and also related to the issuance of the patent, will receive an additional milestone payment of $20 million at the time of approval of a New Drug Application (or NDA) by the FDA
for BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain. Such amounts are included in the aforementioned $95 million in potential milestone payments based on intellectual property and
clinical development and regulatory events. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2012, in close collaboration with Endo, we initiated two Phase 3 clinical studies
&#150; one in an opioid na&iuml;ve and one in opioid experienced populations. The Phase 3 clinical trials were enriched-enrollment, double-blind, randomized withdrawal studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BEMA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine in the treatment of chronic lower back pain in opioid naive patients and a population of patients who were opioid experienced. The studies were designed to address some of the
issues encountered in the initial Phase 3 study and included sample size increases, the use of higher doses and multiple adjustments to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients titrated to a well-tolerated, effective dose were randomized to either
continue on that dose of BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine, or receive placebo (BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> film with no active drug), with treatment continuing for 12
weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in the daily average pain numerical rating scale (NRS-Pain) scores from baseline (just prior to randomization) to week twelve of the double-blind treatment period. Pain was self-reported daily
on an 11-point numeric rating scale (daily NRS; 0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interim analyses were conducted as part of the Phase
III protocol in both the opioid na&iuml;ve and opioid experienced studies to allow for adjustments to the sample size in order to maintain appropriate study power to detect statistically significant differences between BEMA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine and placebo. The analyses were conducted by an independent biostatistician. We and Endo announced in September 2013 that, as a result of the interim analyses, no sample size
adjustment would be necessary to the opioid na&iuml;ve study and that additional patients would be added to the ongoing opioid experienced. The outcomes of the interim analyses were significant because they utilized actual study data to confirm or
adjust sample sizes, and importantly, maintain probability of a successful outcome. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;23, 2014, we announced with Endo
positive top-line results from the Phase 3 efficacy study of BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> buprenorphine in opioid-&#147;na&iuml;ve&#148; subjects. The trial successfully met its primary efficacy endpoint in
demonstrating that BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine resulted in significantly (p&lt;0.005) improved chronic pain relief compared to placebo. Additional secondary endpoints were supportive of the efficacy
of BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine compared to placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events in patients treated with buprenorphine compared to placebo were nausea (10% vs. 8%), vomiting (4% vs. 2%)
and constipation (4% vs. 2%). The locking of the database for the opioid na&iuml;ve study triggered a $10 million milestone payment from Endo per the terms of the license agreement, which we received in February 2014. Results from the Phase 3 study
in opioid experienced patients is anticipated in mid-2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>BUNAVAIL&#153; (buprenorphine and naloxone buccal film) </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, we believe that the widespread use of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence presents an additional commercial
opportunity, and we developed a formulation of BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine specifically for the treatment of opioid dependence. The product combines a &#147;high dose&#148; of buprenorphine along with
an abuse deterrent agent, naloxone. BUNAVAIL&#153; provides us with an opportunity to compete in the growing opioid dependence market which, according to Wolters Kluwer, exceeded $1.7 billion in sales in the U.S in 2013. </P>

deliver the high doses of buprenorphine necessary for the treatment of opioid dependence. Following completion of two studies assessing the pharmacokinetics of BUNAVAIL&#153;, a meeting was held with FDA in early February 2012, and following the
meeting, we announced that we had reached an agreement with the FDA on the development plan for BUNAVAIL&#153;, which includes a pivotal pharmacokinetic study comparing BUNAVAIL&#153; to
Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in normal volunteers and a supporting safety study in opioid dependent patients. The FDA concurred with our strategy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2012, we announced the positive outcome of the pivotal pharmacokinetic study comparing BUNAVAIL&#153; to Suboxone<SUP

transmucosal fentanyl products under a single risk management program. The program, which is referred to as the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, was designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before

product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure appropriate use. The approved program covers all marketed transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program which will enhance patient
safety while limiting the potential administrative burden on prescribers and their patients. One common program also ended the disparity in prescribing requirements for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> compared to
similar products and provided ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> with the opportunity for retail and inpatient facility access. Prescribers and patients enrolled in other individual REMS programs will also
automatically be included into the program. In addition to consistency in educational materials, technological advances will simplify the process of participation and verification of program participation. The TIRF REMS program was implemented in
March 2012. It is anticipated that the class-wide REMS puts ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in a better position to compete on its own merits. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;12, 2012, we announced the postponement of the U.S. re-launch of
ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> following the initiation of the class-wide REMS until the product formulation could be modified to address two appearance issues raised by FDA during an inspection of the
manufacturing facility of our North American manufacturing partner for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, Aveva Drug Delivery Systems, Inc. (which we refer to herein as Aveva). Specifically, the FDA identified the
formation of microscopic crystals and a fading of the color in the mucoadhesive layer during the 24-month shelf life of the product.&nbsp;While these changes do not affect the product&#146;s underlying integrity, safety or performance, the FDA
believes that the fading of the color in particular may potentially confuse patients, necessitating a modification of the product and product specification before additional product can be manufactured and distributed.&nbsp;The source of
microcrystal formation and the potential for fading of the product was found to be specific to a buffer used in the manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> has been reformulated and we believe the appearance issues have been resolved. Meda, our commercial partner, is working to determine the content and timing of the submission to FDA. Once
submitted, FDA&#146;s review of the application may take up to 6 months. If the submission is made before mid-2014, and approved by FDA, the relaunch could occur by years end, otherwise, the relaunch would move to sometime 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Clonidine Topical Gel </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
March 2013, we announced our entry into a worldwide licensing agreement with privately held Arcion, where we will develop and commercialize Clonidine Topical Gel (formerly ARC4558) for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy (or PDN) and
potentially other indications. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $2 million to Arcion in the form of unregistered shares of our common stock. Additional financial terms of the licensing agreement include a milestone
payment to Arcion of $2.5 million in unregistered shares of our common stock upon acceptance by the FDA of a NDA for topical clonidine gel and a cash payment to Arcion of between $17.5 and $35 million upon NDA approval, depending on certain
regulatory and commercial considerations. In addition, the licensing agreement includes sales milestones and low single-digit royalties on net worldwide sales. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PDN market is highly under-served by existing products and there is a strong scientific rationale for developing a topical treatment for PDN
that delivers analgesia in a way that avoids systemic side effects. Evidence has shown that clonidine stimulates an inhibitory receptor in the skin associated with pain fibers. Arcion has assessed its effectiveness in reducing pain in PDN in a
double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study where the primary study endpoint was the change in pain intensity over a 3 month treatment period in diabetic foot pain. A significant treatment difference was seen in the planned subset analysis of
diabetic patients who had documented evidence of &#147;functioning pain receptors&#148; in the skin of the lower leg (p=0.01, n=63) thus, at a minimum, supporting the effectiveness of topical clonidine in diabetic patients with functioning pain
receptors of the skin. In the overall population that included patients without &#147;functioning nerve receptors&#148;, there was a trend favoring topical clonidine gel (p=0.07, n= 182), though the overall results did not reach statistical
significance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Oral medications that are approved for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy include anticonvulsants such as Lyrica
(pregabalin), the antidepressant Cymbalta<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (duloxetine) and the opioid Nucynta<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (tapentadol), with sales for the treatment of
neuropathic pain totaling over $3 billion in the U.S. according to Datamonitor. These treatments are modestly effective in relieving symptoms and their use can be limited by adverse effects and drug interactions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We met with representatives of the FDA on November&nbsp;21, 2013 to discuss the development program for Clonidine Topical Gel for the
treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. The FDA agreed with the proposed clinical program which included two placebo-controlled studies and one long term safety study in patients suffering from painful diabetic neuropathy, the number of treated
subjects required for the safety assessment and the plan for data integration of previously performed and planned clinical studies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
discussion provided us with the input and clarity needed to progress the program directly to Phase 3. It also appears that the FDA recognizes the need for new treatment options for painful diabetic neuropathy by confirming Fast Track designation for
the program that could potentially lead to a priority review. </P>

physicians will be able to phone, fax or otherwise electronically deliver the prescription to the pharmacy with refills permitted for up to 6 months, thus making chronic therapy easier for both the patient and the physician. Refills are not
permitted for Schedule II controlled substances, requiring the patient to obtain a new prescription from the doctor&#146;s office and take such prescription to the pharmacy each time the medication is required. </P>

of our North American manufacturing partner for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, Aveva. Specifically, the FDA identified the formation of microscopic crystals and a fading of the color in the mucoadhesive layer
during the 24-month shelf life of the product. While these changes do not affect the product&#146;s underlying integrity, safety or performance, the FDA believes that the fading of the color in particular may potentially confuse patients,
necessitating a modification of the product and product specification before additional product can be manufactured and distributed. The source of microcrystal formation and the potential for fading of the product was found to be specific to a
buffer used in the manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> has been reformulated and we believe the appearance issues have been

STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>) and effervescent buccal tablet (Fentora<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>) formulations of fentanyl. Over the last year, newer products entries, particularly Subsys<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (fentanyl sublingual spray from Insys) have gained significant market share. Additional competitors include Galena Biopharma which licensed from Orexo and subsequently relaunched the sublingual
tablet formulation of fentanyl (Abstral<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>) and DepoMed, which licensed a nasal spray formulation of fentanyl (Lazanda<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>) from Archimedes.
In addition, multiple generic formulations of Actiq<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> are currently available. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The transmucosal fentanyl class has faced significant challenges following safety issues stemming from inappropriate use of Fentora<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and the subsequent &#147;Dear Doctor&#148; letter (Cephalon Press Release, September 2007). Furthermore, the FDA imposed a requirement that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, be
required for all transmucosal fentanyl products. The class-wide REMS requirement includes education, healthcare provider and patient registration, and other elements to assure safe use. The FDA has the authority to remove from the market products
that do not abide by the mandated REMS. In order for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> to be approved and launched, a REMS program needed to be accepted by the FDA and put in place prior to launch. In October 2009,
ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was launched in the U.S. with an accompanying restrictive REMS program. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Despite the requirement that all transmucosal fentanyl products have an approved REMS, the FDA did not reach agreement with Teva on a REMS
program for Fentora<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> or Actiq<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> until July&nbsp;21, 2011, nearly two years after the approval of ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. Teva announced initiation of their REMS program in mid-October 2011. The absence of a REMS program for competing fentanyl products resulted in an un-level competitive environment and a highly
unfavorable selling environment for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FDA eventually abandoned
individual REMS programs through the creation of a consortium consisting of all manufacturers of transmucosal fentanyl products. The goal of the group was to develop one single REMS program covering all products in the class. On December&nbsp;29,
2011, the FDA approved a REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products. The program, which is referred to as the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, was designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions
before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure appropriate use. The approved program covers all marketed transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program which will enhance
patient safety while limiting the potential administrative burden on prescribers and their patients. One common program ended the disparity in prescribing requirements for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> compared to
similar products. In addition to consistency in educational materials, technological advances will simplify the process of participation and verification of program participation. The full program was implemented in March 2012, and the U.S.
re-launch of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is expected to occur under the new class-wide REMS upon availability of product supplies. At that point, it is anticipated that ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> will be in a better position to compete on its own merits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 2013, the overall
market for transmucosal fentanyl products for breakthrough pain according to Wolters Kluwer, totaled $332 million in the U.S. The first approved product for the management of breakthrough cancer pain was Actiq<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate) which, according to Wolters Kluwer, generated $15 million in sales in 2013. Total sales for generic versions of Actiq<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, available from multiple manufacturers including Covidien, Teva and Activis, according to Wolters Kluwer totaled $79 million over the same period. Fentora<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> utilizes an effervescent tablet which is administered buccally. Fentora<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was approved and launched in late 2006 and according to Wolters
Kluwer, generated $126 million in sales in 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2008, ProStrakan announced receipt of marketing authorization from the
German regulatory authorities for their fentanyl sublingual tablet (under the brand name Abstral<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>; licensed from Orexo AB) which was subsequently launched in a number of countries. In January
2010, Abstral<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was approved in the U.S. by the FDA, and Prostrakan launched Abstral<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in the second quarter of 2011. Abstral<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was licensed from Orexo AB. In June 2012, Orexo announced that they would re-acquire the rights to Abstral<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in the U.S. and subsequently
licensed U.S. rights to Galena Biopharma. Galena relaunched Abstral<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in 2013 and cumulative sales totaled $4 million at year end. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the U.S., additional products have been approved by the FDA utilizing other delivery
technologies to administer fentanyl. These products include intranasal Lazanda<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which was approved in June 2011, and a fentanyl sublingual spray formulation from Insys known as Subsys<SUP

fentanyl, and the first product shown to relieve pain within five minutes. The rapid onset of action, coupled with aggressive promotion and a significant co-pay support program, has led to rapid growth. In 2013, Subsys<SUP

delivery system containing sufentanil for the treatment of breakthrough pain. While we have limited information regarding these potential competitors and their development status and strategy, we believe that our technology may be differentiated
because unlike these potential competitors, ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> has a predefined residence time on the buccal membrane providing for consistent drug delivery from dose to dose. We believe that all of the
competitive formulations of fentanyl will have intra-dose variability, meaning the patient may not get the same response each time the product is administered. In addition, it is our belief that the other competitive products may have tolerability
issues and a higher level of potential abuse based on how they are delivered. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The chart below lists products or products in development

breakthrough cancer pain. During that year, Abstral was launched in Canada by Paladin and ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was launched by Meda Valeant. Canada represents a new and potentially important market given
that it is estimated that up to 180,000 people suffer from cancer breakthrough pain. It is anticipated that other formulations of fentanyl will become available in Canada. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In Europe, the total market for transmucosal fentanyl products continues to grow with the availability of new formulations. Multiple
formulations of fentanyl have recently been approved and launched in Europe for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain, including Abstral<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, Effentora<SUP

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A number of products may be competitors to BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine for the treatment of
chronic pain. A potential focus will be to position BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine as a step up from NSAIDs instead of, or prior to, the common practice of prescribing hydrocodone containing combinations
or the more addictive Schedule II narcotics. Indications for such use include pain associated with lower back and severe arthritis conditions. Marketed competitors for these indications include Tramadol (Ultram<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> ER from PriCara and Ryzolt<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> from Purdue), hydrocodone containing combination and extended release (Zohydro<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>) formulations, Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (buprenorphine transdermal patch from Purdue) and the potent opioids such as OxyContin<SUP

STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> from Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Johnson and others. Other competition includes multiple new chemical entities in clinical development with different mechanisms of action as well as various combination
formulations. We also believe that other companies may be exploring the use of buprenorphine in other delivery technologies, though we believe such products lag significantly behind BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
Buprenorphine. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, &#147;abuse deterrent&#148; formulations of pain products are currently being marketed, in clinical
development or under FDA review. These formulations, such as Embeda<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and, Exalgo<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, as well as new formulations of OxyContin<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and Opana<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> ER use a variety of technologies to try and minimize abuse. Abuse deterrent products are likely to play an increasingly
important role in prescribing, potentially even replacing the original product. An advantage of BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine is that the compound, buprenorphine, may be inherently less likely to cause
abuse and addiction given the lower propensity for the product to cause euphoria. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first buprenorphine formulation for the treatment of chronic pain was approved in 2010.
Purdue Pharmaceuticals received FDA approval for Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (buprenorphine transdermal system) in July. Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is indicated for the
management of moderate to severe chronic pain and delivers buprenorphine transdermally (through the skin) over a period of seven days. The approval of Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> signaled the interest and
approvability of new formulations of buprenorphine. It is our view that the flexibility of dosing with a BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> formulation, wider range of doses and ease of use will make it a preferred
formulation for a significant number of patients with chronic pain conditions. Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was launched in early 2011. Sales of Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
in 2013 totaled $141 million and continue to steadily grow. While limited information is available, other formulations of buprenorphine may also be in early stages of development for the treatment of pain. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to direct competitors, there are other factors that impact the market for pain products in general. The significant pricing
pressures and availability of generic products in the U.S. and other regions are likely to have increasing influence on the pharmaceutical market, including pain products. Additionally, opioids continue to garner increased scrutiny based on the
growing problem of prescription drug abuse and addiction. It remains unclear what steps, if any, the FDA or other government agencies may take to address the problem of opioid abuse and addiction. However, in July 2012 the FDA approved a class-wide
REMS program for the extended release and long-acting opioids. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a
medication guide. BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine is anticipated to fall within the existing class-wide REMS program. Also, in late 2013, the FDA recommended the re-classification of hydrocodone
containing combinations from Schedule III to Schedule II. Such a move will make access to hydrocodone more difficult, since Schedule II products require written prescriptions and cannot be prescribed with refills. </P>

are also developing BUNAVAIL&#153;, a higher dose version of buprenorphine combined with naloxone, an abuse deterrent, which has been developed for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. The total market for buprenorphine containing
products for opioid dependence exceeded $1.7 billion in 2013. The products currently marketed for this indication include Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, a sublingual tablet and film formulation of buprenorphine
combined with the abuse deterrent agent naloxone, a sublingual tablet, Zubsolv and generic formulations of both buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone tablets. Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> film achieved sales
of over $1.3 billion in the U.S. in 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In September 2012, Reckitt Benckiser PLC (LSE:RB), the manufacturer of Suboxone<SUP

Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> tablets in the U.S. and subsequently halted further shipments in March 2013. The decision made by Reckitt Benckiser was reportedly due to accumulating data demonstrating
significantly lower rates of accidental pediatric exposure with Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> films compared with their tablet formulation due to the child-resistant, unit-dose packaging of the film versus a
multi-dose bottle for the tablets. Additionally, Reckitt Benckiser issued a Citizens Petition to request that the FDA require all manufacturers of buprenorphine-containing products for the treatment of opioid dependence to implement public health
safeguards including child-resistant, unit-dose packaging to reduce the risk of pediatric exposure. FDA subsequently rejected the Citizens Petition in February 2013, which allowed for the approval of the first generic formulations of Suboxone<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> tablets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The actions taken by Reckitt Benckiser as well as patient preference for a
film formulation of Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> resulted in significant conversion of the Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> market to the branded film formulation. In 2013, the

demonstrated efficacy and safety, and Probuphine was submitted for FDA review in October 2012. Probuphine was anticipated to address the needs of the subset of patients undergoing treatment for opioid dependence who are unable to maintain compliance
with alternative formulations or those who may be at high risk for diversion. In December 2012, Titan announced&nbsp;the signing of a license agreement with Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Sprl. The license grants Braeburn exclusive commercialization
rights in the United States and Canada. In April 2013, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for Probuphine and requested additional data regarding its efficacy. The future status of Probuphine is currently uncertain and the product is not
anticipated to enter the market in the near term. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A sublingual tablet, referred to as

approximately 35 &#150; 40 contract sales representatives and the product is being marketed predominantly based on its claims of improved taste and faster dissolve time compared to Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>.
Sales for Zubsolv<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in 2013 totaled over $3 million in the U.S. At the end of December 2013, Zubsolv<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> had achieved a weekly prescription

create greater awareness and help to further expand what is already a significant and growing market. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Clonidine Topical Gel </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2013, we announced that we had entered into a worldwide licensing agreement with privately held Arcion, where we will develop and
commercialize topical clonidine gel (formerly ARC4558) for the treatment of PDN and potentially other indications. The PDN market is highly under-served by existing products and there is a strong scientific rationale for developing a topical
treatment for PDN that delivers analgesia in a way that avoids systemic side effects. Under the terms of the agreement, we made an upfront payment of $2 million to Arcion in the form of unregistered shares of our common stock. Additional financial
terms of the licensing agreement include a milestone payment to Arcion of $2.5 million in unregistered shares of our common stock upon acceptance by the FDA of a NDA for topical clonidine gel and a cash payment to Arcion of between $17.5 and $35
million upon NDA approval, depending on certain regulatory and commercial considerations. In addition, the licensing agreement includes sales milestones and low single-digit royalties on net worldwide sales. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Evidence has shown that clonidine stimulates an inhibitory receptor in the skin associated with pain fibers. Arcion has developed a patented
topical gel formulation of clonidine and has assessed its effectiveness in reducing pain in PDN in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study where the primary study endpoint was the change in pain intensity over a 3 month treatment period in
diabetic foot pain. A significant treatment difference was seen in the planned subset analysis of diabetic patients who had documented evidence of &#147;functioning pain receptors&#148; in the skin of the lower leg (p=0.01, n=63) thus, at a minimum,
supporting the effectiveness of topical clonidine in diabetic patients with functioning pain receptors of the skin. In the overall population that included patients without &#147;functioning nerve receptors&#148;, there was a trend favoring topical
clonidine gel (p=0.07, n= 182), though the overall results did not reach statistical significance. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Nearly 26&nbsp;million people in the
U.S. have diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association. A substantial number of these people have neuropathy as manifest by impaired sensation and pain in the extremities, most commonly the feet. Patients with PDN often experience
debilitating pain symptoms that affect day-to-day functioning and quality of life. How diabetes causes a length-dependent neuropathy is unknown. In the prior double-blind, randomized, controlled trial approximately 50% of the patients with PDN
demonstrated functional nociceptors in the skin in the painful region as revealed by a response to topical capsaicin. Clonidine is thought to relieve pain by decreasing the abnormal excitability of these functional nociceptors. Currently available
oral treatments are modestly effective in relieving symptoms and are limited by systemic side effects and drug interactions. There are no topical products approved for the treatment of this painful condition. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Oral medications that are approved for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy include anticonvulsants such as Lyrica (pregabalin), the
antidepressant Cymbalta<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (duloxetine) and the opioid Nucynta<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (tapentadol), with sales for the treatment of neuropathic pain totaling
over $3 billion in the U.S. according to Datamonitor. These treatments are modestly effective in relieving symptoms and their use can be limited by adverse effects and drug interactions. </P>

the original claims in MonoSol patents &#145;588, &#145;292 and &#145;891 are invalid or overbroad, and, in connection with inter partes and ex parte reexamination proceedings we have brought before the USPTO, the USPTO has either rejected all

for our product candidates, including BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine and BUNAVAIL&#153; do not infringe MonoSol&#146;s patents, at least because they do not meet the limitations of the claims of
MonolSol&#146;s patents. We maintain our manufacturing processes for our BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> products and product candidates as trade secrets. Based on our examination of these patents, we do not believe
our manufacturing processes infringe MonoSol&#146;s patents. On March&nbsp;7, 2012, the court granted our motion to stay the case pending outcome of the reexamination proceedings in the USPTO. On July&nbsp;3, 2012, the USPTO issued an ex parte
reexamination certificate on the &#145;891 patent, in which all original claims were amended to make them narrower. On August&nbsp;26, 2012, the USPTO issued an ex parte reexamination certificate on the &#145;292 patent, in which all the original
broader claims were replaced with narrower, new claims. On January&nbsp;23, 2013, the USPTO issued a Right of Appeal Notice rejecting all of the claims in the &#145;588 Patent for the third time, and an oral hearing for the appeal, in which both

approval by the FDA in July 2009. Under the Meda agreement, ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> commercial efforts are to be supported by a therapeutic specialty sales force assembled by Meda to target oncologists and
pain management specialists treating cancer breakthrough pain. A specialty sales force consisting of experienced and well trained sales representatives were put in place to promote ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> to
target healthcare providers. These individuals were supported by several internal functions at Meda including marketing, medical affairs and managed care personnel. Sales efforts would be supported through marketing activities, which include journal
advertising in select oncology and pain management medical journals, trade show exhibits, medical education, peer selling programs and electronic and internet promotional activities. During active sales promotion, sales representatives would have

for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> to be approved and launched, a REMS program needed to be accepted by the FDA and put in place prior to launch. Despite this requirement, the FDA did not reach an agreement with

transmucosal fentanyl products. The program, which is referred to as the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, was designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal
fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure appropriate use. The approved program covers all marketed transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program which will enhance patient safety while limiting the potential
administrative burden on prescribers and their patients. One common program also ends the disparity in prescribing requirements for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> compared to similar products. The full program was
implemented in March 2012. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was approved by the Canadian regulatory

affect the product&#146;s underlying integrity, safety or performance, the FDA believes that the fading of the color in particular may potentially confuse patients, necessitating a modification of the product and product specification before
additional product can be manufactured and distributed.&nbsp;Therefore, the U.S. re-launch and additional manufacturing of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> has been postponed until such product appearance issues have

globally. In May 2010, we announced a commercial partnership with Kunwha for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in the Republic of Korea. The agreement results in
potential milestone payments of up to $1.275 million, which included the upfront payment of $0.3 million and royalties based on net sales. In October 2010, a commercial partnership with TTY was announced, providing commercialization rights for
Taiwan. This agreement results in potential milestone payments of up to $1.3 million along with royalties based on sales and included an upfront payment of $0.3 million. </P>

the regulatory approval of BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Fentanyl in Taiwan, where the product will be marketed under the brand name PAINKYL&#153;. The approval in Taiwan resulted in a milestone payment of $0.3

BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine would potentially be aligned with the needs of pain specialists and primary care physicians who seek an alternative to Schedule II opioids for the treatment of moderate to
severe chronic pain that is not adequately controlled with commonly prescribed first-line therapies (e.g. NSAIDs). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>BUNAVAIL<SUP

for the commercialization of BUNAVAIL&#153; in the U.S. The options we explored included commercial partnerships, co-promotion arrangements, leading commercial efforts internally through the use of contract resources, or a combination of the
aforementioned strategic options. Outside, the U.S., we will likely pursue partnerships. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following a thorough assessment of
commercialization options for BUNAVAIL&#153;, we have identified BUNAVAIL&#153; as an attractive product to build a commercial presence capable of supporting both BUNAVAIL&#153; and our other future products. Additionally, the self-commercialization
of BUNAVAIL&#153; supports our longer term vision to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company. The dynamics of the opioid dependence market make self-commercialization both a feasible and attractive option. In total, approximately 90% of all
prescriptions are written by fewer than 5,000 physicians &#150; which include primary care physicians, psychiatrists, addiction medicine specialists and pain specialists, with most concentrated in the eastern third of the U.S. and the west coast,
allowing for virtually full coverage of the prescriber base with a relatively small sales force. Sales force sizing estimates suggest that a field sales force less than 50 could reach the identified target audience with the necessary frequency.
Additionally, the relatively small prescriber base along with the limited number of competitors results in relatively modest marketing expenditures. And finally, the high awareness and physician acceptance of buprenorphine for the treatment of
opioid dependence lessens the need for costly educational and promotional programs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Plans to self-commercialize BUNAVAIL&#153; were
substantially completed in early 2014. We will utilize internal resources to provide the strategic direction and oversight of specialized contractor resources, including a Contract Sales Organization (CSO), that will provide the sales, managed
markets and medical affairs support. Although we presently intend to commercialize BUNVAIL&#153; on our own, we would remain open to the possibility of licensing or partnership arrangements should the arrangement be in the best interest of the

advertising and promotion of our drugs. Drug development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Moreover, ongoing legislation by

sites. Phase 3 frequently involves randomized controlled trials and, whenever possible, studies are conducted in a manner so that neither the patient nor the investigator knows what treatment is being administered. We, or the FDA, may suspend
clinical trials at any time if it is believed that the individuals participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have in the past and will continue to rely upon third party contractors to advise and assist us in the preparation of our INDs and the

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The results of the pharmaceutical and manufacturing development work, nonclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA in the
form of an NDA for approval to market and sell the product. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort. In addition to the results of nonclinical and clinical testing, the NDA applicant must submit detailed
information about chemistry, manufacturing and controls that will describe how the product is made, packaged, labeled, and tested through the manufacturing process. The manufacturing process continues to develop throughout the period of clinical
trials such that at the time of the NDA, it has been demonstrated that there is control of the process and the product can be made consistently at commercial scale. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The NDA review process involves FDA investigation into the details of the manufacturing process, as well as the design and analysis of each of
the nonclinical and clinical studies. This review includes inspection of the manufacturing facility, the data recording process for the clinical studies, the record keeping at a sample of clinical trial sites and a thorough review of the results for
each nonclinical and clinical study. Through this investigation, the FDA reaches a decision about the risk-benefit profile of a product candidate. If the benefit outweighs the risk, the FDA begins negotiation with the company on the content of an
acceptable package insert and an associated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) plan if required. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The NDA review process is affected by a number of factors, including the severity of the disease,
the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Consequently, there is a risk that approval may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if applicable
regulatory criteria are not satisfied. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed, require additional testing or information, or require
post-marketing testing (Phase 4) and surveillance to monitor the safety of a company&#146;s product if it does not believe the NDA contains adequate evidence of its safety. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory
standards is not maintained or health problems are identified that would alter the risk-benefit analysis for the product. Post-approval studies may be conducted to explore the use of the product for new indications or populations such as pediatrics.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Among the conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that any prospective manufacturer&#146;s quality control and manufacturing
procedures conform to Good Manufacturing Practices and the specifications approved in the NDA. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of quality control
and quality assurance to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, also are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other federal, state or local agencies. Additionally, in
the event of non-compliance, the FDA may issue warning letters and/or seek criminal and civil penalties, enjoin manufacture, seize product or revoke approval. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2008, new legislation designated as the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (&#147;FDAAA&#148;) took effect. This
legislation strengthened the FDA&#146;s authority over drug safety and directs the FDA to develop systems aimed at managing the risk-benefit ratio of a drug, with a particular focus on post-approval safety. FDAAA authorized the FDA to require and
enforce a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the potential risks. The legislation also provides the FDA with increased authority to require REMS
at any point in a drug product&#146;s lifecycle based on new safety information. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A REMS is defined by the FDA as a strategy to manage a
known or potential serious risk associated with a drug or biological product. The FDA&#146;s assessment of whether to require a REMS as a condition for approval considers factors such as the size of the population likely to use the drug, the
seriousness of the disease or condition that is to be treated by the drug, the expected benefit, and the seriousness of any known or potential adverse events that may be related to the drug. A REMS may be conveyed through the use of a number of
tools including a Medication Guide for distribution when the drug is dispensed, a communication plan to physicians to convey potential risks, and elements to ensure safe use. These elements may include provisions that healthcare providers who
prescribe the drug and pharmacists who dispense the drug have particular training, experience or special certifications; that the drug be dispensed only in certain healthcare settings; that the drug be dispensed to patients with evidence of safe-use
conditions; and/or that patients must be enrolled in a registry. Under the FDAAA, the FDA has also been granted enforcement authority over violations of the REMS provisions. The FDA may impose civil monetary penalties, the drug or biological product
can be deemed misbranded, and/or the FDA may obtain injunctive relief against further distribution of the product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;29,
2011, the FDA approved a &#147;class-wide&#148; REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products under a single risk management program. ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is subject to this REMS. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering the extended release and long acting opioid class. The class-wide REMS program
consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine is
anticipated to fall within the existing class-wide REMS program. The cost and implementation of the extended release and long-acting opioid REMS is shared among multiple companies in the category. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There also continues to be a REMS in place for buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence. It is expected that BUNAVAIL&#153; will
fall within the existing REMS, which is also far less cumbersome and includes a medication guide and healthcare professional and patient education. Given the existence of a REMS in both the extended release and long-acting opioid and opioid
dependence markets, we anticipate our products will fit within the existing REMS and will avoid the issues encountered with ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, where a REMS program was yet to be developed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>International Approval </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to
the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than
that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general, each country at this time has its own procedures and requirements. </P>

December&nbsp;31, 2013 was approximately $151.3 million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had working capital of approximately $1.6 million, but we do not generate meaningful recurring revenue or cash flow and thus use our working capital to
maintain our operations. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends upon our ability, alone or with others, to complete the development of our product candidates and product concepts, obtain the required regulatory approvals

has been minimal to date due to the fact that ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> has been adversely affected by: (i)&nbsp;the lack of a uniform REMS program at the time of the launch of ONSOLIS<SUP

and anticipated clinical trials and commercial sales. Any such loss would likely increase our expenses and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operation. This is

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The risks associated with reliance on key third parties was demonstrated in 2010 when Aveva experienced certain adverse equipment and
regulatory issues leading to the temporary stoppage of manufacturing of all products at that site, which left us exposed to delays in our and our partners&#146; commercial plans. In addition, in March 2012 Meda temporarily suspended distribution of
ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> following discussions with the FDA regarding issues with the product&#146;s appearance. Specifically, the FDA raised concerns about two cosmetic issues that may have originated from
the formulation used in the manufacturing of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> following an inspection of Aveva, which manufactures ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> on our behalf. On
March&nbsp;12, 2012, we announced the postponement of the U.S. and Canadian re-launch of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> until the product formulation can be modified to address these issues. Therefore, ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is not currently being marketed in the U.S. and Canada and the relaunch and additional manufacturing of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> has been postponed until
such product issues have been resolved. Any future manufacturing interruptions or related supply issues could have a material adverse effect on our company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under our collaborative agreements with Meda, we are responsible for paying certain costs relating to ONSOLIS<SUP

Buprenorphine for pain by conducting certain specified clinical trials in the United States. Our inability to adequately project or control our costs under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our potential profits from such
agreements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We are exposed to product liability, non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial

liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. We expect that such claims are likely to be asserted against us at some point. In addition, the use in our clinical trials of
pharmaceutical formulations and products and the subsequent sale of these formulations or products by us or our potential collaborators may cause us to bear a portion of or all product liability risks. A successful liability claim or series of
claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
currently have a general liability/product liability policy which includes coverage for our clinical trials. Annual aggregate limits include $2 million for general liability, with $1 million for each occurrence; product liability is $5 million for
aggregate and $5 million per occurrence; umbrella&nbsp;liability is $5 million aggregate and $5 million&nbsp;per occurrence. It is possible that this coverage will be insufficient to protect us from future claims. Under our agreements, Meda is
required to carry comprehensive general product liability and tort liability insurance, each in amounts not less than $2 million per incident and US $10 million annual aggregate and to name us as an additional insured thereon. However, we or our
commercial partners may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, and there is a risk that our insurance will not provide adequate coverage against our potential liabilities. Furthermore,
our current and potential partners with whom we have collaborative agreements or our future licensees may not be willing to indemnify us against these types of liabilities and may not themselves be sufficiently insured or have sufficient assets to
satisfy any product liability claims. Claims or losses in excess of any product liability insurance coverage that may be obtained by us or our partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, product liability insurance is costly, and due to the nature of the pharmaceutical products underlying ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and our product candidates, we or our partners may not be able to obtain such insurance, or, if obtained, we or our partners may not be able to maintain such insurance on economically feasible
terms. If a product or product candidate related action is brought against us, or liability is found against us prior to our obtaining product liability insurance for any product or product candidate, or should we have liability found against us for
any other matter in excess of any insurance coverage we may carry, we could face significant difficulty continuing operations. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We
are presently a party to a lawsuit by a third party who claims that our products, methods of manufacture or methods of use infringe on their intellectual property rights, and we may be exposed to these types of claims in the future. </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are presently and may continue to be exposed to litigation by third parties based on claims that our technologies, processes, formulations,

technologies. Without these licenses, the use of technologies would be limited and the sales of our products could be prohibited. Therefore, any disruption in access to the technologies could substantially delay the development and sale of our

frequently uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, our patents, patent applications and licensed
rights may not provide protection against competitive technologies or may be held invalid if challenged or could be circumvented. Our competitors may also independently develop drug delivery technologies or products similar to ours or design around
or otherwise circumvent patents issued to, or licensed by, us. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. law. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
We require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment-of-inventions agreements with us. These agreements provide that materials and confidential information developed or made known to
the individual during the course of the individual&#146;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances and assign the ownership of relevant inventions created during the course
of employment to us. These agreements may be breached, and in some instances, we may not have an appropriate remedy available for breach of the agreements. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary

acts of God or any other factor would have a material adverse effect on our company. Such risks were demonstrated when certain manufacturing issues were experienced at Aveva in 2010-2011 and when, subsequently and separately, the FDA identified
certain product appearance issues with ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which resulted in the March 2012 postponement of the U.S. and Canadian relaunch of the product until such issues are resolved. We do not carry

Therefore, we are dependent on third parties for our formulation development, manufacturing and the packaging of our products. This is particularly true with respect to Aveva, the primary manufacturer of our only approved product, ONSOLIS<SUP

such as Meda, with inadequate supplies of product to sell, especially when regulatory requirements or customer demand necessitate the need for additional product supplies. Our inability to adequately establish, supervise and conduct (either
ourselves or through third parties) all aspects of the formulation and manufacturing processes, and the inability of third party manufacturers like Aveva to consistently supply quality product when required would have a material adverse effect on
our ability to commercialize and sell our products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">These risks associated with reliance on key third party manufacturers was
demonstrated in 2010 when Aveva experienced certain adverse equipment and regulatory issues leading to the temporary stoppage of manufacturing of all products at that site, which impacted our and our partners&#146; commercial plans. Additionally, in
March 2012, Meda temporarily suspended distribution of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> following discussions with the FDA regarding certain appearance issues with the product. Specifically, the FDA raised concerns

ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is formulated with the potent narcotic fentanyl. On December&nbsp;29, 2011, FDA approved a REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products. The program, which is referred to
as the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, was designed to ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure
appropriate use. The approved program covers all approved transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program and was implemented in March 2012. There is a risk that healthcare providers may respond negatively to this class-wide REMS program in a
manner similar to the original ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> REMS program that we were required to implement prior to the adoption of the class-wide REMS. Should this occur, Meda&#146;s ability to generate revenue
from sales of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in the U.S. and Canada, once the appearance and related formulation issues have been resolved and the product is relaunched in the U.S. and Canada, could be materially
compromised, which would result in low royalty payments to us. Additionally, the FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering the extended release and long acting opioid class. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational
program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine is anticipated to fall within the existing
class-wide REMS program. The cost and implementation of the extended release and long-acting opioid REMS is shared among multiple companies in the category. </P>

(Buprenorphine-containing Transmucosal products for Opioid Dependence) REMS. BUNAVAIL&#153; will fall within the existing REMS, which is far less cumbersome and includes a medication guide and healthcare professional and patient education. Given the
existence of a REMS in both the extended release and long-acting opioid and opioid dependence markets, we anticipate our products will fit within the existing REMS and will avoid the issues encountered with ONSOLIS<SUP

and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or

our stated intention to seek to avail ourselves of the FDA&#146;s 505(b)(2) approval procedure where it is appropriate to do so. Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act permits an applicant to file a NDA where at least
some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and the FDA&#146;s findings of
safety and effectiveness based on certain preclinical testing or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. If
this approval pathway is not available to us with respect to a particular formulation or product, or at all, the time and cost associated with developing and commercializing such formulations or products may be prohibitive and our business strategy
would be materially and adversely affected. For example, in September 2012, the FDA received a Citizen Petition requesting that it refuse to file any Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) NDA or abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, for buprenorphine/naloxone
drugs intended to be applied to the oral mucosal membranes unless such application refers to the sublingual film formulation of Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, rather than the tablet formulation, as the reference
listed drug, or RLD. Our proposed Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) marketing application for BUNAVAIL&#153; is expected to reference the tablet formulation of Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> rather than the film formulation
as the reference listed drug, and the data we have generated has been based off of the tablet formulation of Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. While the FDA, on February&nbsp;22, 2013, rejected the Citizen Petition
referred to above, we may be faced with similar issues in the future which might require us to conduct additional studies of our product candidates or otherwise face delays and additional costs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, we may be required to conduct additional costly and time-consuming clinical studies beyond those that we originally anticipate in
the event that our clinical trials fail to meet their primary endpoints or for other reasons, which would render them inadequate to support approval by the FDA. For example, in September 2011, we announced that our Phase 3 clinical trial for BEMA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine did not meet its primary endpoint and therefore we were required to conduct new trials. In our licensing and development agreement with Endo, we are responsible for the conduct of
planned clinical studies leading up to the submission of an NDA for BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine. Conducting a new clinical trial in accordance with the FDA requirements has required significant
additional capital, and we will not be able to commercialize and sell our BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine product until we are able to meet our primary endpoints for both trials and obtain subsequent FDA
approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent

do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later non-clinical studies and clinical trials. Moreover, non-clinical and clinical data are susceptible to multiple and varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent
regulatory approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those involved in competing drug delivery technologies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier
trials. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a proposed formulation or product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the product candidate, resulting in delays to commercialization, and
could materially harm our business. In additional, our clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our drugs, and thus our proposed drugs may not be approved
for marketing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, if any of our clinical trials do not meet their primary endpoints, or for a variety of other reasons, we may be
required to conduct additional clinical trials in order to progress development of the subject product. These additional trials would be costly and time-consuming, and would divert resources from other projects. The foregoing risks were evidenced by
the failure of our Phase 3 trial for BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain to meet its primary endpoint, which we announced September 2011. </P>

insufficient to protect us from future claims. Should we decide to seek additional insurance against such risks before our product sales commence, there is a risk that such insurance will be unavailable to us, or if it can be obtained at such time,
that it will be available at an unaffordable cost. Even if we obtain insurance, it may prove inadequate to cover claims and/or litigation costs, especially in the case of wrongful death claims. Product liability claims or other claims related to our

The loss of the services of these or other key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays to product development or approval, loss of sales and diversion of management resources. In
addition, we depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel, including research scientists. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often
lengthy. We may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis, if at all, which would negatively impact our development and commercialization programs. </P>

the Financial Accounting Standards Board (including its Emerging Issues Task Force). In 2012, we became engaged in an SEC review process over our accounting (under applicable revenue recognition literature) for payments we received under our license
and commercialization with Endo. On February&nbsp;28, 2013, we announced the conclusion of that review, which led to our adoption of an alternative revenue recognition interpretation and a resulting restatement of our unaudited financial statements
for the first three fiscal quarters of 2012. We may be faced with similar issues in the future, and adjustments to or restatements of our financial statements or accounting policies could have a material adverse effect on our public stock price and

there is a risk that an active trading market in our securities may not be adequately maintained. In addition, the overall market for securities in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected
the market prices of many smaller companies. In particular, the market prices of securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have been extremely volatile, and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or
disproportionate to operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our securities, which could cause a decline in the value of your securities. These fluctuations, as
well as general economic and market conditions, may have a material or adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>If

meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market and NASDAQ rules, which require, among other things, maintaining a minimum bid price per share of $1.00, minimum stockholders equity of $2.5 million or a minimum market
capitalization of $35 million and a majority of &#147;independent&#148; directors on our board of directors. We have been subject to delisting proceedings and comments by NASDAQ in the past, and during 2011 our stock price declined to levels that
put us at risk of not being able to maintain the required minimum bid price or market capitalization levels or both. If we are unable to satisfy the NASDAQ criteria for continued listing, especially at our current stock price levels, our securities
could again be subject to delisting. Trading, if any, of our securities would thereafter be conducted in the over-the-counter market, in the so-called &#147;pink sheets&#148; or on the OTC Bulletin Board. As a consequence of any such delisting, our
stockholders would likely find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the prices of our securities. </P>

2011, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $.001, of our common stock from 45,000,000 to 75,000,000 shares. This increase in our authorized
shares of common stock provides us with the flexibility to issue more shares in the future, which might cause dilution to our stockholders. In addition, the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include shares
reserved in anticipation of the exercise of outstanding options or warrants. To the extent such options (including options under our stock incentive plan) or warrants are exercised, the holders of our common stock may experience further dilution.

and upon the exercise of options and warrants, investors would experience additional dilution. Finally, in addition to the above referenced shares of common stock which may be issued without stockholder approval, we have 5&nbsp;million shares of
authorized preferred stock, of which 2,709,300 shares have been designated as Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock. The remaining 2,290,700 shares of preferred stock remain undesignated shares of preferred stock, the terms of which may be
fixed by our board of directors. We have issued preferred stock in the past, and our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to create and issue one or more additional series of such preferred stock and to determine the
voting, dividend and other rights of holders of such preferred stock. The issuance of any of such series of preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the holders of common stock. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;2, 2010, MonoSol filed an action against us and our commercial partners for ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in the Federal District Court of New Jersey (&#147;DNJ&#148;) for alleged patent infringement and false marking. We were formally served in this matter on January&nbsp;19, 2011. MonoSol claims
that our manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which has never been disclosed publicly and which we and our partners maintain as a trade secret, infringes its patent (United States Patent
No.&nbsp;7,824,588) (the &#147; &#145;588 Patent&#148;). Of note, the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology itself is not at issue in the case, nor is BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
Buprenorphine or BUNAVAIL&#153;, but rather only the manner in which ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which incorporates the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology, is
manufactured. Pursuant to its complaint, MonoSol is seeking an unspecified amount of damages, attorney&#146;s fees and an injunction preventing future infringement of MonoSol&#146;s patents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We strongly refute as without merit MonoSol&#146;s assertion of patent infringement, which relates to our confidential, proprietary
manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. On February&nbsp;23, 2011, we filed our initial answer in this case. In our answer, we stated our position that our products, methods and/or components do
not infringe MonoSol&#146;s &#145;588 Patent because they do not meet the limitations of any valid claim of such patent. Moreover, in our answer, we stated our position that MonoSol&#146;s &#145;588 Patent is actually invalid and unenforceable for
failure to comply with one or more of the requirements of applicable U.S. patent law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;12, 2011, we filed a request for
inter partes reexamination in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#147;USPTO&#148;) of MonoSol&#146;s &#145;588 Patent demonstrating that all claims of such patent were anticipated by or obvious in the light of prior art references,
including several prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and thus invalid. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, we filed in court a motion for stay pending the outcome of the reexamination proceedings, which subsequently was granted due
to the results of the USPTO proceedings as described below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;28, 2011, we announced that we were informed by the USPTO
that it had rejected all 191 claims of MonoSol&#146;s &#145;588 Patent. On January&nbsp;20, 2012, we filed requests for reexamination before the USPTO of MonoSol&#146;s US patent No 7,357,891 (the </P>

&#147;&#145;891 Patent&#148;), and No 7,425,292 (the &#147;&#145;292 Patent&#148;), the two additional patents asserted by MonoSol, demonstrating that all claims of those two patents were
anticipated by or obvious in the light of prior art references, including prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and thus invalid. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February and March 2012, respectively, the USPTO granted the requests for reexamination we filed with respect to MonoSol&#146;s &#145;292
and &#145;891 Patents. In its initial office action in each, the USPTO rejected every claim in each patent. Based on the action of the USPTO on these three patent reexaminations, the court in our case with MonoSol conducted a status conference on
March&nbsp;7, 2012, at which it granted our motion to stay the case pending final outcome of the reexamination proceedings in the USPTO. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As expected, in the &#145;891 Patent and &#145;292 Patent Ex Parte Reexamination proceedings, MonoSol amended the claims several times and
made multiple declarations and arguments in an attempt to overcome the rejections made by the USPTO. These amendments, declarations and other statements regarding the claim language significantly narrowed the scope of their claims in these two
patents. In the case of the &#145;891 Patent, not one of the original claims survived reexamination and five separate amendments were filed confirming our position that the patent was invalid. Additionally, we believe that arguments and admissions
made by MonoSol prevent it from seeking a broader construction during any subsequent litigation by employing arguments or taking positions that contradict those made during prosecution. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A Reexamination Certificate for MonoSol&#146;s &#145;891 Patent in its amended form was issued August&nbsp;21, 2012 (Reexamined Patent
No.&nbsp;7,357,891C1 or the &#145;891C1 Patent). A Reexamination Certificate for MonoSol&#146;s &#145;292 Patent in its amended form was issued on July&nbsp;3, 2012 (Reexamined Patent No.&nbsp;7,425,292C1 or the &#145;292C1 Patent). These actions by
the USPTO confirm the invalidity of the original patents and through the narrowing of the claims in the reissued patents strengthens our original assertion that our products and technologies do not infringe on MonoSol&#146;s original patents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Inter partes reviews, a new USPTO process to review the patentability of one or more claims of patents, was enacted in September, 2012. As
such, on June&nbsp;12, 2013, despite our previously noted success in the prior ex parte reexaminations for the &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents, we availed ourselves of this new process and filed requests for inter partes reviews on the narrowed yet
reexamined patents, the &#145;292C1 and &#145;891C1 Patents, to challenge their validity and continue to strengthen our position. This inter partes review process allows us to actively participate in the reviews and address any of MonoSol&#146;s
arguments and representations made during the review process, which heightens our ability to invalidate these patents. On November&nbsp;13, 2013, the USPTO decided not to institute the two inter partes reviews for the &#145;891C1 and &#145;292C1
Patents. The USPTO&#146;s decision was purely on statutory grounds and based on a technicality (in that the IPRs were not filed within what the UPSTO determined to be the statutory period) rather than substantive grounds. Thus, even though the inter
partes reviews were not instituted, the USPTO decision preserves our right to raise the same arguments at a later time (e.g., during litigation). Regardless, our assertion that our products and technologies do not infringe the original &#145;292 and
&#145;891 Patents and, now, the reexamined &#145;891C1 and &#145;292C1 Patents remains the same. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Importantly, in the case of
MonoSol&#146;s &#145;588 Patent, the USPTO on July&nbsp;20, 2012 issued a second Office Action closing prosecution and rejecting for a second time all claims as anticipated or obvious. It also rejected the amended claims proposed by MonoSol as
unclear and lacking support. Then, on January&nbsp;23, 2013, the USPTO issued a Right of Appeal Notice, rejecting all claims of the &#145;588 Patent and closing reexamination proceedings. This action confirms that all claims of this patent are also
invalid, but unlike &#145;292 and &#145;891, the USPTO has not found that any amended or narrower claims should be granted. On February&nbsp;22, 2013, MonoSol filed both a Notice of Appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences and a
Request for Continuing Examination of the &#145;588 Patent.&nbsp;On March&nbsp;12, 2013, we filed a petition requesting the USPTO to deny MonoSol&#146;s February&nbsp;22, 2013 Request to Continue Examination and to allow the proceedings to go to an
appeal. Subsequently, on July&nbsp;3, 2013, the USPTO denied MonoSol&#146;s February&nbsp;22, 2013 Request to Continue Examination. After reviewing MonoSol&#146;s Appeal Brief (filed June&nbsp;24, 2013) and our Respondent&#146;s Brief (filed
July&nbsp;24, 2013), the USPTO formally initiated the appeals process with the Examiner&#146;s Answer on August&nbsp;8, 2013, which affirmed the rejection of all the claims in the &#145;588 Patent. An oral hearing for the appeal, in which both
parties will have an opportunity to make arguments before the Patent Trial&nbsp;&amp; Appeal Board (&#147;PTAB&#148;) has been scheduled for March&nbsp;26, 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on our original assertion that our proprietary manufacturing process for
ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> does not infringe on patents held by MonoSol, and the denial and subsequent narrowing of the claims on the two reissued patents MonoSol has asserted against us while the third has had
all claims rejected by the USPTO, we remain very confident in our original stated position regarding this matter. Thus far, we have proven that the &#147;original&#148; &#145;292 and &#145;891 patents in light of their reissuance with fewer and
narrower claims were indeed invalid and the third and final patent, &#145;588, has had all claims rejected and appears to have had a similar fate. Importantly, we will continue to defend this case vigorously, and we anticipate that MonoSol&#146;s
claims against us will ultimately be rejected. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&nbsp;29, 2013, Reckitt Benckiser, Inc., RB Pharmaceuticals Limited, and MonoSol (collectively, the &#147;RB Plaintiffs&#148;) filed
an action against us relating to our BUNAVAIL&#153; product in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina for alleged patent infringement. BUNAVAIL&#153; is a proposed treatment for opioid dependence. The RB
Plaintiffs claim that the formulation for BUNAVAIL&#153;, which has never been disclosed publicly, infringes its patent (United States Patent No.&nbsp;8,475,832) (the &#147;&#145;832 Patent&#148;). We believe this is another anticompetitive attempt
by the RB Plaintiffs to distract our efforts from commercializing BUNAVAIL&#153;. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that this action is in response to a 2013
decision wherein the FDA recently ruled in favor of our position in two Citizen Petitions filed by the RB Plaintiffs that sought to prevent the FDA from accepting and filing our NDA for BUNAVAIL&#153;. The two Citizen Petitions, filed on
December&nbsp;2, 2011 and August&nbsp;13, 2013, respectively, included requests that the FDA refuse to accept for filing any NDAs submitted using the 505 (b)(2) regulatory pathway for buprenorphine/naloxone products consisting of a polymer film for
application to the buccal mucosal membranes (such as BUNAVAIL&#153;), unless such application references the NDA for Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual film (and not the Suboxone<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> sublingual tablet NDA). Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is an approved product for opioid dependence. The requirement to reference the Suboxone<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> film formulation, which is under patent exclusivity with Orange Book-listed patents, including the &#145;832 Patent, was aimed at delaying the eventual approval of BUNAVAIL&#153;. FDA did not
agree with these arguments and in its decision on September&nbsp;18, 2013, it denied the requests and subsequently, accepted and filed the BUNAVAIL&#153; NDA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the RB Plaintiff&#146;s claim of patent infringement has no more validity than the recently rejected Citizen Petitions, but is
being used as another anticompetitive attempt to distract us in our efforts toward commercializing BUNAVAIL&#153;. We look forward to the FDA&#146;s review of the BUNAVAIL&#153; NDA as it moves toward the June&nbsp;7, 2014 PDUFA date when we expect
a response from FDA on our NDA for BUNAVAIL&#153;. In the meantime, we strongly refute as without merit the RB Plaintiffs&#146; assertion of patent infringement and will vigorously defend the lawsuit. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;13, 2013, we filed a motion to dismiss RB Plaintiff&#146;s suit based on insufficient pleadings and lack of standing. In
response, RB Plaintiffs filed its opposition to our motion to dismiss on January&nbsp;22, 2014. We filed our reply to RB&#146;s opposition to our motion to dismiss on February&nbsp;10, 2014. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;15, 2014, we filed a request for inter partes review in the USPTO of the &#145;832 Patent demonstrating that certain claims of

consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The actual results may differ materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those which are not within our control. </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Background of Our Company </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are
a specialty pharmaceutical company that is developing and commercializing, either on our own or in partnerships with third parties, new applications of proven therapeutics to address important unmet medical needs using both proven and new drug
delivery technologies. From the founding of our predecessor in 1995 through 2002, we were a development stage company and exited the development stage upon our execution of a license agreement relating to a prior delivery technology which we are no
longer developing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2004 we acquired Arius Pharmaceuticals, the then licensee (and now owner) of our BEMA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> drug delivery technology, and July 2006, we licensed commercialization rights in Europe for our lead product, the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> based ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, to Meda. In September 2007, we entered into a definitive License and Development Agreement with Meda for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in the U.S., Canada and
Mexico. In January 2012, we entered into a definitive License and Development Agreement with Endo for BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine for chronic pain and are working with Endo to complete U.S.
development of the product for purposes of seeking FDA approval. In March&nbsp;2013, we entered into a definitive Exclusive License Agreement with Arcion pursuant to which Arcion agreed to grant to us an exclusive commercial world-wide license, with
rights of sublicense, under certain patent and other intellectual property rights related to in-process research and development to develop, manufacture, market, and sell gel products containing clonidine (or a derivative thereof), alone or in
combination with other active ingredients, for topical administration for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and other indications. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We expect to continue research and development of pharmaceutical products and related drug delivery technologies, some of which will be funded
by our commercialization agreements. We will continue to seek additional license agreements, which may include up-front payments. We may also seek to commercialize products such as BUNAVAIL&#153; on our own or in conjunction with third parties. We
anticipate that funding for the next several years will come primarily from milestone payments and royalties from Meda and Endo, potential revenues from sales of BUNAVAIL&#153;, potential sale of securities, collaborative research agreements,
including those with pharmaceutical companies and potential exercises of our warrants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have a very limited history of commercial
operations, having focused the vast majority of our corporate effort on research and development activities. We have, since our founding, received revenue in the form of: (i)&nbsp;contract revenue from Endo related to an upfront, non-refundable
payment for a license of our BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine product in 2012(a portion of which was recorded as deferred revenue that is being recognized as revenue under prevailing revenue recognition
rules), (ii)&nbsp;payment from Endo for a certain patent-related milestone (iii)&nbsp;royalty revenue from Meda from sales of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>; (iv)&nbsp;up-front non-refundable license and milestone
payments from Meda in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012 (which were initially classified as deferred revenue and subsequently, a substantial amount was reclassified as recognized revenue under prevailing revenue recognition rules), (v)&nbsp;revenue from the
sale of a royalty stream in 2004, (vi)&nbsp;research and collaboration revenues, including research revenues in 2010 and 2013 from TTY and Kunwha and (vii)&nbsp;minimal royalty revenue from a license with Accentia. Most of these types of revenue are
generally not repeating or predictable. Therefore, we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate significantly for the foreseeable future, particularly until we generate recurring revenue from product sales, with the foremost
opportunity being potential revenue from sales of BUNAVAIL&#153;, should that product receive FDA approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Readers are cautioned that
period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties normally encountered by companies that are
involved in the development and commercialization of their products and related technologies, particularly companies in new and rapidly changing markets such as pharmaceuticals, drug delivery and biotechnology. For the foreseeable future, we must,
among other things, invest in non-clinical and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for and commercialization of, our product candidates, the outcomes of which are subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond our control. We must
also maintain our relationships with our key commercial partners and address regulatory, legal and/or commercial issues and risks that relate to our business from time to time, many of which could impact, perhaps negatively, our planned operations.
We may not be able to appropriately address these risks and difficulties. </P>

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (referred to herein as GAAP), goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level annually, or more frequently if indicated by events or conditions. We performed an evaluation and determined
that there is only one reporting unit. In the course of the evaluation of the potential impairment of Goodwill, either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment may be performed. If a qualitative evaluation determines that no impairment exists,
then no further analysis is performed. If a qualitative evaluation is unable to determine whether impairment has occurred, a quantitative evaluation is performed. The quantitative impairment test first identifies potential impairments by comparing
the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated and an impairment
is recorded if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount. The determination of goodwill impairment is highly subjective. It considers many factors both internal and external and is subject to significant changes from period to period.
No goodwill impairment charges have resulted from this analysis for 2013, 2012 or 2011. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An impairment of a long-lived asset other than
goodwill is recognized under GAAP if the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets of which it is a part) exceeds (i)&nbsp;the future estimated undiscounted cash flow from the use of the asset (or group of assets) and (ii)&nbsp;the fair
value of the asset (or asset group). In making this impairment assessment, we predominately use an undiscounted cash flow model derived from internal forecasts. Factors that could change the result of our impairment test include, but are not limited
to, different assumptions used to forecast future net sales, expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements used in our cash flow models. In the event that our management determines that the value of intangible assets have become
impaired using this approach, we will record an accounting charge for the amount of the impairment. No impairment charges have been recorded for other amortizing intangibles in 2013, 2012 or 2011. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The most significant estimate that could have a material effect on net (loss) gain is the fair market value accounting for our derivative
liability.&nbsp;Our derivative liability consists of free standing warrants that are recorded as liabilities due to the registration rights agreements and the requirement for continued effectiveness of the warrants.&nbsp;As a result, the warrants
must be recorded as a liability at fair value.&nbsp;The changes in fair value are posted to the derivative gain (loss) in other (loss) income.&nbsp;We utilize the Black Scholes method to estimate the fair value of our warrants.&nbsp;The three most
significant factors in the Black Scholes calculation are (i)&nbsp;our stock price, (ii)&nbsp;the volatility of our stock price and (iii)&nbsp;the remaining term of the warrants.&nbsp;During the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2012, a $3.50 increase in
the value of our stock was the primary cause of the $5.6 million derivative loss. During the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had a lower average remaining term of the warrants, and the Black Scholes volatility of our stock over this remaining
term was relatively low compared to 2012.&nbsp;These two factors lowered the Black Scholes value of the warrants, even though our stock price increased in 2013 of $1.58.&nbsp;The result was a $0.1 million derivative gain. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification
(&#147;FASB&#148;)(&#147;ASC&#148;) FASB ASC Topic 718 &#151; Accounting for Share-Based Payments<I>,</I> which provides for the use of the fair value based method to determine compensation for all arrangements where shares of stock or equity
instruments are issued for compensation. Fair values of equity securities issued are determined by management based predominantly on the trading price of our common stock. The values of these awards are based upon their grant-date fair value. That
cost is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We use the
Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option and warrant grants. In applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model during 2013, we assumed no dividend yield, risk-free interest rates ranging from 0.70% to 1.60%,
expected option terms ranging from 5 to 6 years (for employee options), a volatility factor ranging from 77.59% to 81.65% and option exercise prices ranging from $4.33 to $5.39. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also use the Black Scholes option pricing model as the primary basis for valuing our derivative liabilities at each reporting date (both
embedded and free-standing derivatives). The underlying assumptions used in this determination are primarily the same as are used in the determination of stock-based compensation discussed in the previous paragraph except contractual lives of the
derivative instruments are utilized rather than expected option terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Revenue Recognition </I></P>

each arrangement are to be considered one combined unit of accounting since the fair value of the undelivered license was not determinable and the research and development efforts provided do not have stand-alone value apart from the license. As
such, all cash payments from Meda related to these deliverables prior to FDA approval in July 2009 were recorded as deferred revenue. All cash payments from Meda for upfront and milestone payments and research and development services provided are
nonrefundable. Upon commencement of the license term (date of first commercial sale in each territory), the license and certain research and development services deliverables were deliverable to Meda. The first commercial sale in the U.S. occurred
in October 2009. As a result, $59.7 million of the aggregate milestones and services revenue was recognized as revenue. The first commercial sale in a European country occurred in October 2012.&nbsp;As a result, $17.5 million was recognized as
revenue, which included $5.0 million in milestones received during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012.&nbsp;At&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2013, there was remaining deferred revenue of $1.3 million which is related to the Meda research and development

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon delivery of the license to Meda, we have determined that each of the undelivered obligations have stand-alone value to Meda as these
post-commercialization services encompass additional clinical trials on different patient groups but do not require further product development and these services and product supply obligations can be provided by third-party providers available to
Meda. We have also obtained third-party evidence of fair value for the other research and development services and other service obligations, based on hourly rates billed by unrelated third-party providers for similar services contracted by us. We
have obtained third-party evidence of fair value of the product supply deliverable based on the outsourced contract manufacturing cost charged to us from the third-party supplier of the product. The arrangements do not contain any general rights of
return. Therefore, the remaining deliverables to the arrangements will be accounted for as three separate units of accounting to include (1)&nbsp;product supply, (2)&nbsp;research and development services for the ONSOLIS<SUP

are provided through expiration of the license terms, as defined above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have determined that we are acting as a principal under the

at inception to determine: (i)&nbsp;the separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, (ii)&nbsp;which payments should be allocated to which of those units of accounting and (iii)&nbsp;the appropriate revenue recognition pattern or
trigger for each of those payments. The assessment requires subjective analysis and requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about whether deliverables within multiple-element arrangements are separable and, if so, to
determine the amount of arrangement consideration to be allocated to each unit of accounting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the inception of the Endo arrangement
and in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria, we determined that: the Endo Agreement is a multi-deliverable arrangement with three deliverables: (1)&nbsp;the license rights related to
BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine, (2)&nbsp;services related to obtaining enhanced intellectual property rights through the issuances of a particular patent, and (3)&nbsp;clinical development services. We
concluded that the license delivered to Endo at the inception of the Endo Agreement has stand-alone value because Endo obtained, at the inception of the Endo Agreement, all of the rights and knowledge necessary to fully exploit its license without
our further involvement. It was also determined that there was a fourth deliverable, the provision of clinical trial material (&#147;CTM&#148;). The amounts involved are, however, immaterial and delivered in essentially the same time frame as the
clinical development services. Accordingly, we have not separately accounted for the CTM deliverable, but consider it part of the clinical development services deliverable. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The initial non-refundable $30 million license fee was required to be allocated to each of the three deliverables based upon their relative
selling prices using best estimates. The analysis of the best estimate of the selling price of the deliverables was based on the income approach, our negotiations with Endo and other factors, and was further based on management&#146;s estimates and
assumptions which included consideration of how a market participant would use the license, estimated market opportunity and market share, our estimates of what contract research organizations would charge for clinical development services, the
costs of clinical trial materials and other factors. Also considered were entity specific assumptions regarding the results of clinical trials, the likelihood of FDA approval of the subject product and the likelihood of commercialization based in
part on our prior agreements with the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on this analysis,
$15.6 million of the up-front license fee was allocated to the license (which was estimated to have a value significantly in excess of $30 million), and $14.4 million to&nbsp;clinical development services (which is inclusive of the cost of
CTM).&nbsp;Although the intellectual property component was considered a separate deliverable, no distinct amount of the up-front payment was assigned to this deliverable because we determined the deliverable to be perfunctory. In April 2012, the
patent being sought by us was granted as described further below, and in May 2012, the applicable intellectual property milestone payment of $15 million was received and recognized as revenue. The amount allocated to the license was recognized as
revenue in January 2012. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The portion of the upfront license fee allocated to the clinical development services deliverable ($14.4
million) is being recognized as those services are performed.&nbsp;We estimate that such performance will extend into the first half of 2015.&nbsp;Based on the estimated proportion of those services performed in 2013, $5.2 million of that amount was
recognized in 2012 and $6.3 million was recognized in 2013. As a result, $2.9 million remains deferred at December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
analyzed the milestone payments noted above to determine if such milestones are substantive. This determination included an analysis of our performance to achieve each milestone, the enhancement of value of the delivered items, the timing of
performance related to the milestone, and the reasonability of the milestone relative to all the deliverables and payment terms. We concluded that each of the milestones are substantive. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of the Endo Agreement shall last, on a country-by-country basis, until the later of: (i)&nbsp;10 years from the date of the first

million and $1.1 million in product royalty revenue during the years ended 2013 and 2012, respectively, under our license agreement with Meda. The increase in product royalty revenues can be attributed to the commercial launch of BREAKYL&#153; in
the EU in October 2012. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Research Revenues</I>. We recognized $0.01 million of revenue related to a research and development agreement

recognized $6.3 million and $35.8 million in contract revenue during the years ended 2013 and 2012, respectively, under our license agreement with Endo. We recognized $0.06 million and $17.5 million in previously deferred revenue from Meda as a
result of the E.U. launch and $0.2 million and $0.1 million as a result of ongoing development service obligations related to the Meda agreement in 2013 and 2012, respectively. We recognized $0.3 million in contract revenue during the year ended
2013 related to our license agreement with TTY. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Research and Development Reimbursements</I>. We recognized $2.8 million of

$53.3 million and $35.4 million, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses can be attributed to two pivotal pain studies and one safety trial pursuant to the Endo Agreement for our Buprenorphine chronic pain program.&nbsp;The
safety trial did not begin until October 2012. In addition, the two pivotal pain studies in 2013 had more patients and corresponding recruiting activities than were experienced in the corresponding prior year period. Our scientific staff continues
to work toward development and application of our BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> delivery technology, which includes ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, BEMA<SUP

measured using Black-Scholes calculations.&nbsp;A major component of the calculation is our stock price.&nbsp;During the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2013, we had a lower average remaining term of the warrants, and the Black Scholes volatility of
our stock over this remaining term was relatively low compared to 2012.&nbsp;These two factors lowered the Black Scholes value of the warrants, even though our stock price increased in 2013 by $1.58.&nbsp;The result was a $0.1 million derivative

property-related milestone. In November 2012, we closed a registered direct offering of our common stock and newly designated Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share. The final amount of securities issued in the
offering was an aggregate of (i)&nbsp;6,791,887 shares of Common Stock and (ii)&nbsp;2,709,300 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The net proceeds to us, after deducting placement agent fees, the corporate finance fee and estimated offering
expenses, was approximately $38.4 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In July 2013, we entered into a $20 million secured loan facility pursuant to a Credit and

November 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement which registered up to $75 million of our securities for potential future issuance, and such registration statement was declared effective on December 18, 2013. Concurrently with the filing of
such registration statement, we established an &#147;at-the-market&#148; offering program utilizing the universal shelf registration for up to $15 million of&nbsp;common stock. Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co. is the placement agent for such offering
program. In January 2014, we sold 658,489 shares of common stock under such offering program for approximate gross proceeds of $4 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January, 2014, we announced positive top-line results from our pivotal Phase 3 efficacy study of BEMA<SUP

January through March 2014, our employees and directors exercised approximately 0.7 million stock options, which net proceeds to us was $2.2 million. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February, 2014, we entered into a definitive Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors relating to a registered
direct offering by the Company of 7,500,000 shares of our common stock, par value $.001 per share. The shares were sold at a price of $8.00 per share, yielding gross offering proceeds of $60 million. The offering price per share was determined based
on an approximately 3.1% discount to the closing price of the common stock on February&nbsp;7, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We anticipate that the cash used in

to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee c/o Ernest R. De Paolantonio, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc, 801 Corporate Center Drive, Suite #210, Raleigh, NC 27607. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has established

compatibility with current board members, industry reputation, knowledge of our company generally, independence and ethnic and gender diversity. While diversity is considered as a board qualification criteria, it would not be weighted any more or

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">With respect to our employees and non-senior management, we will also take into consideration
local market data in determining appropriate compensation packages, and we have in the past relied on Radford to provide us with such data. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Elements
of Our Compensation Program and Why We Chose Each </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Main Compensation Components </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our company-wide compensation program, including for our NEOs, is broken down into three main components: base salary, performance cash bonuses
and potential long-term compensation in the form of stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs). We believe these three components constitute the minimum essential elements of a competitive compensation package in our industry. We also have a
Performance Long Term Incentive Plan for our NEOs and selected senior officers of our company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Salary </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Base salary is used to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of our NEOs as well as recognizing the
competitive nature of the biopharmaceutical industry. This is determined partially by evaluating our peer companies as well as the degree of responsibility and experience levels of our NEOs and their overall contributions to our company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Performance Bonus Plan </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have a performance bonus plan under which bonuses are paid to our NEOs based on achievement of extraordinary company performance goals and
objectives established by the Committee and/or the board of directors as well as on individual performance. The bonus program is discretionary and is intended to: (i)&nbsp;strengthen the connection between individual compensation and our
company&#146;s achievements; (ii)&nbsp;encourage teamwork among all disciplines within our company; (iii)&nbsp;reinforce our pay-for-performance philosophy by awarding higher bonuses to higher performing employees; and (iv)&nbsp;help ensure that our
cash compensation is competitive. Depending on the cash position of the company, the Committee and our board of directors have decided, from time to time and after consulting with the Chief Executive Officer, to not pay cash bonuses in order that we
may conserve cash and support ongoing development programs. Regardless of our cash position, we consistently grant annual merit-based stock options (and, more recently, RSUs) to continue incentivizing both our senior management and our employees.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on their employment agreements, each NEO is assigned a target payout under the performance bonus plan, expressed as a percentage of
base salary for the year. Actual payouts under the performance bonus plan are based on the achievement of corporate performance goals and an assessment of individual performance, each of which is separately weighted as a component of such
officer&#146;s target payout. For the NEOs, the corporate goals receive the highest weighting in order to ensure that the bonus system for our management team is closely tied to our corporate performance. Each employee also has specific individual
goals and objectives as well that are tied to the overall corporate goals. For employees, mid-year and end of year progress is reviewed with the employees&#146; managers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Equity Incentive Compensation </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We view long-term compensation, currently in the form of stock options and RSUs, generally vesting in annual increments over three years, as a
tool to align the interests of our NEOs and employees generally with the creation of stockholder value, to motivate our employees to achieve and exceed corporate and individual objectives and to encourage them to remain employed by the company.
While cash compensation is a significant component of employees&#146; overall compensation, the Committee and the board of directors (as well as our NEOs) believe that the driving force of any employee working in a small biotechnology company should
be strong equity participation. We believe that this not only creates the potential for substantial longer term corporate value but also serves to motivate employees and retain their loyalty and commitment with appropriate personal compensation.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Performance Long Term Incentive Plan </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2012, by unanimous written consent following significant planning and discussion (as well as discussion with our outside
compensation consultant Radford), the Committee approved the BDSI Performance Long Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to as the LTIP). The LTIP is designed as an incentive for our senior management (including our NEOs) to generate revenue for our
company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The LTIP consists of Restricted Stock Units (as defined under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, and which we refer to as
Performance RSUs) which are rights to acquire shares of our common stock. All Performance RSUs granted under the LTIP will be granted under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (as the same may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time) as
&#147;Performance Compensation Awards&#148; under such plan. The participants in the LTIP are either NEOs or senior officers of our company. </P>
 <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">67 </P>


<p Style='page-break-before:always'>
<HR  SIZE="3" style="COLOR:#999999" WIDTH="100%" ALIGN="CENTER">
<h5 align="left"><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of the LTIP began with our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and lasts through
our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2019. The total number of Performance RSUs covered by the LTIP is 1,078,000, of which 978,000 were awarded in 2012 (with 100,000 Performance RSUs being reserved for future hires). The Performance RSUs under
the LTIP did not vest upon granting, but instead are subject to potential vesting each year over the 8 year term of the LTIP depending on the achievement of revenue by our company, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. During 2013, 8,986
Performance RSUs vested. Performance RSUs will be valued on the day of issuance and will vest annually on the last day preceding the first open window after filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K based on the revenue achieved during the prior fiscal
year as a proportion of the total cumulative revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP (which we call the Predefined Cumulative Revenue). Predefined Cumulative Revenue is a predefined aggregate revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP
that was determined by the Committee in conjunction with our executive management. The Predefined Cumulative Revenue may be adjusted by the Committee upon the occurrence of extraordinary corporate events during the term of the LTIP (such as
acquisitions by our company of revenue generating businesses or assets). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Other Compensation </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to the main components of compensation outlined above, we also provide contractual severance and/or change in control benefits to
the NEOs as well as James A. McNulty, our Senior Vice President - Finance and Treasurer, Dr.&nbsp;Niraj Vasisht, our Senior Vice President &#151; Product Development and CTO, to Albert J. Medwar, our Vice President of Marketing, to George Ng, our
Senior Vice President and General Counsel and to David L. Acheson, our Vice President Sales and Managed Markets. We believe these severance or change in control benefits are important elements of our compensation program that assist us in retaining
talented individuals at the executive and senior managerial levels and that these arrangements help to promote stability and continuity of our executives and senior management team. Further, we believe that the interests of our stockholders will be
best served if the interests of these members of our management are aligned with theirs. We believe that providing change in control benefits lessens or eliminates any potential reluctance of members of our management to pursue potential change in
control transactions that may be in the best interests of the stockholders. We also believe that it is important to provide severance benefits to members of our management, to promote stability and focus on the job at hand. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also provide benefits to the executive officers that are generally available to all regular full-time employees of the company, including
our medical and dental insurance, life insurance and a 401(k) match for all individuals who participate in the 401(k) plan. At this time, we do not provide any perquisites to any of our NEOs. Further, we do not have deferred compensation plans,
pension arrangements or post-retirement health coverage for our executive officers or employees. All of our employees not specifically under contract are &#147;at-will&#148; employees, which means that their employment can be terminated at any time
for any reason by either us or the employee. Our NEOs (as well as certain of our senior managers) have employment contracts that provide lump sum compensation in the event of their termination without cause or, under certain circumstances, upon a
change of control. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Determination of Compensation Amounts </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A number of factors impact the determination of compensation amounts for our NEOs, including the individual&#146;s role in the company and
individual performance, competition for talent, each NEO&#146;s total compensation package, assessments of internal pay equity and industry data. Stock price performance has generally not been a factor in determining annual compensation because the
price of our common stock is subject to a variety of factors outside of our control. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Industry Survey Data </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In collaboration with Radford, we previously determined to establish and maintain a list of peer companies to best assure ourselves that we are
compensating our executives on a fair and reasonable basis. We have established two peer group reviews with Radford. The first group is for NEOs, which is based on a national review and was set forth above under the heading &#147;Objectives of our
Compensation Program.&#148; The second is intended for non-NEOs and focuses on similar sized companies located on the East Coast. The availability of peer data is used by the Committee strictly as a guide in determining compensation levels with
regard to salaries, cash bonuses and performance related annual stock option grants to all employees. However, the availability of this data does not imply that the Committee is under any obligation to exactly follow peer companies in compensation
matters. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Determination of Base Salaries </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a guideline for NEO base salary, we perform formal benchmarks against respective comparable positions in our established peer group. Our
guideline is to set targeted NEO salary ranges between the 25th and 50th percentile for comparable positions within our peer group. We then adjust salaries based on our assessment of our NEOs&#146; levels of responsibility, experience, overall
compensation structure and individual performance. In the event that a particular NEO salary meets the 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile, the Committee has the authority, should it desire, or if it is deemed
warranted, to go above that level but not to exceed the 75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the peer group. The Committee has the flexibility to raise this level in the event it becomes necessary; however the
Committee is not obliged to raise salaries purely on the availability of data. Merit-based increases to salaries of executive officers are based on our assessment of individual performance and the relationship to applicable salary ranges. Cost of
living adjustments may also be a part of that assessment. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Performance Bonus Plan </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrently with the beginning of each calendar year, preliminary corporate goals that reflect our business priorities for the coming year are
prepared by the CEO with input from the other executive officers. These goals are weighted by relative importance. The draft goals and proposed weightings are presented to the Committee and the board of directors and discussed, revised as necessary,
and then approved by the board of directors in January of each year. The Committee then reviews the final goals and their weightings to determine and confirm their appropriateness for use as performance measurements for purposes of the bonus
program. The goals and/or weightings may be re-visited during the year and potentially restated in the event of significant changes in corporate strategy or the occurrence of significant corporate events.&nbsp;Following the agreement with the board
of directors on the corporate objectives, the goals are then shared with all employees in a formal meeting(s), and are reviewed periodically throughout the year at monthly staff meetings and quarterly board of director meetings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The performance bonus plan for our executive officers in 2013 was adopted by the Committee in January 2009. The plan sets forth target bonus
opportunities, as a percentage of salary, based on the level of responsibility of the position, ranging up to 60% of salary for our Chief Executive Officer, and up to 40% of salary for our NEOs and up to 30% of salary for certain other officers. In
setting these percentages, the Committee determined that the above percentages were reasonable and in line with other companies at our stage of development. Each employee has the opportunity to achieve up to 100% of his targeted amount, depending on
how corporate goals and objectives are achieved, with variances on an employee by employee basis to be determined by our Chief Executive Officer in conjunction with the employees direct report as applicable. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Determination of Equity Incentive Compensation </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To assist us in assessing the reasonableness of our equity grant amounts, historically we have reviewed Radford supplied information and, prior
to Radford, we used information supplied by Equilar. Such information included stock option data from a cross-section of the companies in the above-mentioned surveys. Initial, on-hire stock option grant amounts have generally been targeted at the
25th to 50th percentile for that position or similar industry position, adjusted for internal equity, experience level of the individual and the individual&#146;s total mix of compensation and benefits provided in his or her offer package. Initial
on-hire grants typically vest over three years. The Committee agreed at the July 2012 board of directors meeting that NEO&#146;s and our other officers above the Director level would be able to achieve on an annual basis, a target equity grant up to
the 50<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile as determined by the peer group. Depending on the performance of the company, the NEO&#146;s and other officers were able to receive beyond 100% of their targeted annual equity
grant, but not in an amount to exceed the 75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the peer group. With respect to Director, and below, based on peer data, employees&#146; target equity grant is up to the 50<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile as determined, but not to exceed the 75<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">th</SUP> percentile of the peer group. However, the availability of this data does not imply that the
Committee is under any obligation to exactly follow its&#146; peer companies and has the flexibility to make annual adjustments. It is generally expected that the target amount would be granted if 100% performance is achieved. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Equity Grant Practices </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All stock options or RSUs granted to the NEOs are approved by the Committee. Exercise prices for options are set using a 30-day volume weighted
average price method which we define as the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on the trading day of the date of grant and the 30 trading days preceding that date. RSU grants are valued on the day of issuance and are
vested on the last day preceding an open window after filing our annual report for equity trading. These RSU&#146;s will vest annually in one-third increments on the last day preceding an open window after filing our annual report for equity trading
for company employees. Grants are generally made: (i)&nbsp;on the employee&#146;s start date and (ii)&nbsp;at board of directors meetings held each January and following annual performance reviews. However, grants have been made at other times
during the year. The size of year-end grants for each NEO is assessed against our internal equity guidelines. Current market conditions for grants for comparable positions and internal equity may also be assessed. Also, grants may be made in
connection with promotions or job related changes in responsibilities. In addition, on occasion, the Committee may make additional special awards for extraordinary individual or company performance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Compensation Setting Process </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Near the end of the year and at an in person meeting held each January, the board of directors and Committee assess our overall corporate
performance and discuss the relative achievement of the corporate goals. The relative achievement of each goal is assessed and quantified and the summation of the individual components results in the corporate goal rating. The independent directors
of the board (three of whom comprise the Committee) meet in executive session or confer privately to further discuss and approve the final corporate goals rating, expressed as a percentage. A majority vote of the committee is sufficient to approve
the final disbursement of salary increases, cash bonuses and option or RSU grants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also near the end of the year, the CEO evaluates the
individual performance of each NEO (other than himself) and provides the Committee with an assessment of the performance of each other NEO. In determining the individual performance ratings of the NEOs, we assess performance against a number of
factors, including each NEO&#146;s relative contributions to our corporate goals, demonstrated career growth, level of performance in the face of available resources and other challenges, and the respective officer&#146;s department&#146;s overall
performance. This assessment is conducted in a holistic fashion, in contrast to the summation of individual components as is done to arrive at the corporate goal rating. </P>
 <p STYLE="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt ; font-size:8pt">&nbsp;</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">69 </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following a qualitative assessment of individual NEO&#146;s performance, our policies provide
guidelines for translating this performance assessment into a numerical rating. Both the initial qualitative assessment and the translation into a numerical rating are made by the Committee on a discretionary basis. We believe that conducting a
discretionary assessment for the individual component of the NEOs&#146; performance provides for flexibility in the evaluation of our NEOs and their adaptability to addressing potential changes in company priorities throughout the year. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Committee looks to the CEO&#146;s performance assessments of the other NEOs and his recommendations regarding a performance rating for

completion of company objectives at mid-year. Additionally, this was done to recognize all of our employees&#146; efforts and to further motivate our employees to continue their efforts for the remainder of the year and to ensure positive completion
of all of our 2013 corporate objectives. The cost associated with this action amounted to a total increase in salaries of approximately $0.11 million, and the cost of providing for the issuance of 50% of cash bonuses was approximately $0.62 million
in the aggregate. In January 2014, the Committee agreed that each employee would receive 100% of the target cash bonuses for the full year 2013, which is approximately $1.31 million in the aggregate (50% was previously paid pursuant to the above

will receive the change in control benefits described in the agreements only if there is both (1)&nbsp;a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in the agreements) and (2)&nbsp;a termination by us of the applicable person&#146;s employment
&#147;without cause&#148; or a resignation by the applicable persons for &#147;good reason&#148; (as defined in the agreements) within a specified time period prior to or following the Change in Control. We believe this double trigger requirement
creates the potential to maximize stockholder value because it prevents an unintended windfall to management as no benefits are triggered solely in the event of a Change in Control while providing appropriate incentives to act in furtherance of a
change in control that may be in the best interests of the stockholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Accounting and Tax Considerations </I></P>

her severance from our company in connection with a change in control. We consider the adverse tax liabilities imposed by Code Sections 280G and 4999, as well as other competitive factors, when structuring post-termination compensation payable to
our executive officers and generally provide a mechanism for a &#147;better after tax&#148; result for the NEO, which we believe is a reasonable balance between our interests, on the one hand, and the executive&#146;s compensation on the other. </P>

Equity Incentive Plan is: (i)&nbsp;to align our interests and recipients of options under the plan by increasing the proprietary interest of such recipients in our growth and success, and (ii)&nbsp;to advance our interests by providing additional
incentives to officers, key employees and well-qualified non-employee directors and consultants who provide services to us, who are responsible for our management and growth, or otherwise contribute to the conduct and direction of its business,
operations and affairs. The Compensation Committee of our board of directors administers our incentive plan, selects the persons to whom options are granted and fixes the terms of such options. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Options may be awarded during the ten-year term of the plan to our employees (including employees who are directors), or consultants who are
not employees and our other affiliates. Our plan provides for the grant of options that qualify as incentive stock options, or Incentive Stock Options, under Section&nbsp;422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and options which are
not Incentive Stock Options, or Non-Statutory Stock Options, as well as restricted stock and other awards. Only our employees or employees of our subsidiaries may be granted Incentive Stock Options. Our affiliates or consultants or others as may be
permitted by our board of directors, may be granted Non-Statutory Stock Options. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Options to purchase 4,192,927 shares of our common stock

compensation consultant Radford), the Committee approved the LTIP. The LTIP is designed as an incentive for our senior management (including our NEOs) to generate revenue for our company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The LTIP consists of RSUs (as defined under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan) which are rights to acquire shares of our common stock. All
Performance RSUs granted under the LTIP will be granted under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (as the same may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time) as &#147;Performance Compensation Awards&#148; under such plan. The participants
in the LTIP are either NEOs or senior officers of our company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of the LTIP began with our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31,
2012 and lasts through our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2019. The total number of Performance RSUs covered by the LTIP is 1,078,000, of which 978,000 were awarded in 2012 (with 100,000 Performance RSUs being reserved for future hires). A
total of 8,986 RSUs vested during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The Performance RSUs under the LTIP did not vest upon granting, but instead are subject to potential vesting each year over the 8 year term of the LTIP depending on the
achievement of revenue by our company, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K). Performance RSUs will be valued on the day of issuance and will vest annually on the last day preceding the first open window after filing our Annual Report on
Form 10-K based on the revenue achieved during the prior fiscal year as a proportion of the total cumulative revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP (which we call the Predefined Cumulative Revenue). Predefined Cumulative Revenue is a
predefined aggregate revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP that was determined by the Committee in conjunction with our executive management. The Predefined Cumulative Revenue may be adjusted by the Committee upon the occurrence of
extraordinary corporate events during the term of the LTIP (such as acquisitions by our company of revenue generating businesses or assets). </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To the Board of Directors of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of
December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146; (deficit) equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. We also have audited the
Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission &#150;
1992 (COSO). The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item&nbsp;9A&#151;Controls and Procedures in the Company&#146;s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2013, based on criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission &#150; 1992 (COSO). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2013, the Company recognized a net loss of approximately $57 million and, at December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company had incurred cumulative net losses of approximately $151 million.
Management&#146;s plans in regard to this matter are described in Note 2. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP </P>

formulations of previously approved therapeutics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As used herein, the Company&#146;s common stock, par value $.001 per share, is referred

realized value of its investments. The Company places cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial institutions in the United States. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation covers $250,000 for substantially all depository accounts. The
Company may from time to time have amounts on deposit in excess of the insured limits. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company had approximately $22.8 million, which exceed these insured limits. </P>

costs are reported as revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company acts as a principal, has discretion to choose suppliers, bears credit risk and may perform part of the services required in the transactions.
Therefore, these reimbursements are treated as revenue to the Company.&nbsp;The actual expenses creating the reimbursements are reflected as research and development expense. </P>

commercial sales. For those product candidates that have not yet been so approved, there is a risk that they will not receive necessary approval. If approval is denied or delayed, it may have a material adverse impact on the Company. In addition,
the Company&#146;s products compete in rapidly changing, highly competitive markets which are characterized by advances in scientific discovery, changes in customer requirements, evolving regulatory requirements and developing industry standards.
Any failure by the Company to anticipate or to respond adequately to scientific developments, changes in customer requirements, changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards, or any significant delays in the development or introduction of
products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business, operating results and future cash flows. </P>

with Meda and Endo, and its activities may be impacted if these relationships are disrupted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Key components used in the manufacture of

reduce control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. Also, if the supply of any components is interrupted, components from alternative suppliers may not be available in sufficient volumes within required time frames, if at all, to meet the
Company&#146;s obligations under the Meda supply agreements. This could delay timely commercialization efforts by Meda, causing the Company to lose royalty revenue and potentially harming its reputation. </P>

indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In the course of the evaluation of the potential impairment of Goodwill, either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment may be performed. If a qualitative evaluation determines that no
impairment exists, then no further analysis is performed. If a qualitative evaluation is unable to determine whether impairment has occurred, a quantitative evaluation is performed. The quantitative impairment analysis involves a two-step process.
Step one involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates (the Company&#146;s enterprise value) to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no
impairment. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company determines the implied fair value of goodwill and records an impairment charge for any excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.
There were no goodwill impairment charges in 2013, 2012 or 2011. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">GAAP defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. GAAP also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. GAAP describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: </P>

the Company has entered into certain other financial instruments and contracts, such as debt financing arrangements and freestanding warrants with features that are either not afforded equity classification, embody risks not clearly and closely

all of the requisite assumptions (including trading volatility, estimated terms and risk free rates) necessary to fairly value these instruments. Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and
subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. In addition, option-based techniques are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the
Company&#146;s trading market price which has high-historical volatility. Since derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair values, the Company&#146;s income will reflect the volatility in these estimate and
assumption changes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Recent accounting pronouncements: </I></B></P>

to reduce the cost and complexity of performing an impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets by simplifying how an entity tests those assets for impairment and to improve consistency in impairment testing guidance. The new guidance
allows an entity the option to make a qualitative assessment about the likelihood that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test. ASU 2012-02 was effective for annual and
interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September&nbsp;15, 2012 and early adoption was permitted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company

 <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2006 and September 2007, the Company entered into certain agreements with Meda to develop and commercialize the
ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product, a drug treatment for breakthrough cancer pain delivered utilizing the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology. The aforementioned agreements
relate to the United States, Mexico and Canada (such agreements, the &#147;Meda U.S. Agreements&#148;) and to certain countries in Europe (such agreements, the &#147;Meda EU Agreements&#148;, together with Meda U.S. Agreements, the &#147;Meda
Agreements&#148;). They carry license terms that commence on the date of first commercial sale in each respective territory and end on the earlier of the entrance of a generic product to the market or upon expiration of the patents, which begin to
expire in 2020. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company determined that upon inception of both the U.S. and EU Meda arrangements all deliverables are to be considered
one combined unit of accounting since the fair value of the undelivered license was not determinable and the research and development efforts provided do not have stand-alone value apart from the license. As such, all cash payments from Meda that
were related to these deliverables were recorded as deferred revenue.&nbsp;Upon commencement of the license term (date of first commercial sale in each territory), the license and certain deliverables associated with research and development
services were deliverable to Meda. The first commercial sale in the U.S. occurred in October 2009. As a result, $59.7 million of the aggregate milestones and services revenue was recognized as revenue. The first commercial sale in a European country
occurred in October 2012.&nbsp;As a result, $17.5 million was recognized as revenue, which included $5.0 million in milestones received during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012.&nbsp;At&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2013, there was remaining deferred
revenue of $1.3 million which is related to the Meda research and development services. As time progresses, the Company will continue to estimate the time required for ongoing obligations, and adjust the remaining deferred revenue accordingly on a
quarterly basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company earns royalties based on a percentage of net sales revenue of the ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product. The Company earned $1.8 million and $1.1 million in product royalty revenue for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company has incurred cost of product
royalties of approximately $2.1 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which included minimum royalty expenses that the Company is obligated to pay CDC IV, LLC (&#147;CDC&#148;) and NB Athyrium
LLC (&#147;Athyrium&#148;) regardless of actual sales. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Upon delivery of the license to Meda, the Company determined that each of the
undelivered obligations had stand-alone value to Meda as these post-commercialization services encompass additional clinical trials on different patient groups but do not require further product development and these services and product supply
obligations can be provided by third-party providers available to Meda. The Company also obtained third-party evidence of fair value for the other research and development services and other service obligations, based on hourly rates billed by
unrelated third-party providers for similar services contracted by the Company. The Company has obtained third-party evidence of fair value of the product supply deliverable based on the outsourced contract manufacturing cost charged to the Company
from the third-party supplier of the product. The arrangements do not contain any general rights of return. Therefore, the remaining deliverables to the arrangements have been accounted for as three separate units of accounting to include
(1)&nbsp;product supply, (2)&nbsp;research and development services for the ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product and (3)&nbsp;the combined requirements related to the remaining other service-related obligations
due Meda to include participation in committees and certain other specified services. The estimated portion of the upfront payments of approximately $1.2 million (under the Meda U.S. Agreements) and $0.1 million (under the Meda EU Agreements)
attributed to these other service-related obligations will be recognized as revenue as services are provided through expiration of the license terms, as defined above. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has determined that it is acting as a principal under the Meda Agreements and, as such, will record product supply revenue,
research and development services revenue and other services revenue amounts on a gross basis in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;12, 2012, the Company announced the postponement of the U.S. re-launch of
ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> following the initiation of the class-wide REMS until the product formulation could be modified to address two appearance-related issues raised by FDA during an inspection of the
manufacturing facility of the Company&#146;s North American manufacturing partner for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, Aveva Drug Delivery Systems, Inc. (&#147;Aveva&#148;). Specifically, the FDA identified the
formation of microscopic crystals and a fading of the color in the mucoadhesive layer during the 24-month shelf life of the product.&nbsp;While these changes do not affect the product&#146;s underlying integrity, safety or performance, the FDA
believes that the fading of the color in particular may potentially confuse patients, necessitating a modification of the product and product specification before additional product can be manufactured and distributed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The source of microcrystal formation and the potential for fading of the product was found to be specific to a buffer used in the manufacturing
process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> has been reformulated and the Company&#146;s believes the appearance issues have been resolved. Meda,
the Company&#146;s commercial partner, is working to determine the content and timing of the submission to FDA. Once submitted, FDA&#146;s review of the application may take up to 6 months. If the submission is made before mid-2014, and approved by
FDA, the relaunch could occur by years end, otherwise, the relaunch would move to sometime 2015. </P>

million from Meda in conjunction with the first country registration and pricing approval for BREAKYL&#153; (tradename for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in the EU). A final milestone payment related to the EU of
$2.5 million was paid at the time of commercial launch, which occurred in October 2012.&nbsp;BREAKYL&#153; is commercialized in the EU by Meda. </P>

Lohmann Therapie-Systeme AG (&#147;LTS&#148;), under which LTS will manufacture and supply the Company its BREAKYL&#153; product for distribution outside of the U.S. and Canada. The Company is required to supply BREAKYL&#153; product to Meda, Kunwha

development services, the costs of clinical trial materials and other factors. Also considered were entity specific assumptions regarding the results of clinical trials, the likelihood of FDA approval of the subject product and the likelihood of
commercialization based in part on the Company&#146;s prior agreements with the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on this analysis, $15.6 million of the up-front license fee was allocated to the license (which was estimated to have a value
significantly in excess of $30 million), and $14.4 million to&nbsp;clinical development services (which is inclusive of the cost of CTM).&nbsp;Although the intellectual property component was considered a separate deliverable, no distinct amount of
the up-front payment was assigned to this deliverable because the Company determined the deliverable to be perfunctory. In April 2012, the patent being sought by the Company was granted as described further below, and in May 2012, the applicable
intellectual property milestone payment of $15 million was received and recognized as revenue. The amount allocated to the license was recognized as revenue in January 2012. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The portion of the upfront license fee allocated to the clinical development services deliverable ($14.4 million) is being recognized as those
services are performed.&nbsp;The Company estimates that such clinical development services will extend into the first half of 2015.&nbsp;Based on the estimated proportion of those services performed through December&nbsp;31, 2013, $5.2 million was
recognized as revenue in fiscal year 2012 and $6.3 million was recognized as revenue in fiscal year 2013. As a result, $2.9 million remains deferred at December&nbsp;31, 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company analyzed the milestone payments noted above to determine if such milestones are substantive. This determination included an
analysis of the Company&#146;s performance to achieve each milestone, the enhancement of value of the delivered items, the timing of performance related to the milestone, and the reasonability of the milestone relative to all the deliverables and
payment terms. The Company concluded that each of the milestones is substantive. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of the Endo Agreement shall last, on a
country-by-country basis, until the later of: (i)&nbsp;10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine in a particular country or (ii)&nbsp;the date on which the
last valid claim of the Company&#146;s patents covering BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine in a particular country has expired or been invalidated. The Endo Agreement shall be subject to termination:
(i)&nbsp;by Endo, at any time, upon a specific amount of prior written notice to the Company, (ii)&nbsp;by Endo and the Company upon mutual written agreement, (iii)&nbsp;by either party upon a material default or breach of the Endo Agreement and
such default or breach is not cured within a specified timeframe, (iv)&nbsp;the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of either party or (v)&nbsp;by the Company if Endo does not meet certain diligence obligations outside of the United States. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;16, 2012, the Company announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a Notice of Allowance regarding its patent
application (No. 13/184306), which patent will extend the exclusivity of the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> drug delivery technology for the Company&#146;s
BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine and BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">TM</SUP> product candidates from 2020 to 2027. On April&nbsp;17, 2012, the Company announced that this patent was
granted. As a result, pursuant to the Endo Agreement, the Company received a milestone payment from Endo in the amount of $15 million in May 2012. As discussed above, this milestone had been evaluated to be a substantive milestone, and therefore was
recognized as revenue when the milestone was received. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The remaining milestone payments are expected to be recognized as revenue as and if
they are achieved, except that one milestone is contingently refundable for a period of time. Revenue related to that milestone is expected to be recognized as refund provisions as defined in the agreement expire. Sale threshold payments and
sales-based royalties will be recognized as they accrue under the terms of the Endo Agreement. </P>

$2 million outstanding under the Tolmar note (pursuant to which the Company acquired the North American rights to the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology) and, upon receipt of such payment (i)&nbsp;the related

License Agreement (the &#147;CDLA Amendment&#148;) by and among CDC V, LLC (&#147;CDC&#148;), NB Athyrium LLC (&#147;Athyrium&#148;).&nbsp;Athyrium holds certain rights, acquired from CDC, to receive royalties on sales of ONSOLIS<SUP

increase the royalty rate to be received by CDC/Athyrium retroactively to the initial launch date of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and, accordingly, the Company recorded $0.3 million as additional cost of product
royalties for year ended December&nbsp;31, 2011. In addition, certain terms of the CLDA were amended and restated to clarify that royalty payments by the Company under the CDLA will be calculated based on Meda&#146;s sales of ONSOLIS<SUP

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The difference between these two calculations resulted in a $1.1 million overpayment by the Company which was recorded as a prepayment. As a
result, the Company did not pay any of the quarterly royalty payments, including any 2011 payments due to CDC/Athyrium until the December&nbsp;31, 2011 royalty calculation, which the Company paid during the first quarter of 2012. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;2, 2010, MonoSol Rx, LLC (&#147;MonoSol&#148;) filed an action against the Company and its commercial partners for ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in the Federal District Court of New Jersey (&#147;DNJ&#148;) for alleged patent infringement and false marking. The Company was formally served in this matter on January&nbsp;19, 2011. MonoSol
claims that the Company&#146;s manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which has never been disclosed publicly and which the Company and its partners maintain as a trade secret, infringes its
patent (United States Patent No.&nbsp;7,824,588) (the &#147; &#145;588 Patent&#148;). Of note, the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology itself is not at issue in the case, nor is BEMA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> Buprenorphine or BUNAVAIL&#153;, but rather only the manner in which ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which incorporates the BEMA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology, is manufactured. Pursuant to its complaint, MonoSol is seeking an unspecified amount of damages, attorney&#146;s fees and an injunction preventing future infringement of
MonoSol&#146;s patents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company strongly refutes as without merit MonoSol&#146;s assertion of patent infringement, which relates to
its confidential, proprietary manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. On February&nbsp;23, 2011, the Company filed its initial answer in this case. In the Company&#146;s answer, the Company stated
its position that their products, methods and/or components do not infringe MonoSol&#146;s &#145;588 Patent because they do not meet the limitations of any valid claim of such patent. Moreover, in the Company&#146;s answer, the Company stated its
position that MonoSol&#146;s &#145;588 Patent is actually invalid and unenforceable for failure to comply with one or more of the requirements of applicable U.S. patent law. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;12, 2011, the Company filed a request for inter partes reexamination in the United States Patent and Trademark Office
(&#147;USPTO&#148;) of MonoSol&#146;s &#145;588 Patent demonstrating that all claims of such patent were anticipated by or obvious in the light of prior art references, including several prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO,
and thus invalid. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Company filed in court a motion for stay pending the outcome of the reexamination proceedings, which subsequently was granted due to the results of the USPTO proceedings as described below. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;28, 2011, the Company announced that it was informed by the USPTO that it had rejected all 191 claims of MonoSol&#146;s
&#145;588 Patent. On January&nbsp;20, 2012, the Company filed requests for reexamination before the USPTO of MonoSol&#146;s US patent No 7,357,891 (the &#147;&#145;891 Patent&#148;), and No 7,425,292 (the &#147;&#145;292 Patent&#148;), the two
additional patents asserted by MonoSol, demonstrating that all claims of those two patents were anticipated by or obvious in the light of prior art references, including prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and thus invalid.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In February and March 2012, respectively, the USPTO granted the requests for reexamination we filed with respect to MonoSol&#146;s
&#145;292 and &#145;891 Patents. In its initial office action in each, the USPTO rejected every claim in each patent. Based on the action of the USPTO on these three patent reexaminations, the court in the Company&#146;s case with MonoSol conducted
a status conference on March&nbsp;7, 2012, at which it granted the Company&#146;s motion to stay the case pending final outcome of the reexamination proceedings in the USPTO. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As expected, in the &#145;891 Patent and &#145;292 Patent Ex Parte Reexamination proceedings, MonoSol amended the claims several times and made
multiple declarations and arguments in an attempt to overcome the rejections made by the USPTO. These amendments, declarations and other statements regarding the claim language significantly narrowed the scope of their claims in these two patents.
In the case of the &#145;891 Patent, not one of the original claims survived reexamination and five separate amendments were filed confirming the Company&#146;s position that the patent was invalid. Additionally, the Company believes that arguments
and admissions made by MonoSol prevent it from seeking a broader construction during any subsequent litigation by employing arguments or taking positions that contradict those made during prosecution. </P>

issued August&nbsp;21, 2012 (Reexamined Patent No.&nbsp;7,357,891C1 or the &#145;891C1 Patent). A Reexamination Certificate for MonoSol&#146;s &#145;292 Patent in its amended form was issued on July&nbsp;3, 2012 (Reexamined Patent
No.&nbsp;7,425,292C1 or the &#145;292C1 Patent). These actions by the USPTO confirm the invalidity of the original patents and through the narrowing of the claims in the reissued patents strengthens the Company&#146;s original assertion that its
products and technologies do not infringe on MonoSol&#146;s original patents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Inter partes reviews, a new USPTO process to review the
patentability of one or more claims of patents, was enacted in September, 2012. As such, on June&nbsp;12, 2013, despite the Company&#146;s previously noted success in the prior ex parte reexaminations for the &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents, the
Company availed ourselves of this new process and filed requests for inter partes reviews on the narrowed yet reexamined patents, the &#145;292C1 and &#145;891C1 Patents, to challenge their validity and continue to strengthen its position. This
inter partes review process allows the Company to actively participate in the reviews and address any of MonoSol&#146;s arguments and representations made during the review process, which heightens the Company&#146;s ability to invalidate these
patents. On November&nbsp;13, 2013, the USPTO decided not to institute the two inter partes reviews for the &#145;891C1 and &#145;292C1 Patents. The USPTO&#146;s decision was purely on statutory grounds and based on a technicality (in that the IPRs
were not filed within what the UPSTO determined to be the statutory period) rather than substantive grounds. Thus, even though the inter partes reviews were not instituted, the USPTO decision preserves the Company&#146;s right to raise the same
arguments at a later time (e.g., during litigation). Regardless, the Company&#146;s assertion that its products and technologies do not infringe the original &#145;292 and &#145;891 Patents and, now, the reexamined &#145;891C1 and &#145;292C1
Patents remains the same. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Importantly, in the case of MonoSol&#146;s &#145;588 Patent, the USPTO on July&nbsp;20, 2012 issued a second
Office Action closing prosecution and rejecting for a second time all claims as anticipated or obvious. It also rejected the amended claims proposed by MonoSol as unclear and lacking support. Then, on January&nbsp;23, 2013, the USPTO issued a Right
of Appeal Notice, rejecting all claims of the &#145;588 Patent and closing reexamination proceedings. This action confirms that all claims of this patent are also invalid, but unlike &#145;292 and &#145;891, the USPTO has not found that any amended
or narrower claims should be granted. On February&nbsp;22, 2013, MonoSol filed both a Notice of Appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences and a Request for Continuing Examination of the &#145;588 Patent.&nbsp;On March&nbsp;12, 2013,
the Company filed a petition requesting the USPTO to deny MonoSol&#146;s February&nbsp;22, 2013 Request to Continue Examination and to allow the proceedings to go to an appeal. Subsequently, on July&nbsp;3, 2013, the USPTO denied MonoSol&#146;s
February&nbsp;22, 2013 Request to Continue Examination. After reviewing MonoSol&#146;s Appeal Brief (filed June&nbsp;24, 2013) and the Company&#146;s Respondent&#146;s Brief (filed July&nbsp;24, 2013), the USPTO formally initiated the appeals
process with the Examiner&#146;s Answer on August&nbsp;8, 2013, which affirmed the rejection of all the claims in the &#145;588 Patent. An oral hearing for the appeal, in which both parties will have an opportunity to make arguments before the
Patent Trial&nbsp;&amp; Appeal Board (&#147;PTAB&#148;) has been scheduled for March&nbsp;26, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on the Company&#146;s original
assertion that our proprietary manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> does not infringe on patents held by MonoSol, and the denial and subsequent narrowing of the claims on the two reissued
patents MonoSol has asserted against the Company while the third has had all claims rejected by the USPTO, the Company remains very confident in its original stated position regarding this matter. Thus far, the Company has proven that the
&#147;original&#148; &#145;292 and &#145;891 patents in light of their reissuance with fewer and narrower claims were indeed invalid and the third and final patent, &#145;588, has had all claims rejected and appears to have had a similar fate.
Importantly, the Company will continue to defend this case vigorously, and anticipates that MonoSol&#146;s claims against the Company will ultimately be rejected. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Litigation Related To BUNAVAIL&#153; </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&nbsp;29, 2013, Reckitt Benckiser, Inc., RB Pharmaceuticals Limited, and MonoSol (collectively, the &#147;RB Plaintiffs&#148;) filed
an action against the Company relating to its BUNAVAIL&#153; product in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina for alleged patent infringement. BUNAVAIL&#153; is a proposed treatment for opioid dependence. The RB
Plaintiffs claim that the formulation for BUNAVAIL&#153;, which has never been disclosed publicly, infringes its patent (United States Patent No.&nbsp;8,475,832) (the &#147;&#145;832 Patent&#148;). The Company believes this is another
anticompetitive attempt by the RB Plaintiffs to distract the Company&#146;s efforts from commercializing BUNAVAIL&#153;. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company
believes that this action is in response to a 2013 decision wherein the FDA recently ruled in favor of the Company&#146;s position in two Citizen Petitions filed by the RB Plaintiffs that sought to prevent the FDA from accepting and filing the
Company&#146;s NDA for BUNAVAIL&#153;. The two Citizen Petitions, filed on December&nbsp;2, 2011 and August&nbsp;13, 2013, respectively, included requests that the FDA refuse to accept for filing any NDAs submitted using the 505 (b)(2) regulatory
pathway for buprenorphine/naloxone products consisting of a polymer film for application to the buccal mucosal membranes (such as BUNAVAIL&#153;), unless such application references the NDA for
Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual film (and not the Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> sublingual tablet NDA). Suboxone<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is an approved product for opioid dependence. The requirement to reference the Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> film formulation, which is under patent
exclusivity with Orange Book-listed patents, including the &#145;832 Patent, was aimed at delaying the eventual approval of BUNAVAIL&#153;. FDA did not agree with these arguments and in its decision on September&nbsp;18, 2013, it denied the requests
and subsequently, accepted and filed the BUNAVAIL&#153; NDA. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company believes that the RB Plaintiff&#146;s claim of patent infringement has no more
validity than the recently rejected Citizen Petitions, but is being used as another anticompetitive attempt to distract the Company in our efforts toward commercializing BUNAVAIL&#153;. We look forward to the FDA&#146;s review of the BUNAVAIL&#153;
NDA as it moves toward the June&nbsp;7, 2014 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#147;PDUFA&#148;) date when we expect a response from FDA on our NDA for BUNAVAIL&#153;. In the meantime, the Company strongly refutes as without merit the RB
Plaintiffs&#146; assertion of patent infringement and will vigorously defend the lawsuit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;13, 2013, the Company filed a
motion to dismiss RB Plaintiff&#146;s suit based on insufficient pleadings and lack of standing. In response, RB Plaintiffs filed its opposition to the Company&#146;s motion to dismiss on January&nbsp;22, 2014. The Company filed its reply to
RB&#146;s opposition to the Company&#146;s motion to dismiss on February&nbsp;10, 2014. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;15, 2014, the Company filed a
request for inter partes review in the USPTO of the &#145;832 Patent demonstrating that certain claims of such patent were anticipated by or obvious in the light of prior art references, including prior art references not previously considered by
the USPTO, and thus, invalid. On January&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company filed in Court a motion for stay pending the outcome of the inter partes review proceedings. </P>
