product, meaning it has less abuse and addiction potential compared to Schedule II products such as morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone. BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is also commercially available in Canada
following market authorization from Health Canada in June 2017 and our subsequent exclusive agreement with Purdue Pharma (Canada) in July 2017 for the licensing and distribution rights of

in patients with chronic pain severe enough to require daily, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">around-the-clock,</FONT></FONT> long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.
The approval of BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was based on the two double-blind, placebo-controlled, enriched-enrollment Phase 3 studies. A total of 1,559 opioid experienced (study
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">BUP-307)</FONT> and opioid na&iuml;ve <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">(BUP-308)</FONT> patients received study drug. In both studies, BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> demonstrated a
consistent, statistically significant improvement in patient-reported pain relief at every week from baseline to week 12, compared to placebo. BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is available in seven dose strengths,
allowing for flexible dosing ranging from 75 mcg to 900 mcg every 12 hours. This enables physicians to individualize titration and treatment based on the optimally effective and tolerable dose for each patient. The FDA&#146;s approval of BELBUCA<SUP

favorable early healthcare provider feedback and positive patient experience with regard to efficacy, tolerability and the buccal film formulation. Endo also filed a submission for BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
with Health Canada in the second quarter of 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;8, 2016, we announced an agreement with Endo terminating Endo&#146;s
licensing of rights for BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. This announcement followed a strategic decision made by Endo to discontinue commercial efforts of its branded pain business. On January&nbsp;6, 2017, we
announced the closing of the transaction to reacquire the license to BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> from Endo. As a result, the worldwide rights to BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Behind a revised commercialized plan that took into consideration the current climate for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, we initially
leveraged our existing sales force to capitalize on commercial synergies with BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP><SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top"> </SUP>for a focused commercial approach targeting
identified healthcare providers which we believe creates the potential to incrementally grow BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> sales without the requirement of significant resources. In
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-January</FONT> 2017, we completed the expansion and training of our sales force, allowing for promotion of BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> to commence in late January. As a
Schedule III opioid (meaning that buprenorphine, the active ingredient in BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, has less abuse and addiction potential compared to Schedule II opioids such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and
morphine), BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is differentiated from other opioids and has the potential to address some of the most critical issues facing healthcare providers treating chronic pain with prescription
opioids &#150; abuse, misuse, addiction and the risk of overdose. These elements are at the center of the opioid crisis in our country and led to the 2017 declaration by the President of a Public Health Emergency. We are working with health care
providers as well as various government agencies to provide education on buprenorphine and these key differences. As part of these efforts, we participated in a round table meeting convened in Washington D.C. by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (or HHS) in October 2017 with nine other manufacturers to discuss efforts to advance pain management therapies and the treatment of opioid use disorder in response to the opioid crisis. The meeting provided an opportunity for us to
share the work we are doing to use our innovative drug delivery technology and products and make available alternative formulations of buprenorphine based on knowledge that it provides an effective, Schedule III alternative to other more addictive
opioids. Based on this and other meetings we will continue to have with government policy makers, we are optimistic about the future role of buprenorphine for chronic pain management. </P>

a steady increase in BELBUCA prescription sales through 2017, there was also an increase in the use of higher doses of BELBUCA as healthcare providers became more comfortable with the use of BELBUCA and awareness of the full range of doses
increased. In 2016, 19% of BELBUCA prescriptions were for doses of 450 mcg or greater, compared to 33% in 2017. As such, the average price per prescription increased. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2017, we announced the approval of BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP><SUP

BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in Canada. According to the&nbsp;Canadian Pain Society, pain is the most common reason for seeking healthcare, with 1 in 5 Canadian adults suffering from chronic pain. We view Purdue
as a strong partner for BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in Canada given its long history and commitment to pain management as well as its expertise and strong presence in the Canadian pain market. In return for the

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the widespread use of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence and the need for improved means of delivery to
address existing administration challenges present an important commercial opportunity. Therefore, we developed a BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone specifically for the treatment
of opioid dependence. The product combines a &#147;high dose&#148; of buprenorphine along with an abuse deterrent agent, naloxone. BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> provides us with an opportunity to compete in the
growing opioid dependence market which, according to Symphony Health, exceeded $2.5&nbsp;billion in sales in the U.S in 2017, an increase of 14% over the prior year. </P>

BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and the reference product, Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> tablets. The results demonstrated that the two key pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum

through&#148; the effects of other medications being used to control persistent pain) in opioid tolerant patients with cancer. In May 2010, regulatory approvals were granted for Canada, and in October 2010, approval was obtained in the European
Union (which we refer to herein as E.U.) through the E.U.&#146;s Decentralized Procedure, with Germany acting as the reference member state. ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is marketed in Europe under the trade-name

ensure informed risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure appropriate use. The TIRF REMS program was implemented in March 2012. The approved program covers
all marketed transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program which will enhance patient safety while limiting the potential administrative burden on prescribers and their patients. One common program also ended the disparity in prescribing

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our corporate focus is &#147;specialty pharmaceuticals&#148; with characteristics that provide substantial points of differentiation from
existing products. Our product portfolio is based on the application of drug delivery technologies and/or new dosage forms/indications to existing drugs for the creation of novel products. We then seek proprietary protection and FDA approval, and
subsequently commercialize these products ourselves or through partners. We believe that research and development efforts focused on novel dose forms of FDA approved drugs is less risky than attempting to discover new drugs, sometimes called new
chemical entities (known as NCEs). Our corporate focus came to initial fruition with the FDA&#146;s approval of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (fentanyl buccal soluble film) in 2009 and was replicated in 2014 with
the approval of BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (buprenorphine and naloxone) buccal film and again in 2015 with the approval of BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (buprenorphine)
buccal film. It is our goal to replicate this success with our current product candidates, and to identify new product candidates suitable for this development strategy that would add significant commercial value to us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An important part of our strategy is the utilization of FDA&#146;s 505(b)(2) NDA process for approval. Under the 505(b)(2) process, we are
able to seek FDA approval of a new dosage form, dosage regimen or new indication of an FDA approved drug. This regulation enables us to partially rely on the FDA&#146;s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for the drug, including clinical
and nonclinical testing, and thereby reduce, although not eliminate, the need to engage in these costly and time-consuming activities. A typical development program for a 505(b)(2) submission will include: </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In aggregate, the agreement was worth up to $180&nbsp;million to us if all milestones or
thresholds are met, which includes an upfront <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-refundable</FONT> license fee of $30&nbsp;million (received January 2012), as well as intellectual property, development, regulatory and commercial milestone and
sales threshold payments. We would have received a tiered mid to upper teen royalty on U.S. net sales of BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and a tiered mid to upper single-digit royalty on sales outside the U.S. One
of the key intellectual property milestones under our Endo Agreement was achieved when, in April 2012, the USPTO granted US Patent No.&nbsp;8,147,866 (issued from US Patent Application No.&nbsp;13/184,306), which will extend the exclusivity of the
BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> drug delivery technology for BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (as well as BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> discussed
below) from 2020 to 2027. As a result (and included in the aforementioned $180&nbsp;million if all milestones or thresholds are met), we received a milestone payment in the amount of $15&nbsp;million in May 2012, and also received an additional
milestone payment of $20&nbsp;million which was paid at the time of approval of a NDA by the FDA for BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The aforementioned $20&nbsp;million patent-related payment will be earned over
the extended patent period from 2020 to 2027. As mentioned above, the obligations of this milestone were extinguished upon the closing of the termination arrangements. Additionally, we achieved another milestone with the locking of the database for
our Phase 3 opioid naive clinical study on January&nbsp;17, 2014. For the achievement of this milestone, per the terms of the agreement, we were due a milestone payment in the amount of $10&nbsp;million, which was received February 2014 (which is
included in the aforementioned $180&nbsp;million if all milestones or thresholds are met) within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the database lock. On June&nbsp;25, 2014, the database for the pivotal Phase 3 efficacy study of BELBUCA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in opioid-experienced patients was locked.&nbsp;The locking of the database triggered a $10&nbsp;million milestone payment from Endo, which was received July 2014. On December&nbsp;23, 2014, we
and Endo announced the submission of a NDA for BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> to the FDA, which was accepted February&nbsp;23, 2015, which triggered a $10&nbsp;million milestone payment due from Endo to us. As
stated above, on October&nbsp;23, 2015 the FDA approved BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> for licensing in the United States, which we announced on October&nbsp;26, 2015. The FDA&#146;s approval of BELBUCA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> triggered a milestone payment to us from Endo of $50&nbsp;million, of which $20&nbsp;million has been deferred for future revenue recognition as the payment is contingently refundable in the
event a generic product is commercially launched during the patent extension period. As mentioned below, the obligations of this milestone were extinguished upon the closing of the termination agreement. This $20&nbsp;million was recognized as
revenue in January 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;8, 2016 we announced we had entered into a termination agreement with Endo (the Endo Termination

due to Endo under the Endo Termination Agreement, are payable to Endo in cash, in four quarterly installments on the last calendar day of each quarter in 2017. Furthermore, we will not be responsible for future royalties or milestone payments to
Endo, and Endo will not be obligated to any future milestone payments to us. The Termination Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and mutual releases and indemnification. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the closing of the Termination Agreement, we and Endo entered into a Transition Services Agreement which governed the post-closing rights

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">around-the-clock,</FONT></FONT> long-term opioid treatment for which alternative treatments, such as <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-opioids</FONT> or immediate release opioids, are inadequate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The pain market is well established, with many pharmaceutical companies marketing new formulations of existing products as well as generic
versions of older, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-patent</FONT> protected products. In 2017, according to data from Symphony Health, the market for extended release opioids in the U.S. totaled nearly $4.5&nbsp;billion in annual sales with
nearly 16&nbsp;million prescriptions dispensed. However, prescription sales of long acting opioids declined by 10% in 2017 compared to 2016 amidst wide-ranging efforts to curb misuse, abuse and over use of opioids in order to address the current
opioid crisis. In March 2017, the President Trump signed an executive order establishing the President&#146;s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and in October declared the opioid crisis a national emergency. While
governmental and other efforts continue to focus on combating the current opioid epidemic, we remain committed to focusing on responsible opioid prescribing and believe that products such as BELBUCA and BUNAVAIL can help play an important role in
addressing the current healthcare crisis in the U.S. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A number of products are competitors to BELBUCA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. One area of focus for us (and previously for Endo) is to position BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in patients who are transitioning from short to long acting
opioids. Indications for such use include pain associated with lower back and severe arthritis conditions where alternative treatment options have been inadequate, and pain is severe enough to require daily, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">around-the-clock,</FONT></FONT> long-term opioid treatment. Marketed competitors for these indications include Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (buprenorphine transdermal patch) from Purdue
and Schedule II opioids such as OxyContin<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> from Purdue and Nucynta<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> ER from Depomed/Collegium. Other competition includes multiple
generic Schedule II oral opioid formulations, such as morphine, hydrocodone, and fentanyl containing products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, &#147;abuse

STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, use a variety of technologies that aim to minimize the potential for abuse and misuse. Abuse deterrent products are likely to play an unclear but increasingly important role in prescribing,
potentially even replacing the original product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An advantage of BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is that
the compound, buprenorphine, may be inherently less likely to cause abuse and addiction given the lower propensity for the product to cause euphoria and is the current basis of its Schedule III classification. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The first buprenorphine formulation for the treatment of chronic pain, Purdue Pharma&#146;s
Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> (buprenorphine transdermal system), was approved in 2010. Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, like
BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, is indicated for use in patients with pain severe enough to require daily, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">around-the-clock,</FONT></FONT> long-term
opioid treatment for which alternative options are inadequate. Butrans delivers buprenorphine transdermally (through the skin) over a period of seven days. The approval of Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> signaled
the interest and approvability of new formulations of buprenorphine. Butrans is available in a range of doses to treat patients on up to 80 mg MSE (morphine sulfate equivalents) compared to 180 mg MSE with BELBUCA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. It is our view that the flexibility of dosing with a BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> formulation, wider range of doses and ease of use will make it a preferred
formulation for a significant number of patients with chronic pain conditions. Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was launched in early 2011. Sales of Butrans<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
in 2017 totaled over $239&nbsp;million, a decrease of 10% over the prior year. The decrease is primarily attributed to the launch of generic buprenorphine transdermal patches in 2017, which in December 2017, accounted for <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-third</FONT> of all buprenorphine transdermal patch prescriptions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Insys Therapeutics, Inc. (or Insys) is
developing sublingual buprenorphine spray for the treatment of pain. Results of a Phase 3 trial of this product were reported in August 2016 and indicated that sublingual buprenorphine spray was well tolerated and led to reduced pain vs. placebo
over 48 hours after a bunionectomy procedure. Insys announced in December 2017 that the New Drug Application for its buprenorphine sublingual spray for
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">moderate-to-severe</FONT></FONT> acute pain had been accepted for filing by the FDA. Insys is also considering future studies in chronic pain; however, development of a product for
the treatment of chronic pain is more complex with lengthier trials and greater risk, thus sublingual buprenorphine spray for chronic pain is not viewed as a near-term threat to BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>.
While limited information is available, other formulations of buprenorphine may also be in early stages of development for the treatment of pain. Relmada Therapeutics Inc. has in its pipeline an oral, enteric-coated buprenorphine (BuTab) for chronic
pain and opioid dependence indications. In December 2015, Relmada announced topline results of a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">proof-of-concept</FONT></FONT> pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers which
showed that the product can be delivered at therapeutic levels through the gastrointestinal route, though the bioavailability remained low. No further development is noted. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition to direct competitors, there are other factors that impact the market for pain
products in general. The significant pricing pressures and availability of generic products in the U.S. and other regions are likely to have increasing influence on the pharmaceutical market, including pain products. Additionally, opioids continue
to garner increased scrutiny based on the growing problem of prescription drug abuse and addiction. It remains unclear what additional steps, if any, the FDA or other government agencies may take to address the problem of opioid abuse and addiction.
However, in July 2012 the FDA approved a class-wide REMS program for the extended release and long-acting opioids. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical
education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> falls within the existing class-wide REMS program. In August 2014, the DEA published in the Federal Register its final
ruling moving hydrocodone combination products (such as Vicodin, Lortab, Norco, etc.) from Schedule III to the more-restrictive Schedule II, as recommended by the Assistant Secretary for Health of HHS and as supported by the DEA&#146;s own
evaluation of relevant data. As a result of the ruling, hydrocodone containing products are now classified in the same category (Schedule II) as morphine and oxycodone. In addition, HHS&#146;s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (or the CDC)
in March 2016 issued guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain. CDC developed and published the<I></I><I>&nbsp;CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain</I>&nbsp;to provide recommendations for the prescribing of opioid pain
medication for patients 18 and older in primary care settings. Recommendations focus on the use of opioids in treating chronic pain. The guidelines advocate use of nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy as first line therapy
for chronic pain. When starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians are advised to prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids and to prescribe the lowest effective dosage. The availability of
the guidelines has resulted in confusion and cautiousness, particularly among primary care physicians, and a reduced willingness to treat patients for chronic pain. A sharp reduction in prescriptions among Primary Care Physicians and an increase
among Pain Specialists are evidence of the shift in prescribing and in the dynamics of pain treatment. Additionally, in June 2017, the FDA requested that Endo Pharmaceuticals remove Opana ER (oxymorphone), from the market based on concerns that the
benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks. This is the first time the agency has taken steps to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to the public health consequences of abuse. The FDA&#146;s decision was
based on a review of all available postmarketing data, which demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the product&#146;s reformulation. It is anticipated that other steps will be taken to
further limit the use, duration dose or availability of certain opioids &#150; particularly those with Schedule II designation. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In June 2014, BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was approved by the FDA for the maintenance treatment of
opioid dependence &#150; and in May 2017 we announced that the BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> indication was expanded to include induction of buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence. BUNAVAIL<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> contains the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine, which binds to the same receptors as opiate drugs but has a higher affinity. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is included as an abuse deterrent.
When used as directed, the naloxone is swallowed and minimally absorbed; however, if misused (i.e., dissolved and injected), the naloxone rapidly precipitates withdrawal symptoms. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Treatment with buprenorphine reduces the typical cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with coming off opioid prescription painkillers
and heroin. This allows the individual suffering from an addiction to opioids &#150;along with counseling and support &#150; to work toward recovery. On average, treatment lasts a couple months, reflecting relatively high dropout rates, but a
significant number of people remain on buprenorphine treatment chronically, with nearly <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-quarter</FONT> of patients still on therapy after nine months.
BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> provides an alternative treatment utilizing the advanced BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> drug delivery technology. BUNAVAIL<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> provides the highest bioavailability of any buprenorphine-containing product for opioid dependence, allowing for effective treatment with half the dose compared to Suboxone<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> film. Additionally, BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> offers convenient and discrete buccal administration and avoids the need for patients to avoid talking and
swallowing during administration. Data has also demonstrated an excellent tolerability profile with a 68% reduction at the end of 12 weeks in the incidence of constipation in a Phase 3 trial in patients converted from Suboxone<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> sublingual tablets or film to BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The total U.S. market for buprenorphine containing products for opioid dependence exceeded $25&nbsp;billion in 2017, an increase of 14% over
2016. The market has grown steadily as a result of the rapidly escalating problem of prescription opioid misuse and abuse, a recent resurgence of heroin use, the growing number of physicians treating opioid dependence, and the inclusion of addiction
treatment as an essential benefit in the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, important steps were taken by government agencies in 2015 to expand access to medication assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. In August 2016,
based on a new ruling from HHS, the cap on the number of patients eligible to be treated by waivered physicians increased from a maximum of 100 to 275. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), over 3,900
clinicians applied for and were granted waivers to prescribe buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence at the increased limit by early 2018 with a total of over 46,000 waivered practitioners in total. Subsequently, The Comprehensive
Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) was signed into law.&nbsp;This was the first major federal addiction legislation in 40 years, and&nbsp;the most comprehensive effort undertaken to address the opioid epidemic. The legislation included expansion of
office-based treatment by allowing Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid dependence beginning in 2018. </P>

limited to date, with generic buprenorphine/naloxone tablets accounting for only 23% of total buprenorphine/naloxone product prescriptions. Additional generics may enter the market, though the timing is unclear and the impact is anticipated to be

Abstral<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> that delivers fentanyl for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. Zubsolv<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is being marketed predominantly based on its
claims of improved taste and faster dissolve time compared to Suboxone<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. Sales for Zubsolv<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in 2017 were relatively flat and totaled

cancer. Cancer patients often suffer from a variety of symptoms including pain as a result of their cancer or cancer treatment. Pain is a widely prevalent symptom in cancer patients, and an estimated 50% to 90% of those with cancer also suffer from
what is referred to as breakthrough cancer pain (or BTCP). Following rapid onset that peaks in three to five minutes, BTCP episodes can last several minutes to an hour, and usually occur several times per day. BTCP can be difficult to treat due to
its severity, rapid onset and the often unpredictable nature. Physicians typically treat BTCP with a variety of short-acting opioid medications, including morphine and fentanyl. A number of formulations of fentanyl are available employing a variety
of drug delivery technologies, all which provide rapid onset and relatively short duration of action to address the fast onset and short duration of BTCP. </P>

strategy, we believe that our technology may be differentiated because unlike these potential competitors, ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> has a predefined residence time on the buccal membrane providing for
consistent drug delivery from dose to dose. We believe that the competitive formulations of fentanyl will have intra-dose variability, meaning the patient may not get the same response each time the product is administered. In addition, it is our

challenges remain regarding patient adherence to long-term buprenorphine treatment, which is critical to successfully managing opioid dependence. This has led to interest in alternative delivery systems for buprenorphine. One such opportunity is the
development of an injectable, long-acting formulation. Microsphere-based, long acting, buprenorphine extended release injection has the ability to change the treatment paradigm in opioid dependence and pain management. Such a dosage form provides
improved therapy compliance through continuous delivery of drug for up to 30 days.&nbsp;In 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Evonik to develop and commercialize a proprietary, injectable microparticle formulation of buprenorphine
potentially capable of providing 30 days of continuous therapy following a single subcutaneous injection. While we plan to pursue an indication for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, we have also secured the rights and are developing a
product for the treatment of chronic pain in patients requiring continuous opioid therapy. Significant progress has been made in the development of a formulation to allow for delivery once per month as well as provide advantages over other
injectable buprenorphine products. We submitted an IND for Buprenorphine Extended Release Injection in December 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In terms of

license agreement with Braeburn Pharmaceuticals. The license granted Braeburn exclusive commercialization rights in the United States and Canada. While limited information is available on current use of Probuphine, given the need for surgical
implantation and removal as well as dosing limitations, we do not expect Probuphine to be a significant competitor to our buprenorphine injection. </P>

patients were randomized to one of two Sublocade regimens or placebo. Both dosage regimens of Sublocade were shown to be superior to placebo in achieving more illicit opioid-free weeks. Sublocade
is expected to be made available in the first quarter of 2018 in single dose, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-filled</FONT> syringes (100 mg, 300 mg) and will require refrigeration. The product is intended to be administered only by a

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">However, patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical organizations are uncertain and involve complex legal and technical issues.
There is considerable uncertainty regarding the breadth of claims in patent cases which results in varied degrees of protection. While we believe that our intellectual property position is sound, it may be that our pending patent applications will
not be granted or that our awarded claims may be too narrow to protect the products against competitors. It is also possible that our intellectual property positions will be challenged or that patents issued to others prior to our patent issuance
may preclude us from commercializing our products. It is also possible that other parties could have or could obtain patent rights which may cover or block our products or otherwise dominate our patent position. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This potential exists in our present litigation with Aquestive. Aquestive claimed in a litigation initiated in late 2010 that our confidential

that the original claims in Aquestive patents &#145;588, &#145;292 and &#145;891 are invalid or overbroad, and, in connection with inter partes and ex parte reexamination proceedings we have brought before the USPTO, the USPTO has either rejected
and cancelled all claims, amended the original claims to make them narrower, or issued narrower, new claims replacing the broader original claims for each of the &#145;588, &#145;292 and US patent No 7,357,891 (which we refer to as the &#146;891
Patent), respectively. We also believe that the manufacturing processes for our products, including BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> do not
infringe Aquestive&#146;s patents, at least because they do not meet the limitations of the original, amended or new claims of Aquestive&#146;s patents. We maintain our manufacturing processes for our
BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> products and product candidates as trade secrets. Based on our examination of these patents, we do not believe our manufacturing processes infringe Aquestive&#146;s patents. On
March&nbsp;7, 2012, the court granted our motion to stay the case pending outcome of the reexamination proceedings in the USPTO. On July&nbsp;3, 2012, the USPTO issued an ex parte reexamination certificate on the &#145;891 patent, in which all
original claims were amended to make them narrower. On August&nbsp;26, 2012, the USPTO issued an ex parte reexamination certificate on the United States Patent No 7,425,292 (which we refer to as the &#146;292 Patent), in which all the original
broader claims were replaced with narrower, new claims. As for the United States Patent No.&nbsp;7,824,588) (which we refer to as the &#146;588 Patent), after the reexamination proceedings (and its appeals process), on April&nbsp;17, 2014, the
Patent Trial and Appeal Board (&#147;PTAB&#148;) of the USPTO issued a Decision on Appeal affirming the Examiner&#146;s rejection (and confirming the invalidity) of all the claims of the &#146;588 Patent. Aquestive did not request a rehearing by the
May&nbsp;17, 2014 due date for making such a request and did not further appeal the Decision to the Federal Court of Appeals by the June&nbsp;17, 2014 due date for making such an appeal. Subsequently, on August&nbsp;5, 2014, the USPTO issued a
Certificate of Reexamination cancelling the &#145;588 Patent claims. The litigation resumed and on September&nbsp;25, 2015 the court granted our motion of Summary Judgement of Intervening Rights and dismissed the case. Aquestive filed an appeal with
the Federal Circuit and has subsequently decided to withdraw the appeal.&nbsp;On February&nbsp;25, 2016, Aquestive filed an Unopposed Motion For Voluntary Dismissal Of Appeal, which was granted by the court on February&nbsp;26, 2016 and the case
dismissed.&nbsp;Thus, the district court&#146;s grant of the Summary Judgement of Intervening Rights will stand. </P>

greater flexibility to accommodate future strategic options. Using our own sales force provides us with significantly more control over commercialization efforts and makes us capable of selling our own products in specialty pharmaceutical markets

market access for BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. More than half of all long-acting opioid prescriptions are through commercial payers. As of January 2018,
BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is covered in formulary platforms that represent more than 85% of commercial lives.&nbsp;Approval rates within the commercial channel remain favorable at about 80%. This improved
formulary position has also had a positive impact on reversal rates which declined to approximately 6.5% in 2017 as patient cost shares improved. Although we continue to see favorable approval rates for BELBUCA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> within the Medicare space, we continue to pursue improved access to make BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> more accessible to the senior population suffering with

regions across the U.S. A key goal of these programs is to position BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> as an alternative to Schedule II opioids for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain that is not
adequately controlled with commonly prescribed first-line therapies (e.g. short acting opioids). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Canada </I></P>

commercialization options for BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, we identified BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> as an attractive product to build a commercial presence capable of
supporting both BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and our other future products. Additionally, the self-commercialization of BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> supported our
longer-term vision to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company. The dynamics of the opioid dependence market made self-commercialization a feasible and attractive option. In total, approximately 90% of all prescriptions are written by
approximately 5,000 physicians &#150; which include primary care physicians, psychiatrists, addiction medicine specialists and pain specialists, with most concentrated in the eastern third of the U.S. and the west coast, allowing for coverage of a
majority of the prescriber base with a modest sized sales force. Additionally, the relatively small prescriber base along with the limited number of competitors results in relatively modest marketing expenditures. And finally, the high awareness and
physician acceptance of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence lessens the need for costly educational and promotional programs. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;3, 2014, we announced the availability of BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in the U.S.

products for the treatment of opioid dependence. The launch was also supported by a full marketing effort aimed at increasing product awareness including advertising and promotion, direct mail and email, a speakers&#146; program and a number of
initiatives, including a copay support program, to minimize access issues. Our managed care efforts continued to progress as we executed six new managed care contracts between July and November 2016 which were beneficial to our sales efforts in
2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In August 2015, we announced the appointment of Scott M. Plesha as Senior Vice President of Sales. Mr.&nbsp;Plesha joined us with

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The results of the pharmaceutical and manufacturing development work, nonclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA in the
form of an NDA for approval to market and sell the product. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort. In addition to the results of nonclinical and clinical testing, the NDA applicant must submit detailed
information about chemistry, manufacturing and controls that will describe how the product is made, packaged, labeled, and tested through the manufacturing process. The manufacturing process continues to develop throughout the period of clinical
trials such that, at the time of the NDA, it has been demonstrated that there is control of the process and the product can be made consistently at commercial scale. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The NDA review process involves FDA investigation into the details of the manufacturing process, as well as the design and analysis of each of
the nonclinical and clinical studies. This review includes inspection of the manufacturing facility, the data recording process for the clinical studies, the record keeping at a sample of clinical trial sites and a thorough review of the results for
each nonclinical and clinical study. Through this review, the FDA reaches a decision about the risk-benefit profile of a product candidate. If the benefit outweighs the risk, the FDA begins negotiation with the company on the content of an
acceptable package insert and an associated REMS plan if required. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The NDA review process is affected by many factors, including the
severity of the disease, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Consequently, there is a risk that approval may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny approval
of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed, require additional testing or
information, or require post-marketing testing (Phase 4) and surveillance to monitor the safety of a company&#146;s product if it does not believe the NDA contains adequate evidence of its safety. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if
compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or health problems are identified that would alter the risk-benefit analysis for the product. Post-approval studies may be conducted to explore the use of the product for new indications or
populations such as pediatrics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Among the conditions for NDA approval is the requirement that any prospective manufacturer&#146;s quality
control and manufacturing procedures conform to Good Manufacturing Practices and the specifications approved in the NDA. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the
area of quality control and quality assurance to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, also are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other federal, state or local
agencies. Additionally, in the event of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliance,</FONT> the FDA may issue warning letters and/or seek criminal and civil penalties, enjoin manufacture, seize product or revoke approval. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2008, new legislation designated as the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (the FDAAA) took effect. This legislation
strengthened the FDA&#146;s authority over drug safety and directs the FDA to develop systems aimed at managing the risk-benefit ratio of a drug, with a particular focus on post-approval safety. FDAAA authorized the FDA to require and enforce a Risk
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the potential risks. The legislation also provides the FDA with increased authority to require REMS at any point
in a drug product&#146;s lifecycle based on new safety information. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A REMS is defined by the FDA as a strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated
with a drug or biological product. The FDA&#146;s assessment of whether to require a REMS as a condition for approval considers factors such as the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition that is to
be treated by the drug, the expected benefit, and the seriousness of any known or potential adverse events that may be related to the drug. A REMS may be conveyed through the use of a number of tools including a Medication Guide for distribution
when the drug is dispensed, a communication plan to physicians to convey potential risks, and elements to ensure safe use. These elements may include provisions that healthcare providers who prescribe the drug and pharmacists who dispense the drug
have particular training, experience or special certifications; that the drug be dispensed only in certain healthcare settings; that the drug be dispensed to patients with evidence of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">safe-use</FONT> conditions;
and/or that patients must be enrolled in a registry. Under the FDAAA, the FDA has also been granted enforcement authority over violations of the REMS provisions. The FDA may impose civil monetary penalties, the drug or biological product can be
deemed misbranded, and/or the FDA may obtain injunctive relief against further distribution of the product. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;29, 2011,
the FDA approved a &#147;class-wide&#148; REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products under a single risk management program. ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is subject to this REMS. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additionally, FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering the extended release and long acting opioid drug products. The class-wide REMS
program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is
subject to this existing class-wide REMS program. The cost and implementation of the extended release and long-acting opioid REMS is shared among multiple companies in the category. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">There also continues to be a REMS in place for buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence. BUNAVAIL<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is included in this existing REMS that is far less cumbersome than the ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> REMS and includes a medication guide and healthcare

the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than
that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general, each country at this time has its own procedures and requirements. </P>

optimize the commercial potential of BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, we must execute upon our commercialization plan effectively and
efficiently. In addition, we must continually assess and modify our commercialization plan to adapt to the promotional response. Further, we must continue to focus and refine our marketing campaign to ensure a clear and understandable
physician-patient dialogue around BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> as an appropriate therapy. In addition, we must provide our sales force with
the highest quality training, support, guidance and oversight for them to effectively promote BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. If we fail to
perform these commercial functions in the highest quality manner, BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> will not achieve its maximum commercial
potential or any level of success at all.&nbsp;In addition, sales and marketing efforts could be negatively impacted by the delay or failure to obtain additional supportive clinical trial data for our products. The deterioration or loss of our sales
force would materially and adversely impact our ability to generate sales revenue, which would hurt our results of operations.&nbsp;Finally, we are competing and expect to compete with other companies that currently have extensive and well-funded

funded almost entirely by external financing and not from commercial revenues. Such financing has historically come primarily from license and royalty fees, traditional secured loans, the sale of common and preferred stock and convertible debt to
third parties, related party loans and, to a lesser degree, from grants. At December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had cash of approximately $21.2&nbsp;million. Since revenue from BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BUNAVAIL<SUP

on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our operations and planned growth, develop or enhance our technologies, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive market pressures. Any negative impact on our operations may make
raising additional capital more difficult or impossible and may also result in a lower price for our shares. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>We may have difficulty

the market for our product candidates. In February 2016, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid abuse epidemic and reassess the FDA&#146;s approach to opioid medications. The plan identifies FDA&#146;s focus on implementing policies
to reverse the opioid abuse epidemic, while maintaining access to effective treatments. The actions set forth in the FDA&#146;s plan include strengthening post marketing study requirements to evaluate the benefit of long-term opioid use, changing
the REMS requirements to provide additional funding for physician education courses, releasing a draft guidance setting forth approval standards for generic-abuse deterrent opioid formulations, and seeking input from the FDA&#146;s Scientific Board
to broaden the understanding of the public risks of opioid abuse. The FDA&#146;s Scientific Advisory Board met to address these issues on March&nbsp;1, 2016. The FDA&#146;s plan is part of a broader initiative led by the HHS to address
opioid-related overdose, death and dependence. The HHS initiative&#146;s focus is on improving physician&#146;s use of opioids through education and resources to address opioid over-prescribing, increasing use and development of improved delivery
systems for naloxone, which can reverse overdose from both prescription opioids and heroin, to reduce overdose-related deaths, and expanding the use of Medication-Assisted Treatment, which couples counseling and behavioral therapies with medication
to address substance abuse. Also, as part of this initiative, the CDC has launched a state grant program to offer state health departments resources to assist with abuse prevention efforts, including efforts to track opioid prescribing through <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">state-run</FONT> electronic databases. In March 2016, as part of the HHS initiative, the CDC released a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The guideline is intended to assist primary care providers
treating adults for chronic pain in outpatient settings.&nbsp;The guideline provides recommendations to improve communications between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of opioid therapy for chronic pain, improve the safety and
effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce the risks associated with long-term opioid therapy. The guideline does not specifically address the use of buprenorphine for chronic pain or make treatment recommendations about the use of abuse-deterrent
opioids. Many of these changes and others could cause us to expend additional resources in developing and commercializing BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and our product candidates to meet additional requirements.

an additional $5&nbsp;million; umbrella&nbsp;liability is $5&nbsp;million aggregate and $5 million&nbsp;per occurrence. It is possible that this coverage will be insufficient to protect us from future claims. Under our agreements, our partners are

Furthermore, our current and potential partners with whom we have collaborative agreements or our future licensees may not be willing to indemnify us against these types of liabilities and may not themselves be sufficiently insured or have

December&nbsp;29, 2011, FDA approved a REMS program covering all transmucosal fentanyl products. The program, which is referred to as the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS Access Program, was designed to ensure informed
risk-benefit decisions before initiating treatment with a transmucosal fentanyl product, and while patients are on treatment, to ensure appropriate use. The approved program covers all approved transmucosal fentanyl products under a single program
and was implemented in March 2012. Additionally, the FDA has implemented a class-wide REMS covering the extended release and long acting opioid class. The class-wide REMS program consists of a REMS-compliant educational program offered by an
accredited provider of continuing medical education, patient counseling materials and a medication guide. BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> falls within the existing class-wide REMS program. The cost and

clinical trials that are necessary to obtain approval by the FDA to market a drug product, the FDA requires the submission of an IND. The FDA has 30 days to review the IND and, unless the FDA raises an issue or concern about the clinical trial plan
during that time period, the IND becomes effective at the end of that 30 days and sponsors may proceed with their clinical trial plans. The FDA can suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time due to a number of factors, including for safety or

planned clinical trials or the trials are suspended or permanently terminated by us, the FDA or any institutional review boards overseeing the trials, the commercial prospects of our product
candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may
also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, it is our stated intention to seek to
avail ourselves of the FDA&#146;s 505(b)(2) approval procedure where it is appropriate to do so. Section&nbsp;505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act permits an applicant to file a NDA where at least some of the information required
for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and the FDA&#146;s findings of safety and effectiveness based
on certain preclinical testing or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. If this approval pathway is not
available to us with respect to a particular formulation or product, or at all, the time and cost associated with developing and commercializing such formulations or products may be prohibitive and our business strategy would be materially and
adversely affected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Moreover, we may be required to conduct additional costly and time-consuming clinical studies beyond those that we
originally anticipate in the event that our clinical trials fail to meet their primary endpoints or for other reasons, which would render them inadequate to support approval by the FDA. For example, in September 2011, we announced that our Phase 3
clinical trial for BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> did not meet its primary endpoint and therefore we were required to conduct new and costly trials under our license and development agreement with Endo prior to NDA
approval. Additionally, in December&nbsp;2016, we announced that our Phase 2b clinical study assessing the efficacy and safety of Clonidine Topical Gel failed to show a statistically significant difference in pain relief between Clonidine Topical
Gel and placebo. As a result, we discontinued further development of the product. If our trials fail to meet their endpoints and we elect to move forward with clinical development, conducting new clinical trials in accordance with the FDA
requirements and with designs that seek to remedy any prior trial deficiencies will require significant additional capital with no assurances of positive outcomes, and will not able to commercialize and sell our any applicable product until we were
able to meet our primary endpoints, of which no assurances can be given. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to
varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. </I></B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Data already obtained, or data we may obtain
in the future, from <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-clinical</FONT> studies and clinical trials do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-clinical</FONT> studies and clinical
trials. Moreover, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-clinical</FONT> and clinical data are susceptible to multiple and varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical
industry, including those involved in competing drug delivery technologies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and
effectiveness of a proposed formulation or product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the product candidate, resulting in delays to commercialization, and could materially harm our business. In addition, our clinical
trials may not demonstrate sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our drugs, and thus our proposed drugs may not be approved for marketing. Finally, if any of our clinical trials do not
meet their primary endpoints, or for a variety of other reasons, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials in order to progress development of the subject product. These additional trials would be costly and time-consuming and would
divert resources from other projects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing risks were evidenced by the failure of our Phase 3 trial for BELBUCA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain to meet its primary endpoint, which we announced September 2011. These risks were further evidenced in that, on March&nbsp;30, 2015, we
announced that the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 3 clinical study of Clonidine Topical Gel compared to placebo for the treatment of PDN did not meet statistical significance, although certain secondary endpoints showed statistically
significant improvement over placebo. Final analysis of the study identified a sizeable patient population with a statistically significant improvement (n=158; p&lt;0.02) in pain score vs placebo. Following thorough analysis of the data and
identification of the reasons behind the study results, we initiated a second study. The study incorporates significant learnings from previously conducted studies and involves tightened and additional inclusion criteria to improve assay
sensitivity, reduce bias and ensure compliance with enrollment criteria. In December&nbsp;2016, we announced that our Phase 2b clinical study assessing the efficacy and safety of Clonidine Topical Gel failed to show a statistically significant
difference in pain relief between Clonidine Topical Gel and placebo. As a result, we are discontinuing further development of the product and have returned the rights to Arcion. </P>

foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. In the United States, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, the U.S.
Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory
proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of such proposals and related laws, rules and regulations could materially harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations or stock price. Moreover, the passage of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, and efforts to amend or repeal such law, has created significant uncertainty relating to the scope of government regulation of healthcare and related legal and regulatory requirements, which could have an
adverse impact on sales of our products. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The ability of our company to commercialize

private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Consumers and third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drugs and medical services. Also, the trend toward managed health care in the United States, which

marketing and sale of our proposed drug formulations involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us. All of our clinical trials have been, and all of our proposed clinical trials are anticipated to be conducted by
collaborators and third-party contractors. We currently have a general liability/product liability policy which includes coverage for our clinical trials and our commercially marketed products. Annual aggregate limits include $2&nbsp;million for
general liability, with $1&nbsp;million for each occurrence; product liability is $15&nbsp;million for aggregate and $15&nbsp;million per occurrence with excess liability in the amount of an additional $5&nbsp;million; umbrella&nbsp;liability is
$5&nbsp;million aggregate and $5 million&nbsp;per occurrence. It is possible that this coverage will be insufficient to protect us from future claims. Under our agreement, Meda is required to carry comprehensive general product liability and tort
liability insurance, each in amounts not less than $5&nbsp;million per incident and $10&nbsp;million annual aggregate and to name us as an additional insured thereon. </P>

unavailable to us, or if it can be obtained at such time, that it will be available at an unaffordable cost. Even if we obtain insurance, it may prove inadequate to cover claims and/or litigation costs, especially in the case of wrongful death
claims. Product liability claims or other claims related to our products, regardless of their outcome, could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant settlement amounts or judgments. Any successful product
liability or other claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect
against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products and product candidates. A product liability claim could also significantly harm our reputation and delay market acceptance of our proposed
formulations and products. In addition, although third party partners are required to provide insurance in connection with specific products such partners may face similar insurance related risks. </P>

newly approved healthcare products. The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. In the United States, the&nbsp;Patient Protection&nbsp;and&nbsp;Affordable Care
Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (&#147;ACA&#148;), is significantly changing the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. While we cannot predict what impact on
federal reimbursement policies this law or any amendment to it will continue to have in general or specifically on any product that we commercialize, the ACA or any such amendment may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement,
which could negatively affect market acceptance of new products. In addition, although the United States Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA, several states have not implemented certain sections of the ACA, including 19
that have rejected the expansion of Medicaid eligibility for low income citizens, and some members of the U.S. Congress are still working to repeal the ACA. More recently, President Trump and the Republican majorities in both houses of the U.S.
Congress have been seeking to repeal or replace all or portions of the ACA but to date they have been unable to agree on any such legislation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment
imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the &#147;individual mandate&#148;. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a
continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the ACA, including the so-called &#147;Cadillac&#148;&nbsp;tax on certain high cost employer- sponsored insurance plans, the
annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective
January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the
&#147;donut hole&#148;. Congress may still consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA. We expect that the ACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended or repealed in the future, and other healthcare reform measures
that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may
arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we or our collaborators are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or
our collaborators are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our products may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business. </P>

delisting proceedings and comments by NASDAQ in the past, and during 2011 our stock price declined to levels that put us at risk of not being able to maintain the required minimum bid price or market capitalization levels or both. If we are unable
to satisfy the NASDAQ criteria for continued listing, especially at our current stock price levels, our securities could again be subject to delisting. Trading, if any, of our securities would thereafter be conducted in the <FONT

with the flexibility to issue more shares in the future, which might cause dilution to our stockholders. In addition, the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include shares reserved in anticipation of the

increments, or &#147;tick sizes&#148;, for certain securities with small market capitalization. Specifically, subject to certain exceptions, the minimum quotation price and minimum trading price for securities in Test Group 3, like the common stock,
have been widened to $0.05 per share, which means that the common stock must now be quoted in $0.05 minimum increments and must now trade at $0.05 minimum increments. In addition, securities in Test Group 3 are subject to a <FONT

January&nbsp;19, 2011. Aquestive claimed that our manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which has never been disclosed publicly and which we and our partners maintain as a trade secret,
infringes on its&#146;588 Patent. Of note, the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology itself was not at issue in the case, nor is BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> or BUNAVAIL<SUP

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We strongly refuted as without merit Aquestive&#146;s assertion of patent infringement, which
relates to our confidential, proprietary manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. On September&nbsp;12, 2011, we filed a request for <I>inter partes</I> reexamination in the United States Patent
and Trademark Office (USPTO) of Aquestive&#146;s &#146;588 Patent demonstrating that all claims of such patent were anticipated by or obvious in the light of prior art references, including several prior art references not previously considered by
the USPTO, and thus invalid. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, we filed a motion for stay pending the outcome of the reexamination proceedings, which subsequently was granted. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November&nbsp;2011, the USPTO rejected all 191 claims of Aquestive&#146;s &#146;588 Patent. On January&nbsp;20, 2012, we filed requests for
reexamination before the USPTO of Aquestive&#146;s &#146;891 Patent, and&#146;292 Patent, the two additional patents asserted by Aquestive, demonstrating that all claims of those two patents were anticipated by or obvious in the light of prior art
references, including prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and thus invalid. The USPTO granted the requests for reexamination with respect to Aquestive&#146;s &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents. In its initial office action in
each, the USPTO rejected every claim in each patent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As expected, in the &#146;891 Patent and &#146;292 Patent Ex Parte Reexamination
proceedings, Aquestive amended the claims several times and made multiple declarations and arguments in an attempt to overcome the rejections made by the USPTO. These amendments, declarations and other statements regarding the claim language
significantly narrowed the scope of their claims in these two patents. In the case of the &#146;891 Patent, not one of the original claims survived reexamination and five separate amendments were filed confirming our position that the patent was
invalid. Additionally, we believe that arguments and admissions made by Aquestive prevent it from seeking a broader construction during any subsequent litigation by employing arguments or taking positions that contradict those made during
prosecution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A Reexamination Certificate for Aquestive&#146;s &#146;891 Patent in its amended form was issued August&nbsp;21, 2012
(Reexamined Patent No.&nbsp;7,357,891C1 or the &#147;&#146;891C1 Patent&#148;). A Reexamination Certificate for Aquestive&#146;s &#146;292 Patent in its amended form was issued on July&nbsp;3, 2012 (Reexamined Patent No.&nbsp;7,425,292C1 or the
&#147;&#146;292C1 Patent&#148;). These actions by the USPTO confirm the invalidity of the original patents and through the narrowing of the claims in the reissued patents strengthens our original assertion that our products and technologies do not
infringe on Aquestive&#146;s original patents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;12, 2013, despite our previously noted success in the prior ex parte
reexaminations for the &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents, we filed requests for <I>inter partes </I>reviews (&#147;IPRs&#148;) on the narrowed yet reexamined patents, the &#146;292 C1 and &#146;891 C1 Patents, to challenge their validity and continue
to strengthen our position. On November&nbsp;13, 2013, the USPTO decided not to institute the two IPRs for the &#146;891 C1 and &#146;292 C1 Patents. The USPTO&#146;s decision was purely on statutory grounds and based on a technicality (in that the
IPRs were not filed within what the UPSTO determined to be the statutory period) rather than substantive grounds. Thus, even though the IPRs were not instituted, the USPTO decision preserves our right to raise the same arguments at a later time
(e.g., during litigation). Regardless, our assertion that our products and technologies do not infringe the original &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents and, now, the reexamined &#146;891 C1 and &#146;292 C1 Patents remains the same. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Importantly, in the case of Aquestive&#146;s &#146;588 Patent, at the conclusion of the reexamination proceedings (and its appeals process),
on April&nbsp;17, 2014, the PTAB issued a Decision on Appeal affirming the Examiner&#146;s rejection (and confirming the invalidity) of all the claims of the &#146;588 Patent. Aquestive did not request a rehearing by the May&nbsp;17, 2014 due date
for making such a request and did not further appeal the Decision to the Federal Court of Appeals by the June&nbsp;17, 2014 due date for making such an appeal. Subsequently, on August&nbsp;5, 2014, the USPTO issued a Certificate of Reexamination
cancelling the &#145;588 Patent claims. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on our original assertion that our proprietary manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> does not infringe on patents held by Aquestive, and the denial and subsequent narrowing of the claims on the two reissued patents Aquestive has asserted against us while the third has had all
claims rejected by the USPTO, we remain confident in our original stated position regarding this matter. Thus far, we have proven that the &#147;original&#148; &#146;292 and &#146;891 patents in light of their reissuance with fewer and narrower
claims were indeed invalid and the third and final patent, the &#146;588 patent, was invalid as well with all its claims cancelled. Given the outcomes of the &#145;292, &#145;891 and &#145;588 reexamination proceedings, at a January&nbsp;22, 2015
status meeting, the Court decided to lift the stay and grant our request for the case to proceed on an expedited basis with a Motion for Summary Judgment to dismiss the action. On September&nbsp;25, 2015, our motion for summary judgment was ordered
and the case was subsequently closed. We were found to be entitled to absolute intervening rights as to both patents in suit, the &#145;292 and &#145;891 patents and our ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product is
not liable for infringing the patents prior to July&nbsp;3, 2012 and August&nbsp;21, 2012, respectively. In October 2015, Aquestive appealed the decision of the court to the Federal Circuit. We had no reason to believe the outcome would be different
and were prepared to vigorously defend the appeal. Aquestive, however, subsequently decided to withdraw the appeal.&nbsp;On February&nbsp;25, 2016, Aquestive filed an Unopposed Motion For Voluntary Dismissal Of Appeal, which was granted by the court
on February&nbsp;26, 2016 and the case dismissed.&nbsp;Thus, the district court&#146;s grant of the Summary Judgement of Intervening Rights stands. The possibility exists that Aquestive could file another suit alleging infringement of the &#145;292
and &#146;891 patents. We continue to believe, however, that ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and our other products relying on the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology, including
BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, do not infringe any amended, reexamined claim from either patent. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On October&nbsp;29, 2013, Reckitt Benckiser, Inc., RB Pharmaceuticals Limited, and Aquestive (collectively, the RB Plaintiffs) filed an action
against us relating to our BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina for alleged patent infringement. BUNAVAIL<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is a drug approved for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. The RB Plaintiffs claim that the formulation for BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which
has never been disclosed publicly, infringes its patent (United States Patent No.&nbsp;8,475,832) (the &#147;&#146;832 Patent&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On
May&nbsp;21, 2014, the Court granted our motion to dismiss. In doing so, the Court dismissed the case in its entirety. The RB Plaintiffs did not appeal the Court Decision by the June&nbsp;21, 2014 due date and therefore, the dismissal will stand and
the RB Plaintiffs lose the ability to challenge the Court Decision in the future. The possibility exists, however, that the RB Plaintiffs could file another suit alleging infringement of the &#145;832 Patent. If this occurs, based on our original
position that our BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product does not infringe the &#145;832 Patent, we would defend the case vigorously (as we have done so previously), and we anticipate that such claims against us
ultimately would be rejected. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;20, 2014, based upon our position and belief that our BUNAVAIL<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product does not infringe any patents owned by the RB Plaintiffs, we proactively filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North (EDNC)
Carolina, requesting the Court to make a determination that our BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product does not infringe the RB Plaintiffs&#146; &#145;832 Patent, US Patent No.&nbsp;7,897,080 (the &#147;&#145;080
Patent&#148;) and US Patent No.&nbsp;8,652,378 (the &#147;&#145;378 Patent&#148;). With the declaratory judgment, there is an automatic stay in proceedings. The RB Plaintiffs may request that the stay be lifted, but they have the burden of showing
that the stay should be lifted. For the &#145;832 Patent, the January&nbsp;15, 2014 IPR was instituted and in June 2015, all challenged claims were rejected for both anticipation and obviousness. In August 2015, the RB Plaintiffs filed an appeal to
the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit affirmed the USPTO&#146;s decision, and the RB Plaintiffs then filed a Petition for Panel Rehearing and for Rehearing En Banc, which was denied.&nbsp;A mandate issued on October&nbsp;25, 2016, pursuant to
Rule 41(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, meaning that a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court is no longer possible for the RB Plaintiffs. The &#145;832 IPR was finally resolved with the invalidation of claims <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">15-19.</FONT> For the &#145;080 Patent, all claims have been rejected in an <I>inter partes</I> reexamination and the rejection of all claims as invalid over the prior art has been affirmed on appeal by the PTAB in a
decision dated March&nbsp;27, 2015. In May 2015, the RB Plaintiffs filed a response after the decision to which we filed comments. In December 2015, the PTAB denied Aquestive&#146;s request to reopen prosecution, but provided Aquestive an
opportunity to file a corrected response. Aquestive filed the request in December 2015 and we subsequently filed comments on December&nbsp;23, 2015. The PTAB issued a communication on July&nbsp;7, 2016 denying Aquestive&#146;s request to reopen
prosecution of the rejections of all claims over the prior art.&nbsp;On January&nbsp;31, 2017, the PTAB issued a final decision maintaining an additional new ground of rejection in addition to the previous grounds of invalidity. As such, all claims
remain finally rejected on multiple grounds. If a request for rehearing is not filed within 30 days, the decision will become final as to the PTAB. Thereafter, if Aquestive does not appeal to the Federal Circuit, the decision will be final and all
claims will be cancelled. For the &#145;378 Patent, an IPR was filed on June&nbsp;1, 2014, but an IPR was not instituted. However, in issuing its November&nbsp;5, 2014 decision not to institute the IPR, the PTAB construed the claims of the &#145;378
Patent narrowly. As in prior litigation proceedings, we believe these IPR and the reexamination filings will provide support for maintaining the stay until the IPR and reexamination proceedings conclude. Indeed, given the PTAB&#146;s narrow
construction of the claims of the &#145;378 Patent, we filed a motion to withdraw the &#145;378 Patent from the case on December&nbsp;12, 2014. In addition, we also filed a joint motion to continue the stay (with RB Plaintiffs) in the proceedings on
the same day. Both the motion to withdraw the &#145;378 Patent from the proceedings and motion to continue the stay were granted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On
September&nbsp;22, 2014, the RB Plaintiffs filed an action against us (and our commercial partner) relating to our BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product in the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey for alleged patent infringement. The RB Plaintiffs claim that BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, whose formulation and manufacturing processes have never been disclosed publicly, infringes its patent U.S.
Patent No.&nbsp;8,765,167 (the &#147;&#145;167 Patent&#148;). As with prior actions by the RB Plaintiffs, we believe this is another anticompetitive attempt by the RB Plaintiffs to distract our efforts from commercializing BUNAVAIL<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. We strongly refute as without merit the RB Plaintiffs&#146; assertion of patent infringement and will vigorously defend the lawsuit. On December&nbsp;12, 2014, we filed a motion to transfer the
case from New Jersey to North Carolina and a motion to dismiss the case against our commercial partner. The Court issued an opinion on July&nbsp;21, 2015 granting our motion to transfer the venue to the&nbsp;Eastern District of North Carolina
(&#147;ENDC&#148;) but denying our motion to dismiss the case against our commercial partner as moot. We have also filed a Joint Motion to Stay the case in North Carolina at the end of April 2016, which was granted by the court on May&nbsp;5, 2016.
Thus, the case is now stayed until a final resolution of the &#145;167 IPRs in the USPTO. We will continue to vigorously defend this case in the EDNC. </P>

Patent demonstrating that certain claims of such patent were anticipated by or obvious in light of prior art references, including prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and thus, invalid. The USPTO instituted three of the four
IPR requests and we filed a request for rehearing for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-instituted</FONT> IPR. The final decisions finding all claims patentable were issued in March 2016 and we filed a Request for Reconsideration in the USPTO
in April 2016, which was denied in September 2016 and appealed to Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Fed. Cir.) in November 2016. The appeal is currently proceeding in the Federal Circuit with final briefing completed August&nbsp;7, 2017 and

January&nbsp;22, 2014, Aquestive filed a Petition for IPR on the &#145;019 Patent. The Petition asserted that the claims of the &#145;019 Patent are alleged to be unpatentable over certain prior art references. The IPR was instituted on
August&nbsp;6, 2014.&nbsp;An oral hearing was held in April 2015 and a decision upholding all seven claims was issued August&nbsp;5, 2015. In September 2015, Aquestive requested that the PTAB rehear the IPR. On December&nbsp;19, 2016, the PTAB
issued a final decision denying Aquestive&#146;s request for rehearing. Aquestive did not file a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit by February&nbsp;20, 2017, therefore, PTAB&#146;s decision upholding all claims of our &#145;019 patent will be
final and unappealable. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;13, 2017, Aquestive filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New

EDNC. Briefing on the motions was completed on June&nbsp;21, 2017. On July&nbsp;25, 2017, the Court administratively terminated the case pending the parties submission of a joint stipulation of transfer because the District of New Jersey was an
inappropriate venue. This case has been transferred to Delaware District Court. On October&nbsp;31, 2017 we filed motions to dismiss the complaint and, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the EDNC.&nbsp;Briefing on the motions was completed

(formerly Actavis) seeking to find invalid three Orange Book listed patents (the &#147;Patents&#148;) relating specifically to BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The Paragraph IV certification related to an
Abbreviated New Drug Application (the &#147;ANDA&#148;) filed by Teva with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) for a generic formulation of BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The Patents subject to
Teva&#146;s certification were the &#146;019 Patent, 8,147,866 (the &#147;&#146;866 Patent&#148;) and 8,703,177 (the &#147;&#146;177 Patent&#148;). Under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term
Restoration Act of 1984, as amended (the &#147;Hatch-Waxman Amendments&#148;), after receipt of a valid Paragraph IV notice, we may, and in this case did, bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court against Teva within 45&nbsp;days
from the date of receipt of the certification notice. On March&nbsp;18, 2016, we filed a complaint in Delaware against Teva, thus entitling us to receive a 30 month stay on the FDA&#146;s ability to give final approval to any proposed products that
reference BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay was expected to preempt any final approval by the FDA on Teva&#146;s ANDA until at least August of 2018. </P>

position on the &#146;177 patent due to its assertion that the backing layer for its generic product does not have a pH within the claimed range claimed in the patent.&nbsp;We asserted in our complaint that Teva infringed the &#145;177 patent either
literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believed that Teva was unlikely to prevail on its claims that the &#146;019, &#146;866,

unrelated IPR before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#147;USPTO&#148;) under which we prevailed, and all claims of the &#145;019 Patent survived. Teva&#146;s request for rehearing of the final IPR decision regarding the &#145;019

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;31, 2017, we received a notice relating to a Paragraph IV certification from Teva relating to Teva&#146;s ANDA on additional
strengths of BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. On March&nbsp;16, 2017, we brought suit against Teva and its parent company on these additional strengths within 45 days from the receipt of the notice in Delaware. As
in the original case brought by Actavis, we were again entitled to receive a 30 month stay on the FDA&#146;s ability to give final approval to any proposed products that reference the additional strengths of BUNAVAIL<SUP

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We received notices regarding Paragraph IV certifications from Teva on November&nbsp;8, 2016, November&nbsp;10, 2016, and December&nbsp;22,
2016, seeking to find invalid two Orange Book listed patents (the &#147;Patents&#148;) relating specifically to BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The Paragraph IV certifications relate to three ANDAs filed by Teva
with the FDA for a generic formulation of BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The Patents subject to Teva&#146;s certification were the &#146;019 Patent and the &#146;866 Patent. Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments,
after receipt of a valid Paragraph IV notice, we may, and in this case did, bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court against Teva USA within 45&nbsp;days from the date of receipt of the certification notice. We filed complaints in
Delaware against Teva on December&nbsp;22, 2016 and February&nbsp;3, 2017, thus we were entitled to receive a 30 month stay on the FDA&#146;s ability to give final approval to any proposed products that reference BELBUCA<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay was expected to preempt any final approval by the FDA on Teva&#146;s ANDA Nos. 209704 and 209772 until at least May of 2019 and for
Teva&#146;s ANDA No.&nbsp;209807 until at least June of 2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We asserted two different patents against Teva, the &#146;019 Patent and
the &#146;866 Patent.&nbsp;Teva did not contest infringement of the claims of the &#146;019 Patent and also did not contest infringement of the claims of the &#146;866 Patent that cover
BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in its Paragraph IV certifications. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believed that Teva was unlikely
to prevail on its claims that the &#146;019 and &#146;866 Patents are invalid, and, as we have done in the past, we vigorously defended our intellectual property. Both of the patents carry the presumption of validity, and the &#146;019 Patent has
already been the subject of an unrelated IPR before the USPTO under which we prevailed, and all claims of the &#145;019 Patent survived. Aquestive&#146;s request for rehearing of the final IPR decision regarding the &#146;019 Patent was denied by
the USPTO on December&nbsp;19, 2016. Aquestive did not file a timely appeal at the Federal Circuit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;23, 2017, the USPTO

rights in Europe for our lead product; BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> based ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, to Meda. In September 2007, we entered into a definitive License and

2015 and later approved by the FDA on October&nbsp;23, 2015 and commercially launched by Endo in February 2016. On December&nbsp;8, 2016, we announced that we had entered into a Termination Agreement with Endo terminating Endo&#146;s licensing of

of the transactions occurred on January&nbsp;6, 2017. On July&nbsp;31, 2013, we submitted the NDA for BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> to the FDA for review, and on June&nbsp;6, 2014, we announced the FDA approval

BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was launched by Endo in February 2016. On December&nbsp;7, 2016, we entered into an agreement with Endo terminating Endo&#146;s licensing of rights for BELBUCA<SUP

difference that BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> offers over the Schedule II opioids, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, etc., include less addiction and abuse potential along with a ceiling effect on

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On March&nbsp;12, 2012, we announced the postponement of the U.S. relaunch of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
following the initiation of the class-wide REMS until the product formulation could be modified to address two appearance-related issues. Such appearance-related issues involved the formation of microscopic crystals and a fading of the color in the
mucoadhesive layer, raised by the FDA during an inspection of our North American manufacturing partner for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, Aveva which is now a subsidiary of Apotex. While the appearance issues did
not affect the product&#146;s underlying integrity, safety or performance, the FDA believed that the fading of the color in particular may potentially confuse patients, necessitating a modification of the product and its specification before it can
be manufactured and distributed. The source of microcrystal formation and the potential for fading of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> was found to be specific to a buffer used in its formulation. We modified the
formulation and submitted a prior approval supplement that responded to FDA questions and led to FDA approval of the new formulation of ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in August 2015. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;27, 2015, we announced that we had entered into an assignment and revenue sharing agreement with Meda to return to us the

were collaborating on the transfer of manufacturing, which included submission of a Prior Approval Supplement FDA. Upon approval of the Supplement, the NDA and manufacturing responsibility would have been transferred to Collegium. Financial terms of

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Impairment Testing </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;), goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level annually, or more frequently if indicated by events or conditions. We performed an evaluation and determined that there
is only one reporting unit. We elected to early adopt ASU Update <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">No.&nbsp;2017-04</FONT> Goodwill and other (Topic 350) &#147;simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment&#148; in performing our annual goodwill
impairment test in 2017. Under this accounting guidance, the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill
impairment test was eliminated. Therefore, the same impairment assessment under this new accounting standard applies to all reporting units. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Similar to previous guidance, the new standard allows for either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment to be performed. If a qualitative
evaluation determines that no impairment exists, then no further analysis is performed. If a qualitative evaluation is unable to determine whether impairment has occurred, a quantitative evaluation is performed. The quantitative impairment test
first identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. Under ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2017-04,</FONT> if
the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recorded based on that difference, which is different than previous GAAP. Under previous GAAP, if the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an entity was required to calculate the
implied fair value of goodwill (Step 2) and record an impairment if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
determination of goodwill impairment is highly subjective. It considers many factors both internal and external and is subject to significant changes from period to period. No goodwill impairment charges have resulted from this analysis for 2017,
2016 or 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">An impairment of a long-lived asset other than goodwill is recognized under GAAP if the carrying value of the asset (or the
group of assets of which it is a part) exceeds (i)&nbsp;the future estimated undiscounted cash flow from the use of the asset (or group of assets) and (ii)&nbsp;the fair value of the asset (or asset group). In making this impairment assessment, we
predominately use an undiscounted cash flow model derived from internal forecasts. Factors that could change the result of our impairment test include, but are not limited to, different assumptions used to forecast future net sales, expenses,
capital expenditures, and working capital requirements used in our cash flow models. If our management determines that the value of intangible assets have become impaired using this approach, we will record an accounting charge for the impairment.
No impairment charges have been recorded for other amortizing intangibles in 2017, 2016 or 2015. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>The Assigned Value of Acquired Tangible and
Intangible Assets and Assumed and Contingent Liabilities Associated with Business Combinations </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We account for acquisitions of
businesses using the acquisition method of accounting where the cost is allocated to the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired, based on their respective estimated fair values. If the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired
is more than the purchase price, the excess is immediately recorded in earnings as a bargain purchase gain. Alternatively, if the purchase price is greater than the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired, the excess is recorded as
goodwill. Determining the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the selection of appropriate valuation
methodology, projected revenue, expenses and cash flows, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates and estimates of terminal values. Business acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of the
acquisition. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Inventory Valuation </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We
provide inventory write-downs determined primarily by the accumulated cost to manufacture our inventory, which is impacted by component costs and manufacturing yields. The write-down is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory
and net realizable value and charged to cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in
that newly established cost basis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We provide a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories identified by a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">lot-by-lot</FONT></FONT> analysis of our finished goods inventory which considers the expiration dates and future demand forecasts. The write-down is measured as the difference between the
cost of the inventory <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-hand</FONT> and the expected demand of the inventory. At the point of the loss recognition, a charge to cost of sales is recorded and a reserve is established for that inventory. The
inventory reserve is relieved upon the future sale or disposal of that inventory. </P>

provision of clinical trial material (or CTM). The amounts involved are, however, immaterial and delivered in essentially the same time frame as the clinical development services. Accordingly, we did not separately account for the CTM deliverable,

thresholds as outlined in the Endo Agreement. Endo reimbursed us for this spending at cost and we received no <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mark-up</FONT> or profit. The gross amount of these reimbursed research and development costs were
reported as research and development reimbursement revenue. We acted as a principal, had discretion to choose suppliers, bear credit risk and may perform part of the services required in the transactions. Therefore, these reimbursements were treated
as revenue to us. The actual expenses creating the reimbursements are reflected as research and development expense. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we recognized $0.9&nbsp;million, of reimbursable expenses related to the Endo

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued Accounting Standards Update
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2014-09,</FONT> &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers,&#148; which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;ASC&#148;) Topic 605, &#147;Revenue
Recognition&#148; and most industry-specific guidance on revenue recognition throughout the ASC. The standard&#146;s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today&#146;s guidance. In August 2015, the FASB
issued ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2015-14,</FONT> which defers the effective date of ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2014-09</FONT> for all entities by one year. Accordingly, public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2014-09</FONT> to annual reporting periods (including interim periods within those periods) beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. The standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented (full
retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application (modified retrospective&nbsp;method). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We used the modified retrospective approach upon adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2018 using a cumulative effect adjustment to
accumulated deficit. We utilized a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of the guidance on our contract portfolio. We reviewed our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences resulting from the application of
the new requirements to our revenue contracts, including evaluation of performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to each separate
performance obligation and accounting treatment of costs to obtain and fulfill contracts. In addition, we will update certain disclosures, as applicable, included in our financial statements to meet the requirements of the new guidance beginning in
January&nbsp;1, 2018. Under the </P>

new guidance, we are required to evaluate the impact of estimating variable consideration related to our product sales and licensing contracts. We will use the expected value method to estimate
the total revenue of the contract, constrained by the probability that there would not be a significant revenue reversal in a future period. We will continue to evaluate the expected value of revenue over the term of the contract and adjust revenue
recognition as appropriate. Based on this evaluation, the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, accounting policies, business processes, internal controls or disclosures. </P>

reject products that do not comply with product, packaging, or regulatory specifications. Defective product must be identified by Meda within 10 days after inspection at Meda&#146;s distribution site. We bill Meda immediately upon receipt by Meda of
product (FOB manufacturer). On a quarterly basis, a reconciliation is prepared that reflects the difference between actual net sales by Meda multiplied by the royalty percentage, and the actual royalty payments made during the quarter (which is

(b)&nbsp;delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (c)&nbsp;our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and (d)&nbsp;collectability is reasonably assured. We sell our products primarily to large national wholesalers, which have the
right to return the products they purchase. We recognize revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product at the time of sale only if (1)&nbsp;Our price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the
date of sale, (2)&nbsp;the buyer has paid us, or the buyer is obligated to pay us and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product, (3)&nbsp;the buyer&#146;s obligation to us would not be changed in the event of theft or physical
destruction or damage of the product, (4)&nbsp;the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from any provided by us, (5)&nbsp;we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of
the product by the buyer, and (6)&nbsp;the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. We recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for rebates, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks and prompt payment discounts. Given the
sufficient experience with BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, we can reasonably estimate the amount of future product returns, and therefore, the

United States enacted major tax reform legislation, Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (or 2017 Tax Act). The 2017 Tax Act, among other changes, lowers the general corporate income tax rate to&nbsp;21% for tax
years beginning after December 31, 2017, transitions U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and provides for a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as
of December 31, 2017, which is not applicable to us. We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act in our income tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2017, in accordance with its understanding of the 2017 Tax Act
and guidance available as of the date of this filing and do not believe it will be material to our results of operations. The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on the tax rates at
which they are expected to reverse in the future. The estimated amount recorded related to the remeasurement of these balances was an income tax benefit of&nbsp;$33.1 million, offset entirely by the reduction in our valuation allowance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (&#147;SAB 118&#148;) was issued to address the application of US GAAP in situations
when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. In accordance with SAB 118, we
have determined that the $33.1 million of the deferred tax income offset by the reduction in valuation allowance recorded in connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and the expectation the transition tax is
immaterial are reasonable estimates at December 31, 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, North Carolina reduced its corporate income tax rate from 4% to 3%

benefit of $16.0 million in 2017. This benefit was associated with the release of our valuation allowance triggered by the recognition of deferred tax liabilities recorded as part of the Endo
BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> transaction. We did not record income tax expense or pay any income tax in 2016 as we had incurred a net operating loss. We have recognized valuation allowances for all deferred tax
assets for years ending 2017 and 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We are required to reduce any deferred tax asset by a valuation allowance if, based on an
assessment of positive and negative evidence, including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount which is more likely than not to be realized. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance with respect to all our deferred
tax assets. The change in the valuation allowance for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 independent of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act was $(4.4 million). In addition to the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets due to the 2017 Tax Act,
the valuation allowance decreased in 2017 due primarily to changes in the intangible assets and deferred revenue offset partially by stock compensation and an increase in our net operating loss carryforwards. </P>

$40.4&nbsp;million in two milestone payments from Endo associated with submission and subsequent approval by the FDA of the NDA for BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. Also included in 2015 was $1.1&nbsp;million in

expenses.&nbsp;These costs also include legal and professional fees, wages, and stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016 can be attributed to the conversion of the contract sales force
into one employed by us, which reduced administrative costs and inefficiencies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Interest Expense, Net.</I> During the year ended

secured loan facility from MidCap. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 we had net interest expense of&nbsp;$2.5&nbsp;million, consisting of&nbsp;$2.0&nbsp;million of scheduled interest payments and $0.5&nbsp;million of related amortization
of discount and loan costs associated with the July 2015 secured loan facility from MidCap. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Income Tax Expense and Tax Net Operating
Loss Carryforwards.</I> We had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs of approximately $225&nbsp;million and $258&nbsp;million, respectively at December&nbsp;31, 2016 as compared to federal and state NOLs of $168&nbsp;million and
$178&nbsp;million, respectively as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.&nbsp;These loss carryforwards expire principally beginning in 2020 through 2035 for federal and 2030 for state purposes, respectively. In accordance with GAAP, it is required that a
deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount which is more likely than not to be realized. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance with respect to all of our deferred tax assets. Under
Section&nbsp;382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if an ownership change occurs with respect to a &#147;loss corporation&#148; (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code), there are annual limitations on the amount of the net operating loss and
other deductions which are available to us. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Expenditures for Research and Development Programs (2016 vs. 2015) </I></P>

extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesic drug products to conduct four post-marketing studies regarding risks associated with their long-term use and one clinical trial to estimate risk of hyperalgesia.&nbsp;The FDA replaced the
original requirements with new post-marketing requirements in February 2016. The Opioid PMR Consortium was formed with representatives from each of the member companies providing an opportunity for one set of studies to be completed to satisfy the
FDA requirements and distributing the associated costs across all member companies. Each member company pays an equal share of the program costs and new members are required to pay equal share of the costs to date upon program entry and of future
costs going forward. We joined the Opioid PMR Consortium in October 2017 and our initial share of the program cost was paid in late 2017. To date, six of eleven studies have been completed and the program is expected to continue into 2020. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Loan Agreement with CRG has <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">a&nbsp;six-year&nbsp;term</FONT>
with the first three years of interest-only payments (which can be extended to four years if we achieve certain net revenue and market capitalization thresholds prior to December&nbsp;31, 2019), after which quarterly principal and interest payments
will be due through the December&nbsp;31, 2022 maturity date. Interest on the amounts borrowed under the Loan Agreement accrues at an annual fixed rate of 12.50%, 3.5% of which (i.e., a resultant 9.0% rate) may be deferred during the interest-only
period by adding such amount to the aggregate principal loan amount. On each borrowing date (including the initial closing we are required to pay CRG a financing fee based on the loan drawn on that date. We are also required to pay the Lenders a
final payment fee upon repayment of the Loans in full, in addition to prepayment amounts described below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We may prepay all or a portion
of the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest under the Loan Agreement at any time upon prior notice to the Lenders subject to a certain prepayment fees during the first five years of the term (which fees are lowered over time) and no
prepayment fee thereafter. In certain circumstances, including a change of control and certain asset sales or licensing transactions, we are required to prepay all or a portion of the loan, including the applicable prepayment premium of on the
amount of the outstanding principal to be prepaid. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As security for our obligations under the Loan Agreement, on the funding date of the
initial borrowing, we and our subsidiaries entered into a security agreement with CRG whereby we granted to CRG, as collateral agent for the Lenders, a lien on substantially all our assets including intellectual property (subject to certain
exceptions). The Loan Agreement requires us to maintain an agreed to minimum cash and cash equivalents balance and, each year through the end of 2022, to meet a minimum net annual revenue threshold. In the event that we do not meet the minimum net
annual revenue threshold, then we can satisfy the requirement for that year by raising two (2)&nbsp;times the shortfall by way of raising equity or subordinated debt. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Loan Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for a credit facility of this size and type, including covenants
that limit or restrict our ability to, among other things (but subject in each case to negotiated exceptions), incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make investments, make acquisitions, enter into transactions
with affiliates, pay dividends or make distributions, license intellectual property rights on an exclusive basis or repurchase stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The
Loan Agreement includes customary events of default that include, among other <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">things,&nbsp;non-payment,&nbsp;inaccuracy</FONT> of representations and warranties, covenant breaches, a material adverse change (as
defined in the Loan Agreement), cross default to material indebtedness or material agreements, bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments and a change of control. The occurrence and continuance of an event of default could result in the
acceleration of the obligations under the Loan Agreement. Under certain circumstances, a default interest rate of an additional 4.00%&nbsp;per annum will apply on all outstanding obligations during the existence of an event of default under the Loan
Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the initial borrowing made under the Loan Agreement on February&nbsp;21, 2017, we issued to CRG and certain
of its affiliates five separate warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,701,582 shares of our Common Stock (or the CRG Warrants).&nbsp;The CRG Warrants are exercisable any time prior to February&nbsp;21, 2027 at a price of $2.38 per share, with
typical provisions for cashless exercise and stock-based anti-dilution protection. The exercise of the CRG Warrants could have a dilutive effect to our Common Stock to the extent that the market price per share of the Common Stock, as measured under
the terms of the CRG Warrants, exceeds the exercise price of the CRG Warrants. CRG is also entitled to receive a smaller amount of similar warrants concurrently with the funding, if applicable, of the Third Draw. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Second Draw, we issued to&nbsp;CRG&nbsp;and certain of its affiliates warrants to purchase an aggregate of 349,452
shares of our Common Stock (or the CRG&nbsp;Second Draw Warrants). The&nbsp;CRG&nbsp;Second Draw Warrants are exercisable any time prior to December&nbsp;26, 2027, at a price of $3.42 per share, with typical provisions for cashless exercise and
stock-based anti-dilution protection. The exercise of the&nbsp;CRG&nbsp;Second Draw Warrants could have a dilutive effect to our Common Stock to the extent that the market price per share of our Common Stock, as measured under the terms of
the&nbsp;CRG&nbsp;Second Draw Warrants, exceeds the exercise price of the&nbsp;CRG&nbsp;Warrants. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At December&nbsp;31, 2017, we had cash
and cash equivalents of approximately $21.2&nbsp;million. We used $32.5&nbsp;million of cash in operations during the twelve months ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and had stockholders&#146; equity of $8.9&nbsp;million, versus stockholders&#146;
deficit of $17.7&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2016. We expect that we have sufficient cash to manage our business as currently planned into the second quarter of 2019, which includes access to additional capital from the CRG loan of
$15&nbsp;million if we satisfy the third draw requirements as well as equity markets if we choose or a combination of both that would&nbsp;provide sufficient capital necessary to support the commercialization of BELBUCA<SUP

our cash requirements. As a result of our late filing of certain financing information related to its reacquisition of BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, we are unable to utilize our universal shelf registration

all independent directors have been members of each board committee. In October 2013, our committees reorganized, and subsequently there were changes to the committee composition. All standing committees (as well as our former Lead Director) operate
under a charter that has been approved by the board. Our board of directors has also, from time to time, appointed <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-standing</FONT> committees to assist the board in its duties to our company. The charters for

will seek to evaluate candidates to serve on our board of directors. The evaluation methodology includes a scored system based on criteria including items such as experience in the biotechnology sector, experience with public companies, executive
managerial experience, operations and commercial experience, fundraising experience and contacts in the investment banking industry, personal and skill set compatibility with current board members, industry reputation, knowledge of our company
generally, independence and ethnic and gender diversity. While diversity is considered as a board qualification criteria, it would not be weighted any more or less in an evaluation process than any other criteria. The established criteria do not
distinguish board candidates based on whether the candidate is recommended by a stockholder of our company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Compensation Committee

necessary to carry out its responsibilities in determining the amount and form of employee, executive and director compensation.&nbsp;In 2017, the Compensation Committee engaged Radford, an AON Consulting Company, to obtain market data against which
it has measured the competitiveness of our compensation programs.&nbsp;In determining the amount and form of employee, executive and director compensation, the Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed historical salary information as well
as salaries for similar positions at comparable companies. We paid consultant fees to Radford of $0.04&nbsp;million in 2017. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Lead

take into consideration regional market data in determining appropriate compensation packages, and we have in the past relied on Radford to provide us with such data. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Elements of Our Compensation Program and Why We Chose Each </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Main Compensation Components </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our company-wide compensation program, including for our NEOs, is broken down into three main components: base salary, performance cash bonuses
and potential long-term compensation in the form of stock options or restricted stock units (or RSUs). We believe these three components constitute the minimum essential elements of a competitive compensation package in our industry. We also have a
Performance Long Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to herein as the LTIP) for our NEOs and selected senior officers, which compensates such employees with RSUs based on our achievement of certain
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-determined</FONT> revenue performance goals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Salary </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Base salary is used to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of our NEOs as well as recognizing the
competitive nature of the biopharmaceutical industry. This is determined partially by evaluating our peer companies as well as the degree of responsibility and experience levels of our NEOs and their overall contributions to our company. Base salary
is one component of the compensation package for NEOs; the other components being cash bonuses, annual equity grants, a&nbsp;long-term incentive plan and our benefit programs. Base salary is determined in advance whereas the other components of
compensation are awarded in varying degrees following an assessment of the performance of a NEO.&nbsp;This approach to compensation reflects the philosophy of our board of directors and its Compensation Committee to emphasize and reward, on an
annual basis, performance levels achieved by our NEOs, and to provide appropriate retention incentives based on future performance. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Performance Cash Bonus Plan </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have a performance cash bonus plan under which bonuses are paid to our NEOs based on achievement of our performance goals and objectives
established by the Compensation Committee and/or our board of directors as well as on individual performance. The bonus program is discretionary and is intended to: (i)&nbsp;strengthen the connection between individual compensation and our
achievements; (ii)&nbsp;encourage teamwork among all disciplines within our company; (iii)&nbsp;reinforce our <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pay-for-performance</FONT></FONT> philosophy by awarding higher bonuses
to higher performing employees; and (iv)&nbsp;help ensure that our cash compensation is competitive. Depending on our company&#146;s cash position, the Compensation Committee and our board of directors have the discretion after consulting with our
NEOs to not pay (or pay more limited) cash bonuses in order that we may conserve cash and support ongoing development programs and commercialization efforts. Regardless of our cash position, we consistently grant annual merit-based stock options
(and, more recently in the case of senior executives, RSUs) to continue incentivizing both our senior management and our employees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based
on their employment agreements, each NEO is assigned a target payout under the performance cash bonus plan, expressed as a percentage of base salary for the year. Actual payouts under the performance cash bonus plan are based on the achievement of
corporate performance goals and an assessment of individual performance, each of which is separately weighted as a component of such officer&#146;s target payout. For the NEOs, the corporate goals receive the highest weighting to ensure that the
bonus system for our management team is closely tied to our corporate performance. Each employee also has specific individual goals and objectives as well that are tied to the overall corporate goals. For employees,
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">mid-year</FONT> and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">end-of-year</FONT></FONT> progress is reviewed with the employees&#146; managers. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Equity Incentive Compensation </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We view long-term compensation, currently in the form of stock options and RSUs, which generally vest in annual increments over three years
(other than awards under our LTIP, which vest immediately if awarded, and performance based awards as described below), as a tool to align the interests of our NEOs and employees generally with the creation of stockholder value, to motivate our
employees to achieve and exceed corporate and individual objectives and to encourage them to remain employed by us. While cash compensation is a significant component of employees&#146; overall compensation, the Compensation Committee and our board
of directors (as well as our NEOs) believe that the driving force of any employee working in a small biotechnology company should be strong equity participation. We believe that this not only creates the potential for substantial longer term
corporate value but also serves to motivate employees and retain their loyalty and commitment with appropriate personal compensation over a longer period of time. Our equity awards are granted under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (as the same may be
amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time, which we refer to herein as the Plan). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since January 2017, it is our policy to
grant equity incentive awards with two types of vesting: time-based and performance-based. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Time-based vesting</I>. The Compensation
Committee believes that because time-vested stock options and RSUs have a three-year vesting schedule that begins one year after the date of the award, the equity grants constitute a significant retention incentive and a tool to foster continuity of
management, an important factor for a company with a relatively low number of employees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Performance-based vesting</I>. Based on the
Compensation Committee&#146;s review in 2017 of current market practices, pronouncements by corporate governance advisory services and discussions with our institutional investors, beginning with the annual equity awards granted to senior executives
(including our NEOs) in February 2017, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> of the RSUs granted are performance based and vest over a three-year period based on the level of achievement of specified predetermined net revenue and
operating income targets, with the remaining <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> being time vested as described above. In March 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that the 2017 performance-based RSU 1/3<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">rd</SUP> grant would vest at a rate of 85.5% according to the achievement of the aforementioned targets. Such RSUs will vest on the first open window after the filing of our Annual Report on Form <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K.</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Performance Long Term Incentive Plan </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2012, in anticipation of the commencement of revenue generating operations by our company by means of product commercialization,
the Compensation Committee approved our LTIP. The LTIP is designed as an incentive for our senior management (including our NEOs) to generate revenue for us. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The LTIP consists of RSUs (which, for purposes of the Plan, are defined as and considered (and which we refer to herein as Performance RSUs),
which are rights to acquire shares of our common stock. All Performance RSUs granted under the LTIP will be granted under the Plan as &#147;Performance Compensation Awards&#148; under such plan. The participants in the LTIP are either NEOs or senior
officers of ours. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of the LTIP began with our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 and lasts through our fiscal year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2019. The total number of Performance RSUs covered by the LTIP is 1,078,000, of which an aggregate of 978,000 were awarded in 2012 (and an aggregate of 35,000 in 2015). The Performance RSUs under the LTIP did not vest upon
granting, but instead are subject to potential vesting each year over the eight-year term of the LTIP depending on the achievement of revenue by us, as reported in our Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K.</FONT> During 2013,
2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, an aggregate of 8,986, 4,447, 21,356, 13,347 and 33,811 Performance RSUs vested, respectively. Performance RSUs will be valued on the day of issuance and will vest annually on the last day preceding the first open trading
window after filing our Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT> based on the revenue achieved during the prior fiscal year as a proportion of the total cumulative revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP (which we
call the Predefined Cumulative Revenue). Predefined Cumulative Revenue is a predefined aggregate revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP that was determined by the Compensation Committee in conjunction with our executive management. The
Predefined Cumulative Revenue may be adjusted by the Compensation Committee upon the occurrence of extraordinary corporate events during the term of the LTIP (such as acquisitions by us of revenue generating businesses or assets). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Other Compensation </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition to the main components of compensation outlined above, we also provide contractual severance and/or change in control benefits to the NEOs as well as to Scott Plesha, who was appointed as our President as of January&nbsp;2, 2018, (see
&#147;Appointment of President&#148; below), Albert J. Medwar, our Senior Vice President, Corporate and Business Development (who will retire from our company as of April&nbsp;1, 2018 and receive a retirement benefits package that includes equity
features), to Joseph Lockhart, our Senior </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
Vice President Operations, and to James Darnley, our Vice President, General Counsel and Commercial Compliance Officer. The change in control benefits for all applicable persons has a
&#147;double trigger.&#148; A double-trigger means that the executive officers will receive the change in control benefits described in the agreements only if there is both (1)&nbsp;a Change in Control of our company (as defined in the agreements)
and (2)&nbsp;a termination by us of the applicable person&#146;s employment &#147;without cause&#148; or a resignation by the applicable persons for &#147;good reason&#148; (as defined in the agreements) within a specified time period prior to or
following the Change in Control. We believe this double trigger requirement creates the potential to maximize stockholder value because it prevents an unintended windfall to management as no benefits are triggered solely in the event of a Change in
Control while providing appropriate incentives to act in furtherance of a change in control that may be in the best interests of the stockholders. We believe these severances or change in control benefits are important elements of our compensation
program that assist us in retaining talented individuals at the executive and senior managerial levels and that these arrangements help to promote stability and continuity of our executives and senior management team. We also believe that the
interests of our stockholders will be best served if the interests of these members of our management are aligned with theirs. Furthermore, we believe that providing change in control benefits lessens or eliminates any potential reluctance of
members of our management to pursue potential change in control transactions that may be in the best interests of the stockholders. Finally, we believe that it is important to provide severance benefits to members of our management to promote
stability and to focus on the job at hand. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also provide benefits to the executive officers that are generally available to all regular
full-time employees of ours, including our medical and dental insurance, life insurance and a 401(k) match for all individuals who participate in the 401(k) plan. Currently, we do not provide any perquisites to any of our NEOs. Further, we do not
have pension arrangements or post-retirement health coverage for our executive officers or employees. We also do not have deferred compensation plans other than allowing (beginning with respect to RSU awards granted at the beginning of 2017) senior
executive recipients of RSUs to defer payment of RSUs that may vest in future years, subject to compliance with Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code (or the Code) and related rules. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All of our employees not specifically under contract are <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">&#147;at-will&#148;</FONT> employees, which mean
that their employment can be terminated at any time for any reason by either us or the employee. Our NEOs (as well as certain of our senior managers) have employment agreements that provide lump sum compensation in the event of their termination
without cause or, under certain circumstances, upon a Change of Control. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Determination of Compensation Amounts </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Many factors impact the determination of compensation amounts for our NEOs, including the individual&#146;s role in our company and individual
performance, length of service with us, competition for talent, individual compensation package, assessments of internal pay equity and industry data. Stock price performance has generally not been a significant factor in determining annual
compensation because the price of our common stock is subject to a variety of factors outside of our control. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Industry Survey Data
</I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In collaboration with Radford, each year our Compensation Committee establishes a list of peer companies to best ensure that we are
compensating our executives on a fair and reasonable basis, as set forth above under the heading &#147;Objectives of our Compensation Program.&#148; We also utilize Radford-prepared data for below-executive level personnel, which data focuses on <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">similarly-sized</FONT> life science companies in the Southeastern region of the United States. The availability of peer data is used by the Compensation Committee strictly as a guide in determining compensation levels
regarding salaries, cash bonuses and annual equity grants to all employees. However, the availability of this data does not imply that the Compensation Committee is under any obligation to exactly follow peer companies in compensation matters. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Determination of Base Salaries </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a guideline for NEO base salary, we perform formal benchmarking against respective comparable positions in our established peer group. Our
guideline is to set targeted NEO salary ranges between the 25th and 50th percentile for comparable positions within our peer group. We then adjust salaries based on our assessment of our NEOs&#146; levels of responsibility, experience, overall
compensation structure and individual performance. The Compensation Committee has the discretion if it believes circumstances warrant, to go above the 50th percentile of the peer group. The Compensation Committee is not obliged to raise salaries
purely on the availability of data. Merit-based increases to salaries of executive officers are based on our assessment of individual performance and the relationship to applicable salary ranges. Cost of living adjustments may also be a part of that
assessment. The Compensation Committee, in recent years, has tended to maintain cash compensation levels at or near the 50th percentile but to exceed that level in determining equity compensation. The emphasis on equity compensation reflects the
Committee&#146;s objective, given that we have only recently engaged in revenue generating operations, to incentivize personnel and to preserve cash in a prudent manner and yet reward personnel for outstanding performance. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Concurrently with the beginning of each calendar year, preliminary corporate goals that reflect our business priorities for the coming year are
prepared by our NEOs with input from other officers. The draft goals are presented to the Compensation Committee and our full board at the beginning of each year and discussed, revised as necessary, and then approved by our board of directors. The
Compensation Committee then reviews the final goals to determine and confirm their appropriateness for use as performance measurements for purposes of the bonus program. The goals may be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-visited</FONT> during the
year and potentially restated in the event of significant changes in corporate strategy or the occurrence of significant corporate events.&nbsp;Following the agreement of our board of directors on the corporate objectives, the goals are then shared
with all employees in a formal meeting(s), and are reviewed periodically throughout the year at monthly staff meetings and quarterly board of director meetings. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The performance cash bonus plan for our executive officers and employees in 2017 was adopted by the Compensation Committee in February 2017.
The plan sets forth target bonus opportunities, as a percentage of salary, based on the level of responsibility of the position, ranging up to 60% of salary for Dr.&nbsp;Sirgo, who served as CEO in 2017, up to 40% of salary for our NEOs and up to
30% of salary for certain other officers. In setting these percentages, the Compensation Committee determined that the above percentages were reasonable and in line with our peer group. Each employee has the opportunity to achieve up to 100% of his
targeted amount, depending on how corporate goals and objectives are achieved, with variances on an &#147;employee by employee&#148; basis to be determined by our Compensation Committee in consultation with senior executives and employees&#146;
direct reports. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Determination of Equity Incentive Compensation </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To assist us in assessing the reasonableness of our equity grant amounts, historically we have reviewed Radford supplied information and, prior
to Radford, we used information supplied by Equilar, Inc. Such information included equity data from a cross-section of the companies in the above-mentioned surveys. Initially, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-hire</FONT> stock option grant
amounts have generally been targeted at the 25th to 50th percentile for that position or similar industry position, adjusted for internal equity, experience level of the individual and the individual&#146;s total mix of compensation and benefits
provided in his or her offer package. Initial <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-hire</FONT> grants typically vest over three years. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
granting equity awards in 2015 as well as prior years, the Compensation Committee utilized a methodology that computed the financial value of the equity granted, applying as a general guideline, a peer group percentile ranging from the 50th to the
75th percentile. At that time, however, the Committee made an exception to the general policy by approving special equity awards to five senior executives (including Dr.&nbsp;Sirgo) in recognition of long-standing contributions to achieving
strategic objectives first established more than 10 years earlier. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Beginning in January 2016, the Compensation Committee expanded its
criteria for equity awards, considering not only the financial value of awards, but also the &#147;burn rate&#148; (meaning the number of shares awarded as a percentage of total outstanding shares). These two criteria (i.e. financial value and burn
rate) often result in disparate computations when contrasted to peer group criteria. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee has attempted to equitably balance those two factors to achieve appropriate equity awards. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In early 2017, with respect to equity awards to senior executives, including NEOs, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> of the
RSUs were awarded in the form of time-based RSUs, as have been exclusively awarded to those executives in recent years, and for the first time, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> of the RSUs were in the form of performance-based RSUs
as described above. This same formula was again used in February 2018. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For a discussion of equity awards made in early 2018, see

internal equity guidelines. Current market conditions for grants for comparable positions and internal equity may also be assessed. Also, grants may be made relating to promotions or <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">job-</FONT> related changes in responsibilities. In addition, on occasion, the Compensation Committee may make special awards for extraordinary individual or our company performance and, as was the case in early 2015, of
achievement over an extended period of time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Compensation Setting Process </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the first of the year, meetings of our board of directors and the Compensation Committee, overall corporate performance and relative
achievement of the corporate goals for the prior year are assessed. The relative achievement of each goal is assessed and the summation of the individual components results in an overall corporate goal rating, expressed as a percentage. The
Compensation Committee then approves the final disbursement of salary increases, cash bonuses and option or RSU grants, giving an 80% weight factor to the corporate goal rating, and a 20% weight factor for such other performance criteria the
Committee may in its discretion deem relevant at the time of the granting awards. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Also near the end of the year, the CEO evaluates the
individual performance of each NEO (other than himself) and provides the Compensation Committee with an assessment of the performance of such NEO. In determining the individual performance ratings of the NEOs, we assess performance against many
factors, including each NEO&#146;s relative contributions to our corporate goals, demonstrated career growth, level of performance in the face of available resources and other challenges, and the respective officer&#146;s department&#146;s overall
performance. This assessment is conducted in a holistic fashion, in contrast to the summation of individual components as is done to arrive at the corporate goal rating. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following a qualitative assessment of each individual NEO&#146;s performance, our policies provide guidelines for translating this performance
assessment into a numerical rating. Both the initial qualitative assessment and the translation into a numerical rating are made by the Compensation Committee on a discretionary basis. We believe that conducting a discretionary assessment for the
individual component of the NEOs&#146; performance provides for flexibility in the evaluation of our NEOs and their adaptability to addressing potential changes in our priorities throughout the year. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Compensation Committee looks to the CEO&#146;s performance assessments of the other NEOs and his recommendations regarding a performance
rating for each, as well as input from the other members of our board of directors. These recommendations may be adjusted by the Compensation Committee prior to finalization. For the CEO, the Compensation Committee evaluates his performance, taking
into consideration input from the other members of our board of directors, and considers the achievement of overall corporate objectives by both the CEO specifically and our company generally. The CEO is not present during the Compensation
Committee&#146;s deliberations regarding his compensation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The CEO may also present any recommended changes to base salary and
recommendations for annual equity grant amounts for NEOs and other senior executives. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Compensation Committee has the authority to
directly engage, at our expense, any compensation consultants or other advisors (such as Radford) that it deems necessary to determine the amount and form of employee, executive and director compensation. In determining the amount and form of
employee, executive and director compensation, the Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed historical salary information as well as salaries for similar positions at comparable companies. However, the availability of this data does not
imply that the Compensation Committee is under any obligation to exactly follow peer companies&#146; compensation practices. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We paid
consultant fees to Radford of $0.04&nbsp;million in 2017. NEOs may have indirect input in the compensation results for other executive officers by virtue of their participation in the performance review and feedback process for the other executive
officers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Compensation Decisions for Performance in 2017 </B></P>

generally disappointing. Sales objectives were not met and we decided not to pursue an additional dosage. We did achieve stated goals in reducing cost of goods and in significantly improving production and inventory efficiencies. We were not

successfully executed a new loan agreement for the financing of our operations for the year and into 2018. We continued our success in the areas of intellectual property litigation. We were not able, however, to augment our product line by <FONT

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">After reviewing the achievement of the corporate goals and objectives for 2017 as noted above, the Compensation Committee determined that all
NEOs should be awarded a cash bonus at 70% of their target. A cash bonus pool, equal to 70% of the aggregate of individual bonus opportunities of all other employees, plus $72,500, was established with our executives having the authority to award
individual bonuses from that pool with respect to these employees who reported to them. The cost of all such cash bonuses for 2017 performance (but paid in March 2018) was approximately $0.4&nbsp;million for NEOs and approximately $0.7&nbsp;million
for employees. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Equity Awards in February 2018 </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In making annual equity awards in February, 2018, the Compensation Committee continued, with respect to senior executives including our NEOs, a
policy first initiated in the prior year, specifically the inclusion of a meaningful element of performance benchmarks to is equity awards. Consequently, equity awards to these executives in February, 2018, are in the form of RSUs, <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> of which are time-based and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-half</FONT> of which are performance-based, all of which vest over a three-year period beginning in the first year after the date of grant.
The performance-based RSUs provide for vesting if specified net revenue and operating income goals are achieved with respect to the three annual fiscal years beginning with the year in which an award was made. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the beginning of 2018, the total amount of the RSUs awarded to our NEOs and senior executives for 2017 performance (after adjusting
pursuant to applicable retirement agreements) was 870,306 RSUs having an approximate value on the date preceding the grant of $1.8&nbsp;million based on a share price of $2.10. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All other employees of ours (excluding only certain recently-hired persons) were granted stock options priced at the <FONT

Those salary levels were approximately at the 50% percentile of our peer group and therefore consistent with our compensation philosophy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dr.&nbsp;Sirgo was awarded a cash bonus for 2017 in the amount of $247,800, which is 70% of his target bonus of 60% of his base salary in

In addition, under Dr.&nbsp;Sirgo&#146;s management, we continued to have success in ongoing litigation with respect to our intellectual property and patent portfolio and we successfully negotiated a loan agreement providing sufficient financing for

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In December 2012, by unanimous written consent following significant planning and discussion (as well as discussion with our outside
compensation consultant Radford), the Committee approved the LTIP. The LTIP is designed as an incentive for our senior management (including our NEOs) to generate revenue for our company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The LTIP consists of RSUs (as defined under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan) which are rights to acquire shares of our common stock. All
Performance RSUs granted under the LTIP will be granted under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (as the same may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time) as &#147;Performance Compensation Awards&#148; under such plan. The participants
in the LTIP are either NEOs or senior officers of our company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of the LTIP began with our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31,
2012 and lasts through our fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2019. The total number of Performance RSUs covered by the LTIP is 1,078,000, of which 978,000 were awarded in 2012 and 35,000 were awarded November 2015 (the remaining 319,676
Performance RSUs being reserved for future hires, which includes forfeitures). A total of 9,958, 23,853, 21,356, 4,447 and 8,986 RSUs vested during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Performance RSUs
under the LTIP did not vest upon granting, but instead are subject to potential vesting each year over the 8 year term of the LTIP depending on the achievement of revenue by our company, as reported in our Annual Report on Form <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K.</FONT> Performance RSUs will be valued on the day of issuance and will vest annually on the last day preceding the first open window after filing our Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K</FONT>
based on the revenue achieved during the prior fiscal year as a proportion of the total cumulative revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP (which we call the Predefined Cumulative Revenue). Predefined Cumulative Revenue is a predefined
aggregate revenue target for the entire term of the LTIP that was determined by the Committee in conjunction with our executive management. The Predefined Cumulative Revenue may be adjusted by the Committee upon the occurrence of extraordinary
corporate events during the term of the LTIP (such as acquisitions by our company of revenue generating businesses or assets). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Compensation Committee

entered into with related parties, as well as review and ratify all future related party transactions. The audit committee and/or our independent directors independently reviewed, ratified and/or approved, as the case may be, the agreements

biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. BSP to date has not distributed any pharmaceutical products. Under this agreement, BSP will serve as a nonexclusive distributor of our products in consideration of a ten (10%)&nbsp;percent
discount to the wholesale price, which our board of directors has determined to be commercially reasonable. BSP has waived its rights under this agreement with respect to Arius&#146; products which include the BEMA<SUP

from unaffiliated third parties. At the time of certain of the above referenced transactions, we did not have sufficient disinterested directors to ratify or approve the transactions; however, the present board of directors includes five independent
directors which constitute a majority as required by NASDAQ Stock Market rules. We believe that William M Watson, Samuel P. Sears, Jr., Thomas W. D&#146;Alonzo, Barry I. Feinberg and Timothy C. Tyson qualify as independent directors for NASDAQ Stock
Market purposes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All future transactions between us and our officers, directors or five percent stockholders, and respective affiliates

<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of
December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders&#146; equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, the related notes, and Schedule
II &#150; Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and Reserves (the &#147;financial statements&#148;). We also have audited the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2017, based on criteria established in
<I>Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013)</I>&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2017, based on criteria established in <I>Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013)</I>&nbsp;issued by COSO. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Emphasis of Matter </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As discussed in Note 2 to the
financial statements, during 2017, the Company experienced negative cash flows of approximately $10.8&nbsp;million and, at December&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company had incurred cumulative net losses of approximately $305.1&nbsp;million. Management&#146;s
plans in regard to this matter are described in Note 2. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Basis for Opinion </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A &#150; Controls and Procedures in the Company&#146;s
2017 Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K.</FONT> Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s financial statements and an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (&#147;PCAOB&#148;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:8pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our audits of the financial statements included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:10pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We have served as the

Company purchases its pharmaceutical ingredients pursuant to long-term supply agreements with a limited number of suppliers. The failure of a supplier, including a subcontractor, to deliver on schedule could delay or interrupt the development or
commercialization process and thereby adversely affect the Company&#146;s operating results. In addition, a disruption in the commercial supply of or a significant increase in the cost of the API from any of these sources could have a material
adverse effect on the Company&#146;s BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> business, which would affect the Company&#146;s financial position and

STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> supply delays.&nbsp;Amounts due to these vendors represented approximately 22.8% and 5.6% of total accounts payable as of December&nbsp;31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. </P>

number of suppliers. This could result in the Company&#146;s inability to timely obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduce control over pricing, quality and timely delivery. Also, if the supply of any components is interrupted,
components from alternative suppliers may not be available in sufficient volumes within required time frames, if at all, to meet the Company&#146;s obligations under certain supply agreements. This could delay timely commercialization efforts
causing the Company&#146;s obligations to not be fulfilled. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company sells its

sale, (2)&nbsp;the buyer has paid the Company, or the buyer is obligated to pay the Company and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product, (3)&nbsp;the buyer&#146;s obligation to the Company would not be changed in the event of theft

data purchased from a third-party data provider to develop estimates of historical inventory channel sell-through. The Company utilizes an internal analysis to compare historical net product shipments to estimated historical prescriptions written.
Based on that analysis, management develops an estimate of the quantity of product in the channel which may be subject to various rebate, chargeback and product return exposures. To estimate months of ending inventory in the Company&#146;s
distribution channel, the Company divides estimated ending inventory in the distribution channel by the Company&#146;s recent prescription data, not considering any future anticipated demand growth beyond the succeeding quarter. Monthly for each
product line, the Company prepares an internal estimate of ending inventory units in the distribution channel by adding estimated inventory in the channel at the beginning of the period, plus net product shipments for the period, less estimated
prescriptions written for the period. This is done for each product line by applying a rate of historical activity for rebates, chargebacks and product returns, adjusted for relevant quantitative and qualitative factors discussed above, to the
potential exposed product estimated to be in the distribution channel. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Product returns</I>-Consistent with industry practice, the

of price adjustments and chargebacks are based on its estimated mix of sales to various third-party payers, which are entitled either contractually or statutorily to discounts from the Company&#146;s listed prices of its products. If the sales mix
to third-party payers is different from the Company&#146;s estimates, the Company may be required to pay higher or lower total price adjustments and/or chargebacks than it had estimated, and such differences may be significant. </P>

service period, net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. The fair values of performance-based RSUs are recognized as compensation expense from the grant date to the end of the performance period. The Company uses the
fair-value based method to determine compensation for all arrangements under which employees and others receive shares of stock or equity instruments (warrants and options). The grant date fair value of an RSU equals the closing price of our common
stock on the trading day preceding the grant date. The fair value of each option and warrant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model that uses assumptions for expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term,
and the risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company&#146;s Common Stock and other factors estimated over the expected term of the options. The expected term of options granted is derived using the
&#147;simplified method&#148; which computes expected term as the average of the sum of the vesting term plus the contract term. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield. </P>

January 1, 2018 using a cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. The Company utilized a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of the guidance on its contract portfolio. The Company reviewed its current accounting policies and
practices to identify potential differences resulting from the application of the new requirements to its revenue contracts, including evaluation of performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include
in the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation and accounting treatment of costs to obtain and fulfill contracts. In addition, the Company will update certain disclosures, as applicable, included
in our financial statements to meet the requirements of the new guidance beginning in January&nbsp;1, 2018. Under the new guidance, the Company is required to evaluate the impact of estimating variable consideration related to our product sales and
licensing contracts. The Company will use the expected value method to estimate the total revenue of the contract, constrained by the probability that there would not be a significant revenue reversal in a future period. The Company will continue to
evaluate the expected value of revenue over the term of the contract and adjust revenue recognition as appropriate. Based on this evaluation, the adoption will not have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financial position, results of
operations, cash flows, accounting policies, business processes, internal controls or disclosures. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The FASB&#146;s new leases standard,
ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2016-02</FONT> Leases (Topic 842), was issued on February&nbsp;25, 2016. ASU <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">2016-02</FONT> is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The ASU affects
all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment. The ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as &#147;Lessees&#148; to recognize on the balance sheet the assets
and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. An organization is to provide disclosures designed to enable users of financial statements to understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements concerning additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for
leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or
operating lease. However, unlike current GAAP which requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet, the new ASU will require both types of leases (i.e. operating and capital leases) to be recognized on the balance sheet. The FASB
lessee accounting model will continue to account for both types of leases. The capital lease will be accounted for in substantially the same manner as capital leases are accounted for under existing GAAP. The operating lease will be accounted for in
a manner similar to operating leases under existing GAAP, except that lessees will recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all of those leases. The new standard requires a modified-retrospective approach to adoption and is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2019, but may be adopted earlier. The Company expects to adopt this standard beginning in 2019. The Company does not expect that this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated
statements of operations, but the Company does expect that upon adoption, this standard will impact the carrying value of its assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets as a result of the requirement to record <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">right-of-use</FONT></FONT> assets and corresponding lease obligations for current operating leases. In addition, the standard will require that the Company update its systems, processes and
controls it uses to track, record and account for its lease portfolio. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU

not a business. The new standard also requires that a business include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs.&nbsp;The new guidance will be&nbsp;applied prospectively and is&nbsp;effective for the Company&nbsp;for
interim and annual periods&nbsp;beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this standard beginning in 2018. Adoption of this new standard may result in more transactions being accounted for as
asset acquisitions versus business combinations; however, the impact to the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions. </P>

charges to be based on the first step of the goodwill impairment test under ASC 350. Under previous guidance, if the&nbsp;fair value of a reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount (Step 1), an entity calculates any impairment charge by
comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount (Step 2). The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit from the reporting unit&#146;s fair
value as determined in Step 1. To determine the implied fair value of goodwill, entities estimate the fair value of any unrecognized intangible assets (including <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">in-process</FONT> research and development) and any
corporate-level assets or liabilities that were included in the determination of the carrying amount and fair value of the reporting unit in Step 1.&nbsp;Under this new guidance if a reporting unit&#146;s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an
entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference with such impairment charge limited to the amount of goodwill in the reporting unit. This ASU does not change the guidance on completing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An
entity will still be able to perform today&#146;s optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before determining whether to proceed to Step 1. This ASU will be applied prospectively and is effective for annual and interim impairment tests

$21.2&nbsp;million. The Company used $32.5&nbsp;million of cash in operations during the year-ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and had stockholders&#146; equity of $8.9&nbsp;million, versus stockholders&#146; deficit of $17.7&nbsp;million at
December&nbsp;31, 2016. The Company expects that it has sufficient cash to manage the business as currently planned into the second quarter of 2019, which includes access to additional capital through CRG Servicing LLC (&#147;CRG&#148;) from the CRG
loan of $15&nbsp;million if it satisfies the third draw requirements (see note 11) as well as equity markets if the Company chooses or a combination of both that would&nbsp;provide sufficient capital necessary to support the commercialization of
BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. This estimation assumes that the Company does not otherwise face unexpected events, costs or contingencies, any
of which could affect the Company&#146;s cash requirements from time to time. As a result of the Company&#146;s late filing of certain financing information related to its reacquisition of
BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in 2017, the Company is unable to utilize its universal shelf registration statement and associated

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Additional capital will be required to support the continued commercialization of the Company&#146;s BELBUCA<SUP

Based on product development timelines and agreements with the Company&#146;s development partners, the ability to scale up or reduce personnel and associated costs are factors considered throughout the product development life cycle. Available
resources may be consumed more rapidly than currently anticipated, potentially resulting in the need for additional funding. Additional funding, capital or loans (including, without limitation, milestone or other payments from commercialization
agreements) may be unavailable on favorable terms, if at all. </P>

license terms that commenced on the date of first commercial sale in each respective territory and end on the earlier of the entrance of a generic product to the market or upon expiration date of the last to expire Orange Book listed patents which

concerning BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The purchase price for the net assets (the &#147;Asset Purchase Price&#148;) was equal to the sum of: (i)&nbsp;the aggregate book value of the portion of the transferred
product inventory forecasted to be used or sold by the Company, (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate book value <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">of&nbsp;work-in-progress&nbsp;inventory,</FONT></FONT> and (iii)&nbsp;the assumption
of any assumed liabilities. Together with the Asset Purchase Price, pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Company will also pay to Endo a fee in the amount of $5&nbsp;million in consideration for (i)&nbsp;Endo&#146;s agreement not
to compete for a period of two years from the closing date of the termination agreement and (ii)&nbsp;Endo&#146;s waiver of its right to sell product for twelve months following the closing of the termination agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the closing date, the Company accepted transfer of the net assets and assumed and agreed to discharge when due all applicable liabilities
assumed by the Company, which consisted of post-closing obligations for liabilities and payments associated with the net assets, the assumed contracts related to the net assets and applicable taxes (with the obligation for <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-closing</FONT> and other certain liabilities resulting from the acts or omissions of Endo being retained by Endo). The Asset Purchase Price, together with all other payments (including a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compete</FONT> covenant payment) due to Endo under the Termination Agreement, was payable to Endo in cash in four quarterly installments on the last calendar day of each quarter in 2017. Furthermore, the Company
is not responsible for future royalties or milestone payments to Endo and Endo is not obligated to any future milestone payments to the Company. The Termination Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and mutual releases and
indemnification. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At the closing date, the Company and Endo entered into a Transition Services Agreement which governed the post-closing
rights and responsibilities of the Company and Endo in connection with the license termination and the transfer of the Assets to the Company. Under this agreement, the Company and Endo agreed to the handling of transition matters such as managing
customer contracts, BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> price reporting, payments, returns and rebates, and customer and managed care relations. In connection therewith, Endo has agreed to provide to the Company an
agreed upon number of work hours to be provided by Endo personnel during the transition for certain of these transition services and other assistance with respect to the transition of BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>

combination in accordance with ASC No.&nbsp;805, Business Combinations which, among other things, requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. Determining the fair value of certain acquired
assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the selection of appropriate valuation methodology, projected revenue, expenses and cash flows,
weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, and estimates of terminal values. The Company believes the estimates used are reasonable and the significant effects of the BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
acquisition are properly reflected. </P>

seven years. The fair value of the license and distribution rights intangible assets as amortized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were estimated primarily using the &#147;income method,&#148; which starts with a forecast of all
expected future cash flows. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the development of intangible asset values, from the perspective of a market participant, include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (including net
revenue, cost of sales, commercial expenses, research and development costs and working capital requirements) as well as estimated contributory asset charges; the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; and the
assessment of the asset&#146;s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, among other factors. The license and distribution rights intangible assets will be amortized over ten years, which approximates the current, remaining patent
life of the BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> -related intellectual property. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result of the business
combination, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability of $16.0&nbsp;million. This deferred tax liability was netted against its deferred tax assets as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. Because a full valuation allowance has been provided against the
Company&#146;s deferred tax assets as it is considered more likely than not that they will not be utilized, the Company released a corresponding amount of its valuation allowance during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2017 and recognized a

December&nbsp;31, 2017, in accordance with its understanding of the 2017 Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and does not believe it will be material to its results of operations. The provisional amount related to the

<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On November&nbsp;2, 2010, Aquestive filed an action against the Company and its commercial partners for ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> in the Federal District Court of New Jersey (the DNJ) for alleged patent infringement and false marking. The Company was formally served in this matter on January&nbsp;19, 2011. Aquestive claimed
that the Company&#146;s manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which has never been disclosed publicly and which the Company and its partners maintain as a trade secret, infringes on its&#146;588
Patent. Of note, the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology itself was not at issue in the case, nor is BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> or BUNAVAIL<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, but rather only the manner in which ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which incorporates the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>
technology, is manufactured. Pursuant to its complaint, Aquestive was seeking an unspecified amount of damages, attorney&#146;s fees and an injunction preventing future infringement of Aquestive&#146;s patents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company strongly refuted as without merit Aquestive&#146;s assertion of patent infringement, which relates to the Company&#146;s
confidential, proprietary manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. On September&nbsp;12, 2011, the Company filed a request for inter partes reexamination in the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO) of Aquestive&#146;s &#146;588 Patent demonstrating that all claims of such patent were anticipated by or obvious in the light of prior art references, including several prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and
thus invalid. On September&nbsp;16, 2011, the Company filed a motion for stay pending the outcome of the reexamination proceedings, which subsequently was granted. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In November&nbsp;2011, the USPTO rejected all 191 claims of Aquestive&#146;s &#146;588 Patent. On January&nbsp;20, 2012, the Company filed
requests for reexamination before the USPTO of Aquestive&#146;s &#146;891 Patent, and&#146;292 Patent, the two additional patents asserted by Aquestive, demonstrating that all claims of those two patents were anticipated by or obvious in the light
of prior art references, including prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and thus invalid. The USPTO granted the requests for reexamination with respect to Aquestive&#146;s &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents. In its initial
office action in each, the USPTO rejected every claim in each patent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As expected, in the &#146;891 Patent and &#146;292 Patent Ex Parte
Reexamination proceedings, Aquestive amended the claims several times and made multiple declarations and arguments in an attempt to overcome the rejections made by the USPTO. These amendments, declarations and other statements regarding the claim
language significantly narrowed the scope of their claims in these two patents. In the case of the &#146;891 Patent, not one of the original claims survived reexamination and five separate amendments were filed confirming the Company&#146;s position
that the patent was invalid. Additionally, the Company believes that arguments and admissions made by Aquestive prevent it from seeking a broader construction during any subsequent litigation by employing arguments or taking positions that
contradict those made during prosecution. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A Reexamination Certificate for Aquestive&#146;s &#146;891 Patent in its amended form was issued

narrowing of the claims in the reissued patents strengthens the Company&#146;s original assertion that its products and technologies do not infringe on Aquestive&#146;s original patents. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On June&nbsp;12, 2013, despite the Company&#146;s previously noted success in the prior ex parte reexaminations for the &#146;292 and &#146;891
Patents, the Company filed requests for inter partes reviews (&#147;IPRs&#148;) on the narrowed yet reexamined patents, the &#146;292 C1 and &#146;891 C1 Patents, to challenge their validity and continue to strengthen its position. On
November&nbsp;13, 2013, the USPTO decided not to institute the two IPRs for the &#146;891 C1 and &#146;292 C1 Patents. The USPTO&#146;s decision was purely on statutory grounds and based on a technicality (in that the IPRs were not filed within what
the UPSTO determined to be the statutory period) rather than substantive grounds. Thus, even though the IPRs were not instituted, the USPTO decision preserves the Company rights to raise the same arguments at a later time (e.g., during litigation).
Regardless, the Company&#146;s assertion that its products and technologies do not infringe the original &#146;292 and &#146;891 Patents and, now, the reexamined &#146;891 C1 and &#146;292 C1 Patents remains the same. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Importantly, in the case of Aquestive&#146;s &#146;588 Patent, after the reexamination proceedings (and its appeals process), on April&nbsp;17,
2014, the PTAB issued a Decision on Appeal affirming the Examiner&#146;s rejection (and confirming the invalidity) of all the claims of the &#146;588 Patent. Aquestive did not request a rehearing by the May&nbsp;17, 2014 due date for making such a
request and did not further appeal the Decision to the Federal Court of Appeals by the June&nbsp;17, 2014 due date for making such an appeal. Subsequently, on August&nbsp;5, 2014, the USPTO issued a Certificate of Reexamination cancelling the
&#145;588 Patent claims. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on the Company&#146;s original assertion that its proprietary manufacturing process for ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> does not infringe on patents held by Aquestive, and the denial and subsequent narrowing of the claims on the two reissued patents Aquestive has asserted against us while the third has had all
claims rejected by the USPTO, the Company remains confident in its original stated position regarding this matter. Thus far, the Company has proven that the &#147;original&#148; &#146;292 and &#146;891 patents in light of their reissuance with fewer
and narrower claims were indeed invalid and the third and final patent, the &#146;588 patent, was invalid as well with all its claims cancelled. Given the outcomes of the &#145;292, &#145;891 and &#145;588 reexamination proceedings, at a
January&nbsp;22, 2015 status meeting, the Court decided to lift the stay and grant the Company&#146;s request for the case to proceed on an expedited basis with a Motion for Summary Judgment to dismiss the action. On September&nbsp;25, 2015, the
Company&#146;s motion for summary judgment was ordered and the case was subsequently closed. The Company was found to be entitled to absolute intervening rights as to both patents in suit, the &#145;292 and &#145;891 patents and its ONSOLIS<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product is not liable for infringing the patents prior to July&nbsp;3, 2012 and August&nbsp;21, 2012, respectively. In October 2015, Aquestive appealed the decision of the court to the Federal
Circuit. The Company had no reason to believe the outcome would be different and was prepared to vigorously defend the appeal. Aquestive, however, subsequently decided to withdraw the appeal.&nbsp;On February&nbsp;25, 2016, Aquestive filed an
Unopposed Motion For Voluntary Dismissal Of Appeal, which was granted by the court on February&nbsp;26, 2016 and the case dismissed.&nbsp;Thus, the district court&#146;s grant of the Summary Judgement of Intervening Rights stands. The possibility
exists that Aquestive could file another suit alleging infringement of the &#145;292 and &#146;891 patents. The Company continues to believe, however, that ONSOLIS<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and its other products
relying on the BEMA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> technology, including BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> and BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, do not
infringe any amended, reexamined claim from either patent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Litigation related to BUNAVAIL<SUP

against the Company relating to its BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina for alleged patent infringement. BUNAVAIL<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> is a drug approved for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. The RB Plaintiffs claim that the formulation for BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, which
has never been disclosed publicly, infringes its patent &#146;832 Patent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On May&nbsp;21, 2014, the Court granted the Company&#146;s
motion to dismiss. In doing so, the Court dismissed the case in its entirety. The RB Plaintiffs did not appeal the Court Decision by the June&nbsp;21, 2014 due date and therefore, the dismissal will stand and the RB Plaintiffs lose the ability to
challenge the Court Decision in the future. The possibility exists, however, that the RB Plaintiffs could file another suit alleging infringement of the &#145;832 Patent. If this occurs, based on the Company&#146;s original position that its
BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product does not infringe the &#145;832 Patent, the Company would defend the case vigorously (as the Company has done so previously), and the Company anticipates that such claims
against them ultimately would be rejected. </P>

January&nbsp;15, 2014 IPR was instituted and in June 2015, all challenged claims were rejected for both anticipation and obviousness. In August 2015, the RB Plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit affirmed the
USPTO&#146;s decision, and the RB Plaintiffs then filed a Petition for Panel Rehearing and for Rehearing En Banc, which was denied.&nbsp;A mandate issued on October&nbsp;25, 2016, pursuant to Rule 41(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure,
meaning that a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court is no longer possible for the RB Plaintiffs. The &#145;832 IPR was finally resolved with the invalidation of claims <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">15-19.</FONT> For the &#145;080 Patent,
all claims have been rejected in an <I>inter partes</I> reexamination and the rejection of all claims as invalid over the prior art has been affirmed on appeal by the PTAB in a decision dated March&nbsp;27, 2015. In May 2015, the RB Plaintiffs filed
a response after the decision to which the Company filed comments. In December 2015, the PTAB denied Aquestive&#146;s request to reopen prosecution, but provided Aquestive an opportunity to file a corrected response. Aquestive filed the request in
December 2015 and the Company subsequently filed comments on December&nbsp;23, 2015. The PTAB issued a communication on July&nbsp;7, 2016 denying Aquestive&#146;s request to reopen prosecution of the rejections of all claims over the prior
art.&nbsp;On January&nbsp;31, 2017, the PTAB issued a final decision maintaining an additional new ground of rejection in addition to the previous grounds of invalidity. As such, all claims remain finally rejected on multiple grounds. If a request
for rehearing is not filed within 30 days, the decision will become final as to the PTAB. Thereafter, if Aquestive does not appeal to the Federal Circuit, the decision will be final and all claims will be cancelled. For the &#145;378 Patent, an IPR
was filed on June&nbsp;1, 2014, but an IPR was not instituted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:9.5pt; font-family:Times New Roman">However, in issuing its November&nbsp;5, 2014 decision not to institute
the IPR, the PTAB construed the claims of the &#145;378 Patent narrowly. As in prior litigation proceedings, the Company believes these IPR and the reexamination filings will provide support for maintaining the stay until the IPR and reexamination
proceedings conclude. Indeed, given the PTAB&#146;s narrow construction of the claims of the &#145;378 Patent, the Company filed a motion to withdraw the &#145;378 Patent from the case on December&nbsp;12, 2014. In addition, the Company also filed a
joint motion to continue the stay (with RB Plaintiffs) in the proceedings on the same day. Both the motion to withdraw the &#145;378 Patent from the proceedings and motion to continue the stay were granted. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:9.5pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On September&nbsp;22, 2014, the RB Plaintiffs filed an action against the Company (and its commercial partner) relating to the Company&#146;s
BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for alleged patent infringement. The RB Plaintiffs claim that BUNAVAIL<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>, whose formulation and manufacturing processes have never been disclosed publicly, infringes its &#145;167 Patent. As with prior actions by the RB Plaintiffs, the Company believes this is another
anticompetitive attempt by the RB Plaintiffs to distract the Company&#146;s efforts from commercializing BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The Company strongly refutes as without merit the RB Plaintiffs&#146;
assertion of patent infringement and will vigorously defend the lawsuit. On December&nbsp;12, 2014, the Company filed a motion to transfer the case from New Jersey to North Carolina and a motion to dismiss the case against our commercial partner.
The Court issued an opinion on July&nbsp;21, 2015 granting the Company motion to transfer the venue to the&nbsp;Eastern District of North Carolina (&#147;ENDC&#148;) but denying its motion to dismiss the case against the Company&#146;s commercial
partner as moot. The Company has also filed a Joint Motion to Stay the case in North Carolina at the end of April 2016, which was granted by the court on May&nbsp;5, 2016. Thus, the case is now stayed until a final resolution of the &#145;167 IPRs
in the USPTO. The Company will continue to vigorously defend this case in the EDNC. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:9.5pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In a related matter, on October&nbsp;28, 2014, the
Company filed multiple IPR requests on the &#146;167 Patent demonstrating that certain claims of such patent were anticipated by or obvious in light of prior art references, including prior art references not previously considered by the USPTO, and
thus, invalid. The USPTO instituted three of the four IPR requests and we filed a request for rehearing for the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-instituted</FONT> IPR. The final decisions finding all claims patentable were issued in March 2016
and the Company filed a Request for Reconsideration in the USPTO in April 2016, which was denied in September 2016 and appealed to Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Fed. Cir.) in November 2016. The appeal is currently proceeding in the
Federal Circuit with final briefing completed August&nbsp;7, 2017 and oral argument held February&nbsp;7, 2018.&nbsp;The Company anticipates receiving a final decision from the Federal Circuit sometime in 2018. Regardless of the outcome of the
appeal, the Company believes that BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> will be found not to infringe the claims of the &#145;167 patent. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:9.5pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;22, 2014, Aquestive filed a Petition for IPR on US Patent No.&nbsp;7,579,019 (the &#145;019 Patent). The Petition asserted
that the claims of the &#145;019 Patent are alleged to be unpatentable over certain prior art references. The IPR was instituted on August&nbsp;6, 2014.&nbsp;An oral hearing was held in April 2015 and a decision upholding all seven claims was issued
August&nbsp;5, 2015. In September 2015, Aquestive requested that the PTAB rehear the IPR. On December&nbsp;19, 2016, the PTAB issued a final decision denying Aquestive&#146;s request for rehearing. Aquestive did not file a notice of appeal to the
Federal Circuit by February&nbsp;20, 2017, and therefore, the PTAB&#146;s decision upholding all claims of the Company&#146;s &#145;019 patent are final and unappealable. </P>

the District of New Jersey alleging BELBUCA<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> infringes the &#145;167 patent. In lieu of answering the complaint, the Company filed motions to dismiss the complaint and, in the alternative, to
transfer the case to the EDNC. Briefing on the motions was completed on June&nbsp;21, 2017. On July&nbsp;25, 2017, the Court administratively terminated the case pending the parties submission of a joint stipulation of transfer because the District
of New Jersey was an inappropriate venue. This case has been transferred to Delaware District Court. On October&nbsp;31, 2017 the Company filed motions to dismiss the complaint and, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the EDNC.&nbsp;Briefing
on the motions was completed on December&nbsp;1, 2017.&nbsp;The Company anticipates receiving a final decision from the District Court in the 2nd quarter of 2018.&nbsp;The Company strongly refutes as without merit Aquestive&#146;s assertion of
patent infringement and will vigorously defend the lawsuit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:16pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Teva Pharmaceuticals (formerly Actavis) </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On February&nbsp;8, 2016, the Company received a notice relating to a Paragraph IV certification from Teva Pharmaceuticals (&#147;Teva&#148;)
(formerly Actavis Laboratories UT, Inc.) seeking to find invalid three Orange Book listed patents (the &#147;Patents&#148;) relating specifically to BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The Paragraph IV certification
relates to an Abbreviated New Drug Application (the <B></B>&#147;ANDA&#148;) filed by Actavis with the FDA for a generic formulation of BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The Patents subject to Teva&#146;s
certification are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,579,019 (&#147;the &#146;019 Patent&#148;), the &#146;866 Patent and the &#146;177 Patent. Under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984,
as amended (the &#147;Hatch-Waxman Amendments&#148;), after receipt of a valid Paragraph IV notice, the Company may, and in this case did, bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court against Teva within 45&nbsp;days from the date of
receipt of the certification notice. On March&nbsp;18, 2016, the Company filed a complaint in Delaware against Teva, thus the Company is entitled to receive a 30 month stay on the FDA&#146;s ability to give final approval to any proposed products
that reference BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay is expected to preempt any final approval by the FDA on Teva&#146;s ANDA until at least August of 2018. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company has asserted three different patents against Teva, the &#146;019 patent, the &#145;866 patent, and the &#146;177 patent.&nbsp;Teva
did not raise <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-infringement</FONT> positions with regard to the &#146;019 and the &#146;866 patents in its Paragraph IV certification.&nbsp;Teva did raise a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-infringement</FONT>
position on the &#146;177 patent due to its assertion that the backing layer for its generic product does not have a pH within the claimed range claimed in the patent.&nbsp;The Company asserted in its complaint that Teva infringed the &#145;177
patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Company believes that Teva is unlikely to prevail on its claims that the
&#146;019, &#146;866, and &#146;177 Patents are invalid, and, as the Company has done in the past, intends to vigorously defend its intellectual property. Each of the three patents carry the presumption of validity and, the &#145;019 Patent has
already been the subject of an unrelated IPR before the USPTO under which the Company, and all claims of the &#145;019 Patent survived. Aquestive&#146;s request for rehearing of the final IPR decision regarding the &#145;019 Patent was denied by the
USPTO on December&nbsp;19, 2016. Aquestive did not file a timely appeal at the Federal Circuit. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On December&nbsp;20, 2016 the USPTO issued
U.S. Patent No.&nbsp;9,522,188 (&#147;the &#146;188 patent&#148;), and this patent was properly listed in the Orange Book as covering the BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> product. On February&nbsp;23, 2017 Teva sent
a Paragraph IV certification adding the 9,522,188 to its ANDA. An amended Complaint will be filed, adding the &#146;188 patent to the current litigation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:4pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">On January&nbsp;31, 2017, the Company received a notice relating to a Paragraph IV certification from Teva relating to Teva&#146;s ANDA on
additional strengths of BUNAVAIL<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. On March&nbsp;16, 2017, the Company brought suit against Teva and its parent company on these additional strengths within 45 days from the receipt of the
notice in Delaware. As in the original case brought by Actavis, the Company is again entitled to receive a 30 month stay on the FDA&#146;s ability to give final approval to any proposed products that reference the additional strengths of BUNAVAIL<SUP
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP>. The <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-month</FONT> stay is expected to extend until at least August of 2019. On June&nbsp;20, 2017, the Court entered orders staying both BUNAVAIL<SUP
