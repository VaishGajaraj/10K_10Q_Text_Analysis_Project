                                     PART I

     The terms "we," "our," "us" and "Atmos" refer to Atmos Energy Corporation
and its subsidiaries, unless the context suggests otherwise. The abbreviations
"Mcf," "MMcf" and "Bcf" mean thousand cubic feet, million cubic feet and billion
cubic feet.

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

OPERATIONS

     We distribute and sell natural gas to approximately 1.4 million
residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural and other customers. We
operate through five divisions in service areas located in Colorado, Georgia,
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas and
Virginia. In addition, we transport natural gas for others through our
distribution system.

     We provide natural gas storage services and own or hold an interest in
natural gas storage fields in Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana to supplement
natural gas used by customers in Kansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana and
other states. We also provide energy management and gas marketing services to
industrial customers, municipalities and other local distribution companies. We
also provide electrical power generation to meet peak load demands for a
municipality regulated by the Tennessee Valley Authority. In addition, we market
natural gas to industrial and agricultural customers primarily in West Texas and
to industrial customers in Louisiana.

FORMATION

     We were organized under the laws of Texas in 1983 as Energas Company, a
subsidiary of Pioneer Corporation, for the purposes of owning and operating
Pioneer's natural gas distribution business in Texas. Immediately following the
transfer by Pioneer to Atmos of its gas distribution business, which Pioneer and
its predecessors had operated since 1906, Pioneer distributed our outstanding
stock to its shareholders. In September 1988, we changed our name from Energas
Company to Atmos Energy Corporation. As a result of the merger with United
Cities Gas Company in July 1997, we also became incorporated in Virginia.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     Completion of acquisition of remaining equity interest in Woodward
Marketing.  We acquired a 45 percent interest in Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. in
1997 as a result of the merger of Atmos and United Cities Gas Company, which had
acquired that interest in 1995. In April 2001, we acquired the 55 percent
interest in Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. that we did not already own in exchange
for 1,423,193 restricted shares of our common stock. The consideration is
subject to an upward adjustment, based on our share price, of up to 232,547
shares plus an amount of shares to compensate for dividends paid after the
completion of the acquisition. As a result of the completion of the acquisition,
the guaranty by one of our subsidiaries of Woodward Marketing's $140.0 million
short-term working capital and letter of credit facility increased from 45
percent to 100 percent of any amounts outstanding. Under the facility, as of
September 30, 2001, $28.0 million was outstanding, and letters of credit
totaling $38.8 million had been issued. Since April 1, 2001, our subsidiary has
been the sole guarantor of all payables, up to $40.0 million, of Woodward
Marketing for natural gas purchases and transportation services.

     Completion of acquisition of natural gas operations in Louisiana.  In July
2001, we acquired from Citizens Communications Company the natural gas
operations of its Louisiana Gas Service Company division and its subsidiary LGS
Natural Gas Company for $363.4 million in cash. Upon completion of the
acquisition, we became the largest natural gas distributor in Louisiana, and our
national customer base increased to about 1.4 million customers, making us the
fifth largest pure natural gas local distribution company in the United States.

     The acquired operations provide natural gas distribution service to
approximately 279,000 residential and commercial meters in communities in
southeastern and northern Louisiana. The service territory includes the suburban
areas of metropolitan New Orleans (excluding Orleans Parish), the north shore of
Lake Pontchar-

                                        1
<PAGE>

train and the Monroe/West Monroe metropolitan area. The unregulated operations,
which include an intrastate pipeline company, provides gas transportation
service to industrial customers and to the acquired operations.

     Pending acquisition of Mississippi Valley Gas Company.  In September 2001,
we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mississippi Valley Gas
Company, a privately held natural gas utility, for $75.0 million cash, $75.0
million of Atmos common stock and the assumption of approximately $45.0 million
of long-term debt. Mississippi Valley Gas provides natural gas distribution
service to more than 261,500 residential, commercial, industrial and other
customers located primarily in the northern and central regions of Mississippi.
Mississippi Valley Gas has a 5,500 mile distribution system and 335 miles of
intrastate pipeline. It also has two underground storage facilities with 2.05
Bcf of working gas capacity. The acquisition is subject to state and federal
regulatory approval. It is anticipated that the acquisition will be completed in
fiscal 2002.

     Atmos Power Systems, Inc. constructs power plant.  In May 2001, our
subsidiary, Atmos Power Systems, Inc., entered into a definitive agreement with
the City of Bolivar, Tennessee Electric Department to construct a 20-megawatt
electric generating plant and associated facilities. Atmos Power Systems leased
the peaking plant to the Electric Department of the City of Bolivar for 10
years, with an option for Bolivar to purchase the plant beginning in the fifth
year of the lease. Because of the success of this first project, Atmos is
considering other opportunities to build and lease power plants. Although
results to date have not been material, we anticipate growth in this type of
business.

     Acquisition of Southern Resources, IGS and Kentucky storage
assets.  Woodward Marketing completed the purchases of Southern Resources, Inc.
and certain assets of Innovative Gas Services, Incorporated in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2001 thereby expanding our gas marketing operations. We
expect to complete the acquisition of certain storage assets in Kentucky in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2002. The acquisition will enable us to provide
additional gas storage capacity. Total cost of the acquisitions is approximately
$16.0 million in cash.

STRATEGY

     Our overall strategy is to:

     - deliver superior shareholder value,

     - continue to manage our utility operations efficiently,

     - profitably grow our non-utility operations to complement our utility
       operations, and

     - profitably grow our business through acquisitions.

     We are running our operations efficiently by:

     - managing our operating and maintenance expenses,

     - leveraging our technology, such as our 24 hour call center, to achieve
       more efficient operations,

     - focusing on regulatory rate proceedings to increase revenue,

     - mitigating weather-related risks through weather normalized rates in some
       jurisdictions and purchasing weather insurance in others, and

     - disposing of non-growth assets.

     We are growing our non-utility operations by:

     - completing the purchase of the remaining interest in Woodward Marketing,

     - increasing our non-regulated gas sales, and

     - entering into new non-utility businesses, such as distributed electrical
       power generation.

                                        2
<PAGE>

     We are growing our utility business by acquiring natural gas operations,
such as Louisiana Gas Service Company and LGS Natural Gas Company in July 2001
and the pending acquisition of Mississippi Valley Gas Company.

     Our operations are divided into two segments, a utility operations segment,
which includes our natural gas distribution and sales operations, and our
non-regulated segment, which includes all of our other operations.

UTILITY OPERATIONS SEGMENT OVERVIEW

     Our utility operations segment is operated through our five regulated
natural gas divisions:

     - Atmos Energy Louisiana Gas Company,

     - Energas Company,

     - Greeley Gas Company,

     - United Cities Gas Company, and

     - Western Kentucky Gas Company

     Atmos Energy Louisiana.  Our Atmos Energy Louisiana Gas division includes
the operations of the assets of Louisiana Gas Service Company acquired in July
2001 and our previously existing Trans Louisiana Gas division. Our Atmos Energy
Louisiana Gas division operates in Louisiana and is regulated by the Louisiana
Public Service Commission, which regulates utility services, rates and other
matters. In most of the areas in which we operate in Louisiana, we do so
pursuant to a non-exclusive franchise granted by the governing authority of each
area. Direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in Louisiana, who use
gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes, and sales of natural gas for vehicle
fuel are exempt from regulation.

     In connection with its review of our acquisition of Louisiana Gas Service,
the Louisiana Public Service Commission has approved a rate structure that
requires us to share any cost savings that result from the acquisition with the
customers of Louisiana Gas Service. The shared cost savings will be the
difference between operation and maintenance expense in any future year and the
1998 normalized expense for Louisiana Gas Service, indexed for inflation, annual
changes in labor costs and customer growth. The customers are not assured any
savings in 2001. In 2002 and in future years, the customers are assured annual
savings, which will be indexed for inflation, annual changes in labor costs and
customer growth. The sharing mechanism will remain in place for 20 years subject
to established modification procedures.

     The rates of Louisiana Gas Service are subject to a purchased gas
adjustment clause that allows it to pass changes in gas costs on to its
customers. In addition, on January 29, 2001, the Louisiana Public Service
Commission approved a rate stabilization clause for Louisiana Gas Service for a
three-year period beginning January 1, 2001. Under the rate stabilization
clause, Louisiana Gas Service will be allowed to earn a return on equity within
certain ranges that will be monitored on an annual basis. After the completion
of the acquisition of Louisiana Gas Service, our Atmos Energy Louisiana division
also became subject to the adjustment and stabilization clause.

     Louisiana Gas Service is currently involved in a proceeding with the
Louisiana Public Service Commission relating to past costs associated with the
purchase of gas that it charged to its customers. Although, after completion of
the acquisition, we took over the defense of this proceeding and will have
responsibility for any finding of liability on the part of Louisiana Gas
Service, we believe the outcome of this proceeding will not have a material
adverse impact on our operations as Citizens has agreed to fully indemnify us
for any liability as a result of this proceeding.

     The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved a Rate Stabilization
Clause for three years for our former Trans La Division with an allowed return
on common equity between 10.5 percent and 11.5 percent. This decision increased
the service charge amounts from about 20 percent to about 70 percent of actual
costs and increased the monthly customer charges from $6 to $9, both effective
November 1, 1999.

                                        3
<PAGE>


     At and for the year ended September 30, 2001, we had 368,436 utility meters
in service in Louisiana and total throughput of 12,578 MMcf. At and for the year
ended September 30, 2000, we had 81,419 meters in service and total throughput
of 7,448 MMcf.


     Energas.  Our Energas division operates in Texas. The governing body of
each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all utility rates,
operations and services within its city limits, except with respect to sales of
natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use. We operate pursuant to
non-exclusive franchises granted by the municipalities we serve, which are
subject to renewal from time to time. The Railroad Commission of Texas has
exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and
ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates
and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality. The
Railroad Commission is currently conducting a gas cost audit of all local
distribution companies in Texas, including Energas, in response to the high gas
costs this past winter. At and for the year ended September 30, 2001, we had
314,734 utility meters in service and total throughput of 53,586 MMcf. At and
for the year ended September 30, 2000, we had 302,662 utility meters in service
and total throughput of 53,922 MMcf.

     Greeley Gas.  Our Greeley Gas division operates in Colorado, Kansas and
Missouri and is regulated by the respective states' public service commission
with respect to accounting, rates and charges, operating matters and the
issuance of securities. We operate under terms of non-exclusive franchises
granted by the various cities. At and for the year ended September 30, 2001,
Greeley had 212,484 utility meters in service and total throughput of 37,797
MMcf. At and for the year ended September 30, 2000, Greeley had 207,161 meters
in service and total throughput of 34,455 MMcf.

     United Cities.  Our United Cities Gas division operates in Georgia,
Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Tennessee and Virginia. In each of these states, our
rates, services and operations as a natural gas distribution company are subject
to general regulation by each state's public service commission. We operate in
each community, where necessary, under a franchise granted by the municipality
for a fixed term of years. In Tennessee and Georgia, we have performance based
rates, which provide incentives for us to find ways to lower costs. Any cost
savings are then shared with our customers. We also have weather normalization
adjustments to our rates in Tennessee and Georgia. At and for the year ended
September 30, 2001, United Cities had 308,394 utility meters in service and
total throughput of 64,924 MMcf. At and for the year ended September 30, 2000,
United Cities had 312,018 meters in service and total throughput of 56,698 MMcf.

     Western Kentucky Gas.  Our Western Kentucky Gas division operates in
Kentucky and is regulated by the Kentucky Public Service Commission, which
regulates utility services, rates, issuance of securities and other matters. We
operate in the various incorporated cities pursuant to non-exclusive franchises
granted to us by these cities. Sales of natural gas for use as vehicle fuel in
Kentucky are unregulated. We have been operating under a performance based rate
program since July 1998. We also have weather normalization adjustments to our
rates in Kentucky. At and for the year ended September 30, 2001, Western
Kentucky Gas had 182,275 utility meters in service and total throughput of
46,530 MMcf. At and for the year ended September 30, 2000, Western Kentucky Gas
had 181,066 meters in service and total throughput of 47,129 MMcf.

NON-REGULATED SEGMENT OVERVIEW

     Our non-regulated segment is primarily composed of the following three
parts:

     - Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC.  Atmos Energy Marketing provides a variety
       of natural gas management services to natural gas utility systems and
       industrial natural gas consumers in several states and to our Atmos
       Energy Louisiana Gas, Greeley Gas, United Cities Gas and Western Kentucky
       Gas divisions. These services consist primarily of acquisition and
       provision of natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based prices, load
       forecasting and management, gas storage and transportation services,
       peaking sales and balancing services and gas price hedging through the
       use of derivative products. Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. is a wholly owned
       subsidiary of Atmos Energy Marketing.

                                        4
<PAGE>

     - Atmos Pipeline and Storage, L.L.C.  Atmos Pipeline and Storage owns or
       has an interest in underground storage fields in Kansas, Kentucky and
       Louisiana and provides storage services to our United Cities Gas, Greeley
       Gas and Atmos Energy Louisiana Gas divisions and other non-regulated
       customers.

     - Atmos Power Systems, Inc.  Atmos Power Systems constructs and operates
       electrical power generating plants and associated facilities. Atmos Power
       Systems may also enter into agreements to either lease or sell such
       plants.

WOODWARD MARKETING ACTIVITIES

     We acquired a 45 percent interest in Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. in 1997 as
a result of the merger of Atmos and United Cities Gas Company, which had
acquired that interest in 1995. In April 2001, we acquired the 55 percent
interest that we did not own from J.D. Woodward and others for 1,423,193
restricted shares of our common stock. Immediately following the acquisition,
Mr. Woodward was elected as a Senior Vice President of Atmos in charge of all
non-regulated business activities, a position he has held since April 2001.
Prior to that time, Mr. Woodward had not been an officer or employee of Atmos.

     The principal business of Woodward Marketing, including the activities of
Trans Louisiana Industrial Gas Company, Inc., is the overall management of
natural gas requirements for municipalities, local gas utility companies and
industrial customers located primarily in the Southwestern and Midwestern United
States. This business involves the sale of natural gas by Woodward Marketing to
its customers and the management of storage and transportation contracts for its
customers under contracts generally having one to two-year terms. At September
30, 2001, Woodward Marketing had a total of 78 municipal and local gas utility
customers and 195 industrial customers. Woodward Marketing also sells natural
gas to certain of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under
contract terms from 30 days to two years. In addition, Woodward Marketing
supplies us with a portion of our natural gas requirements on a competitive bid
basis.

     In the management of natural gas requirements for municipal and other local
utilities, Woodward Marketing sells physical natural gas for future delivery and
hedges the associated price risk through the use of gas futures, including
forwards, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options, and swap contracts with
counterparties. These financial contracts are marked-to-market at the daily
close of business. Woodward Marketing links gas futures to physical delivery of
natural gas and balances its futures positions at the end of each trading day.
Over-the-counter swap agreements require Woodward Marketing to receive or make
payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price of
natural gas on the settlement date. Woodward Marketing uses these futures and
swaps to manage margins on offsetting fixed-price purchase or sale commitments
for physical quantities of natural gas, which are also carried on a mark to
market basis. Options held to hedge price risk provide the right, but not the
requirement, to buy or sell energy commodities at a fixed price. Woodward
Marketing uses options to manage margins and to limit overall price risk
exposure.

     Energy related services provided by Woodward Marketing include the sale of
natural gas to its various customer classes and management of transportation and
storage assets and inventories. More specifically, energy services include
contract negotiation and administration, load forecasting, storage acquisition,
natural gas purchase and delivery and capacity utilization strategies. In
providing these services, Woodward Marketing generates income from its utility,
municipal and industrial customers through negotiated prices based on the volume
of gas supplied to the customer. Woodward Marketing also generates income by
taking advantage of the difference between near-term gas prices and prices for
future delivery as well as the daily movement of gas prices by utilizing storage
and transportation capacity that it controls.

     Woodward Marketing also engages in limited speculative natural gas trading
for its own account, subject to a risk management policy established by us which
limits the level of trading loss in any fiscal year to a maximum of 25 percent
of the budgeted annual operating income of Woodward Marketing. Compliance with
such risk management policy is monitored on a daily basis. In addition, Woodward
Marketing's bank credit facility limits trading positions that are not closed at
the end of the day (open positions) to 2.5 Bcf of natural gas. At September 30,
2001, Woodward Marketing's open positions in its trading operations totaled 2.3
Bcf. In its speculative trading, Woodward Marketing's open trading positions are
monitored on a daily basis but are
                                        5
<PAGE>

not required to be closed if they remain within the limits set by the bank loan
agreement. Woodward Marketing had an unrealized trading gain of $4.5 million for
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, but there can be no assurance that
Woodward Marketing will have any speculative trading gain in the future. In some
prior years, Woodward Marketing has experienced losses in its speculative
trading business. The financial exposure that results from the daily
fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements
constitutes a risk of loss since the price of natural gas purchased for future
delivery at the beginning of the day may not be hedged until later in the day.

     Financial instruments, which subject Woodward Marketing to counterparty
risk, consist primarily of financial instruments arising from trading and risk
management activities and overnight repurchase agreements that are not insured.
Counterparty risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by financial
counterparties to a contract. Exchange-traded future and option contracts are
generally guaranteed by the exchanges.

     Woodward Marketing's operations are concentrated in the natural gas
industry, and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks
affecting that industry.

Notes to preceding tables:
---------------

(1) Prior to August 2000, propane revenues and expenses were fully consolidated.
    Subsequent to August 2000, the results of propane are shown on the equity
    basis.

(2) A heating degree day is equivalent to each degree that the average of the
    high and the low temperatures for a day is below 65 degrees. The colder the
    climate, the greater the number of heating degree days. Heating degree days
    are used in the natural gas industry to measure the relative coldness of
    weather experienced and to compare relative temperatures between one
    geographic area and another. Normal degree days are based on 30-year average
    National Weather Service data for selected locations. Degree day information
    for 2001 and 2000 are presented excluding service areas with weather
    normalized operations. Degree day information for 1999, 1998 and 1997 does
    not exclude service areas with weather normalized operations as that
    information was not available.

(3) These tables present data for our five utility business units. Their
    operations include the regulated local distribution companies located in
    their respective service areas. The operations of Louisiana Gas are included
    in Atmos Energy Louisiana since July 1, 2001, the date of acquisition.

(4) Utility sales volumes and revenues reflect utility segment operations,
    including intercompany sales and transportation amounts.

(5) The number of employees excludes 480 and 369 Atmos shared services and
    customer support center employees and 62 and 28 non-utility employees in
    2001 and 2000.

SEGMENT OVERVIEW

     We consider each business unit within our utility segment to be a reporting
unit of the utility segment and not a reportable segment. Our chief executive
officer makes decisions about allocating resources to the utility segment as a
whole and not to individual reporting units.

     The following table summarizes certain information regarding the operations
of the utility and non-regulated segments of Atmos as of and for each of the
three years ended September 30, 2001. The information is net of intersegment
eliminations.

"Non-Regulated Segment Overview".

GAS SALES

     Our natural gas distribution business is seasonal and highly dependent on
weather conditions in our service areas. Gas sales to residential and commercial
customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the
year. The volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the
temperatures during these months. The seasonal nature of our sales to
residential and commercial customers is

                                        10
<PAGE>

partially offset by our sales in the spring and summer months to our
agricultural customers in Texas, Colorado and Kansas who use natural gas to
operate irrigation equipment.

     In addition to weather, our revenues are affected by the cost of natural
gas and economic conditions in the areas that we serve. Higher gas costs, which
we are generally able to pass through to our customers under purchased gas
adjustment clauses, may cause customers to conserve, or, in the case of
industrial customers, to use alternative energy sources.

     To protect against volatility in gas prices, we are hedging gas costs for
the 2001-2002 heating season by utilizing a combination of financial tools and
fixed forward physical contracts to stabilize gas prices. For the 2001-2002
heating season, we plan to cover approximately 64 percent of our anticipated
requirements through storage and hedging instruments. The gas hedges should help
moderate the effects of higher customer accounts receivable caused by higher gas
prices.

     We also have weather normalization adjustments in our rate jurisdictions in
Tennessee, Georgia and Kentucky. We purchased weather hedges for our Texas and
Louisiana operations effective for the 2000-2001 heating season. We also
purchased a three-year weather insurance policy for our Texas and Louisiana
operations commencing with the 2001-2002 heating season, with an option to
cancel in the third year. The policy covers the entire heating season of October
to March. See "Weather and seasonality" in Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Operations.

     Our distribution systems have experienced aggregate peak day deliveries of
approximately 2.0 Bcf per day. We have the ability to curtail deliveries to
certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts and applicable
state statutes or regulations which enable us to maintain our deliveries to high
priority customers. We have not imposed curtailment in our Energas Division
since we began independent operations in 1983 or in our Atmos Energy Louisiana
Gas Division since we acquired Trans Louisiana Gas Company in 1986 and Louisiana
Gas Service in 2001. The Western Kentucky Gas Division curtailed deliveries to
certain interruptible customers during exceptionally cold periods in December
1989, January 1994 and during the winter of 1996. Neither the Greeley Gas
Division nor its predecessor, Greeley Gas Company, has curtailed deliveries to
its sales customers since prior to 1980. The United Cities Gas Division curtails
interruptible service customers from time to time each year in accordance with
the interruptible contracts and tariffs.

GAS SUPPLY

     We receive gas deliveries through 35 pipeline transportation companies,
both interstate and intrastate, to satisfy our sales market requirements. The
pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have pipeline
no-notice storage service which provides for daily balancing between system
requirements and nominated flowing supplies. These agreements have been
negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of
first refusal.

     The Western Kentucky Gas Division's gas supply is delivered primarily by
the following pipelines: Williams Pipeline-Texas Gas, Tennessee Gas, Trunkline,
Midwestern Pipeline and ANR. During 1998, the Western Kentucky Gas Division
sought and was granted approval by the Kentucky Public Service Commission for a
performance-based rate program which commenced in July 1998. Under the
performance-based program, we and our customers jointly share in any actual gas
cost savings achieved when compared to pre-determined benchmarks. We also have
similar gas cost performance-based rate mechanisms in Georgia and Tennessee.

     The United Cities Gas Division is served by 13 interstate pipelines. The
majority of the volumes are transported through East Tennessee Pipeline,
Southern Natural Gas, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Columbia Gulf.

     Colorado Interstate Gas Company, Williams Pipeline-Central, Public Service
Company of Colorado and Northwest Pipeline are the principal transporters of the
Greeley Gas Division's requirements. Additionally, the Greeley Gas Division
purchases substantial volumes from producers that are connected directly to its
distribution system.

                                        11
<PAGE>

     The Energas Division receives sales and transportation service from various
ONEOK pipeline affiliates. Also, the Energas Division purchases a significant
portion of its supply from Pioneer Natural Resources which is connected directly
to our Amarillo, Texas distribution system.

     Louisiana Intrastate Gas Company, Acadian Pipeline, Gulf South and Williams
Pipeline-Texas Gas pipelines deliver most of the Atmos Energy Louisiana Gas
Division's requirements.

     We also own or hold an interest in and operate numerous natural gas storage
facilities in Kentucky, Kansas and Louisiana which are used to help meet
customer requirements during peak demand periods and to reduce the need to
contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet such peak demand periods.
Additionally, we operate one propane plant and a liquified natural gas plant for
peak shaving purposes. We also contract for storage service in underground
storage facilities on many of the interstate pipelines serving us. See "Item 2.
Properties" below for further information regarding the peak shaving facilities.

     We normally inject gas into pipeline storage systems and company owned
storage facilities during the summer months and withdraw it in the winter
months. Our underground storage facilities in Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana
have a combined maximum daily output capability of approximately 226,000 Mcf.

     We purchase our gas supply from various producers and marketers. Supply
arrangements are contracted on a firm basis with various terms at market prices.
The firm supply consists of both base load and swing supply quantities. Base
load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and
swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to
match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions.
Except for local production purchases, we select suppliers through a competitive
bidding process by sending out a request for proposal to suppliers that have
demonstrated that they can provide reliable service. We select these suppliers
based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline
receipt points and the best cost. Major suppliers during fiscal 2001 were
Reliant Energy, Sonat Marketing, Cinergy, Pioneer Natural Resources, Texaco,
Woodward Marketing, ONEOK Gas Marketing, Aquila, BP Energy, Enron, Enbridge,
Anadarko and Tenaska Marketing. We do not anticipate problems with securing
additional gas supply as needed for our customers.

REGULATION

     Each of our utility divisions is regulated by various state or local public
utility authorities. We are also subject to regulation by the United States
Department of Transportation with respect to safety requirements in the
operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities. Our distribution
operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating
environmental matters. From time to time we receive inquiries regarding various
environmental matters. We believe that our properties and operations
substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with
applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations. There are no
administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality
statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which
would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations.

RATES

     The method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which
we operate. The regulators have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities
under their jurisdiction operate in the best interests of customers while
providing the utilities the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on
investment. In a general rate case, the applicable regulatory authority, which
is typically the state public utility commission, establishes a base margin,
which is the amount of revenue authorized to be collected from customers to
recover authorized operating expense (other than the cost of gas), depreciation,
interest, taxes and return on rate base. The divisions in our utility operations
segment perform annual deficiency studies for each rate jurisdiction to
determine when to file rate cases, which are typically filed every two to five
years.

     Substantially all of the sales charged by us to our customers fluctuate
with the cost of gas purchased by us. Rates established by regulatory
authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost
through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas adjustment mechanisms
provide gas

                                        12
<PAGE>

utilities a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without
the necessity of a rate case addressing all of the utilities' non-gas costs.
These mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a
particular type of expense, such as purchased gas costs, that (i) is subject to
significant price fluctuations compared to the utility's other costs, (ii)
represents a large component of the utility's cost of service and (iii) is
generally outside the control of the gas utility. Such purchased gas adjustment
mechanisms are not designed to allow the utility to earn a profit but are
designed to allow a dollar-for-dollar recovery of fuel costs. Therefore, while
our operating revenues may fluctuate, gross profit (which is defined as
operating revenues less purchased gas cost) is generally not eroded or enhanced
because of gas cost increases or decreases.

     Approximately 96 percent of our revenues in the fiscal year ended September
30, 2001, and approximately 87 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2000 were
derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state
authorities. Generally, the regulatory authority reviews our rate request and
establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover
our costs of doing business and provide a reasonable return on invested capital.

     The following table sets forth major rate requests made by us or other
parties during the most recent five years and the action taken on such requests:

COMPETITION

     We are not currently in significant direct competition with any other
distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our
service areas. However, we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and
suppliers of alternate fuels for sales to industrial and agricultural customers.
We compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources,
including, in particular, electricity. Competition for residential and
commercial customers is increasing. Promotional incentives, improved equipment
efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of
electrical equipment. Electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy
source and compete for the space heating, water heating and cooking markets. The
principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and
natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential,
commercial and industrial markets. In addition, through Atmos Energy Marketing,
we compete with other natural gas brokers in obtaining natural gas supplies for
customers.

EMPLOYEES


     At September 30, 2001, we had 2,361 employees. See "Utility Sales and
Statistical Data by Business Unit" for the number of employees by business unit.


ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     We own an aggregate of 38,938 miles of underground distribution and
transmission mains throughout our gas distribution systems. These mains are
located on easements or rights-of-way which generally provide for perpetual use.
We maintain our mains through a program of continuous inspection and repair and
believe that our system of mains is in good condition. We also own and operate
one propane peak shaving plant with a total capacity of approximately 180,000
gallons that can produce an equivalent of approximately 3,300 Mcf daily. We also
own a liquefied natural gas storage facility with a capacity of 500,000 Mcf
which can inject a daily volume of 30,000 Mcf into the system, as well as
underground storage fields, as discussed below, that are used to supplement the
supply of natural gas in periods of peak demand.


     We have six underground gas storage facilities in Kentucky and four in
Kansas. We own a 25 percent interest in a gas storage facility in Napoleonville,
Louisiana. This gas storage facility is operated by Acadian Gas Pipeline System
who also owns the remaining 75 percent interest. Our 25 percent usable capacity
is 364,782 Mcf. In addition to the usable capacity we maintain 332,917 Mcf of
cushion gas to maintain reservoir pressure. The Napoleonville facility has a
maximum daily delivery capability of approximately 56,000 Mcf. We also have a
contract through March 2003 with Bridgeline Gas Distribution LLC for 250,000 Mcf
of usable storage capacity in a storage facility in Sorrento, Louisiana. The
Sorrento facility has a maximum daily delivery capability of approximately
25,000 Mcf.


     Our total storage capacity is approximately 21.9 Bcf. However,
approximately 10.3 Bcf of gas in the storage facilities must be retained as
cushion gas to maintain reservoir pressure. The maximum daily delivery
capability of these storage facilities is approximately 226,000 Mcf.


     Substantially all of our properties in our Greeley Gas Division and United
Cities Gas Division with net book values of approximately $174.4 million and
$314.1 million are subject to liens under First Mortgage Bonds assumed in our
mergers with Greeley Gas Company and United Cities Gas Company. At September 30,
2001, the liens collateralized $17.0 million of outstanding 9.4 percent Series J
First Mortgage Bonds due May 1, 2021, and $92.2 million of outstanding Series P,
Q, R, T, U and V First Mortgage Bonds due at various dates from 2004 through
2022.


     Our administrative offices are consolidated in Dallas, Texas under one
lease. We also maintain field offices throughout our distribution system, the
majority of which are located in leased premises.


     Net property, plant and equipment at September 30, 2001 included
approximately $1,280.6 million for utility and $54.8 million for non-regulated.


                                        14

     We hold franchises granted by the incorporated cities and towns that we
serve. At September 30, 2001, we held 544 such franchises having terms generally
ranging from five to 25 years. We believe that each of our franchises will be
renewed.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     See Note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE HARBOR UNDER THE PRIVATE
SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

     The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact
included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by the
Company and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability
established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used
in this Report, or any other of the Company's documents or oral presentations,
the words "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "plans," "believes," "objective,"
"forecast," "goal" or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed or implied in the statements relating to the Company's strategy,
operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas
supply and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following:
adverse weather conditions such as warmer than normal weather in the Company's
service territories; national, regional and local economic conditions, including
competition from other energy suppliers as well as alternative forms of energy;
recent national events; regulatory approvals, including the impact of rate
proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; successful completion
and integration of pending acquisition; inflation and increased gas costs,
including their effect on commodity prices for natural gas; increased
competition; further deregulation or "unbundling" of the natural gas
distribution industry; hedging and market risk activities and other
uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are
beyond the control of the Company. Accordingly, while the Company believes these
forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they
will approximate actual experience or that the

                                        17

expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, the Company undertakes
no obligation to update or revise any of its forward-looking statements whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

RATEMAKING ACTIVITY

     The following is a discussion of our ratemaking activity for rate cases
that are currently pending as of September 30, 2001 or rate proceedings
completed during the three years ended September 30, 2001.

     Results of our rate activity for the three years ended September 30, 2001
can be summarized as follows: net annual rate increases totaling $6.4 million
implemented in 2001, annual rate increases totaling $12.1 million implemented in
2000 and no rate changes in 1999.

     In August 1999, the Energas Division filed rate cases in its West Texas
System cities and Amarillo, Texas, requesting rate increases of approximately
$9.8 million and $4.4 million. The Energas Division received an increase in
annual revenues of approximately $2.1 million in base rates plus an increase of
$.1 million in service charges in Amarillo, Texas, effective for bills rendered
on or after January 1, 2000. The agreement with Amarillo also provided for
changes in the rate structure to reduce the impact of warmer than normal weather
and to improve the recovery of the actual cost of service calls. The Energas
Division's request for an annual increase of approximately $9.8 million from the
67 cities served by its West Texas System was denied. In March 2000, this
decision was appealed to the Railroad Commission of Texas. Subsequently, 59
cities representing approximately 58 percent of Energas' customers ratified a
non-binding Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement capped the rate
increase at $3.0 million and entitled the ratifying cities to accept a rate
increase below $3.0 million in the event the Railroad Commission adopted a
lesser increase for the non-ratifying cities. Eight cities declined to
participate in the settlement and a hearing with the Railroad Commission was
held in August 2000. In December 2000, the Railroad Commission approved an
increase in annual revenues of approximately $3.0 million effective December 1,
2000. In addition, the Railroad Commission approved a new rate design providing
more protection from warmer than normal weather for our West Texas System.

     In June 1999, the Trans La operations of the Atmos Energy Louisiana Gas
Division appeared before the Louisiana Public Service Commission for a rate
investigation and to redesign rates to mitigate the effects of warm winter
weather. A decision was rendered by the Louisiana Commission in October 1999
that increased service charges associated with customer service calls and
increased the monthly customer charges from $6 to $9, both effective November 1,
1999. While these changes are revenue neutral, they have mitigated the impact of
warmer than normal winter weather on earnings. The decision also included a
three-year rate stabilization clause which will allow the Trans La operations of
Atmos Energy Louisiana Gas Division's rates to be adjusted annually to allow us
to earn a minimum return on equity of 10.5 percent.

     In connection with its review of our acquisition of Louisiana Gas Service,
the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved a rate structure that requires
us to share any cost savings that result from the acquisition with the customers
of Louisiana Gas Service. The shared cost savings will be the difference between
operation and maintenance expense in any future year and the 1998 normalized
expense for Louisiana Gas Service, indexed for inflation, annual changes in
labor costs and customer growth. The customers are not assured any savings in
2001. In 2002 and in future years, the customers are assured annual savings,
which will be indexed for inflation, annual changes in labor costs and customer
growth. The sharing mechanism will remain in place for 20 years subject to
established modification procedures.

     In May 1999, the Western Kentucky Gas Division requested from the Kentucky
Public Service Commission an increase in revenues, a weather normalization
adjustment and changes in rate design to shift a portion of revenues from
commodity charges to fixed rates. In December 1999, the Kentucky Commission
granted an increase in annual revenues of approximately $9.9 million. The new
rates were effective for services rendered on or after December 21, 1999. In
addition, the Kentucky Commission approved a five-year pilot program for weather
normalization beginning in November 2000.

     On June 9, 1998, the Kentucky Commission issued an Order approving a three
year experimental Performance-based Ratemaking mechanism related to gas
procurement and gas transportation activities filed

                                        18
<PAGE>

by the Western Kentucky Gas Division. The Performance-based Ratemaking mechanism
is incorporated into the Western Kentucky Gas Division's gas cost adjustment
clause. As discussed above, it provides for sharing of purchased gas cost
savings between the consumers and us. We recognized other income of $0.2 million
and $2.1 million under the Kentucky Performance-based Ratemaking mechanism in
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. The experimental Performance-based Ratemaking
mechanism expired on June 30, 2001 and the Kentucky Commission has extended it
while it considers the Western Kentucky Gas Division's request for another
mechanism.

     In November 2000, the Greeley Gas Division filed a rate case with the
Colorado Public Utilities Commission for approximately $4.2 million in
additional annual revenues. In May 2001, we received an increase in annual
revenues of approximately $2.8 million from the Colorado Public Utilities
Commission. The new rates went into effect on May 4, 2001.

     Effective April 1, 1999, the Tennessee Regulatory Authority approved the
United Cities Gas Division's request to continue its Performance-based
Ratemaking mechanism related to gas procurement and gas transportation
activities for a three-year period. The Tennessee Regulatory Authority revised
the mechanism from the original two-year experimental period, by increasing the
cap for incentive gains and/or losses to $1.25 million per year. Similar to
Tennessee, the Georgia Public Service Commission renewed our Performance-based
Ratemaking program for an additional three years effective May 1, 1999. The gas
purchase and capacity release mechanisms of the Performance-based Ratemaking
mechanism are designed to provide us incentives to find innovative methods to
lower gas costs to our customers. We recognized other income of $1.0 million and
$0.2 million in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 for the Georgia and Tennessee
Performance-based Ratemaking mechanisms.

     In February 2000, the United Cities Gas Division filed a rate case in
Illinois with the Illinois Commerce Commission requesting an increase in annual
revenues of approximately $3.1 million. After review by the Illinois Commerce
Commission, the amount requested was revised to approximately $2.1 million. The
United Cities Gas Division received an increase in annual revenues of
approximately $1.4 million. The new rates went into effect on October 23, 2000
and are collected primarily through an increase in monthly customer charges.

     In March 2000, the United Cities Gas Division filed a rate case in Virginia
with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia requesting
an increase in annual revenues of approximately $2.3 million. The State
Corporation Commission of Virginia reviewed the filing to determine if it met
the appropriate rules and regulations. In July 2000, we refiled the case
requesting an increase in revenues of approximately $2.1 million. The Commission
accepted the revised filing. In April 2001, the United Cities Gas Division
agreed to an annual rate reduction of $0.5 million effective beginning with the
April 2001 billing cycle.

     In March 2001, the United Cities Gas Division and the Iowa Consumer
Advocate Division of the Department of Justice reached an agreement for an
annual rate reduction of $0.3 million relating to our Iowa operations. The rate
reduction was effective in March 2001.

     We continue to monitor rates in all of our service areas to ensure that
they are adequate for the recovery of service costs and return on investment.

     On September 10, 2001, the United Cities Gas Division filed a request for
accounting order related to uncollectable delinquencies associated with
Moratorium Order of Georgia Public Service Commission dated January 17, 2001. In
our request, we asked the Georgia Commission to issue an accounting authority
order authorizing us to defer as a regulatory asset all costs incurred in
connection with the Moratorium on disconnects ordered by the Georgia Commission
which lasted from January 17, 2001 through April 1, 2001. On September 28, 2001,
the Georgia Commission issued an order authorizing us to create a mechanism for
the recovery of uncollectable delinquencies with an effective date of November
1, 2001. The United Cities Gas Division is authorized to recover through the
recovery mechanism up to $500,000.

WEATHER AND SEASONALITY

     Our natural gas distribution business and irrigation sales business is
seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in our service areas. Natural gas
sales to residential, commercial and public authority customers are affected by
winter heating season requirements. This generally results in higher operating
revenues and net income during the period from October through March of each
year and lower operating revenues and either net losses or lower net income
during the period from April through September of each year. Sales to industrial
customers are much less weather sensitive. Sales to agricultural customers, who
typically use natural gas to power irrigation pumps during the period from March
through September, are affected by rainfall amounts. The effects of colder than
normal winter weather in 2001 and the effects of significantly warmer than
normal winter weather in 2000 and 1999 on our consolidated volumes delivered are
illustrated by the following degree day information. The degree day information
for 2001 and 2000 presented below excludes service areas with weather normalized
operations. Information concerning service areas with weather normalized
operations for 1999 was not available; thus, degree day information presented
for 1999 includes service areas having weather normalized operations.

     The effects of weather that is above or below normal are partially offset
in the Tennessee and Georgia jurisdictions served by the United Cities Gas
Division and in the Kentucky jurisdiction served by the Western Kentucky Gas
Division through weather normalization adjustments. The Georgia Public Service
Commission, the Tennessee Regulatory Authority and the Kentucky Public Service
Commission have approved weather normalization adjustments. The weather
normalization adjustments, effective October through May each year in Georgia,
and November through April each year in Tennessee and Kentucky, allow the United
Cities Gas Division and the Western Kentucky Gas Division to increase the base
rate portion of customers' bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease
the base rate when weather is colder than normal. The net effect of the weather
normalization adjustments was a decrease in revenues of approximately $3.3
million for 2001 compared to an increase in revenues of $4.1 million and $4.4
million in 2000 and 1999. Approximately 375,000 or 26 percent of our meters in
service are located in Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky. We did not have weather
normalization adjustments in our other service areas during the year ended
September 30, 2001. We also received approval to change our rate structure in
our West Texas System of the Energas Division beginning in December 2000 to help
offset some of the negative effects of weather.

     In July 2000, we entered into an agreement to purchase weather hedges for
our Texas and Louisiana operations effective for the 2000 - 2001 heating season.
The hedges were designed to help mitigate the effects of weather that was at
least seven percent warmer than normal in both Texas and Louisiana while
preserving any upside. The cost of the weather hedges was approximately $4.9
million which was amortized over the 2000 - 2001 heating season. The cost of the
weather hedges was more than offset by the positive effects of colder weather on
our gross profit.

     In June 2001, we purchased a three year weather insurance policy with an
option to cancel in the third year if we obtain weather protection in our rate
structures. The policy is for our Texas and Louisiana operations and covers the
entire heating season of October to March beginning with the 2001 - 2002 heating
season. The cost of the three year policy was approximately $13.2 million which
was prepaid and will be amortized over the appropriate heating seasons based on
degree days. The insurance is designed to protect against weather that is at
least seven percent warmer than normal.

                                        20
<PAGE>

     We have historically hedged 20 percent of our gas supply through the use of
our underground storage assets. This hedging process will continue. For the
2001 - 2002 heating season, we plan to cover approximately 64 percent of our
anticipated flowing gas requirements through storage and futures and fixed
forward contracts at a weighted average cost of slightly less than $4.00 per
Mcf. This should provide protection to us and our customers against sharp
increases in the price of natural gas during the 2001 - 2002 heating season.

     For further information regarding the impact of weather and seasonality on
operating results, see Note 16, "Selected Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited)"
in notes to consolidated financial statements herein.

                        CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
                 (SEE "CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS")

     Fiscal 2001 was a year in which total cash inflows exceeded total cash
outflows. This was generally the result of increased cash flows from operating
activities as a result of colder than normal weather partially offset by
increased capital expenditures. Net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt
were used to finance the Louisiana Gas Service Company and LGS Natural Gas
Company acquisition in 2001. Net proceeds from our equity offering were used to
reduce commercial paper debt. Common stock issued primarily through our Employee
Stock Ownership Plan and our Direct Stock Purchase Plan was also used to finance
operations.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

     Items on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended
September 30, 2001 reflect changes in balances for the year, net of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of the additional interest
in Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. and the assets of Louisiana Gas Service Company
and LGS Natural Gas Company. See Note 10 of the accompanying notes to
consolidated financial statements.

     Cash flows from operating activities as reported in the consolidated
statement of cash flows totaled $83.0 million for 2001 compared to $54.2 million
for 2000 and $84.7 million for 1999. The increase in net cash provided by
operating activities from 2000 to 2001 was primarily the result of increases in
net income and other current liabilities and a decrease in accounts receivable
and deferred gas costs partially offset by an increase in cash held on deposit
in margin accounts and a decrease in accounts payable. Also, the net change in
our assets/liabilities from risk management activities added to the increase in
net cash provided by operating activities in 2001. The increase in net income
was primarily due to higher gross profits due to increased volumes and rate
increases. The increase in gross profits was partially offset by an increase in
operating expenses and an increase in interest expense. Also reducing gross
profit was a decrease in miscellaneous income (expense) as a result of charges
incurred related to our performance based-ratemaking mechanisms and the cost of
weather hedges purchased for our Louisiana and Texas operations. In addition,
miscellaneous income (expense) was reduced in 2001 as the result of a gain
recognized on the sale of certain non-regulated assets in 2000 which did not
occur in 2001.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

     During the last three years, a substantial portion of our cash resources
was used to fund technology improvements, acquisitions and our ongoing
construction program to provide natural gas services to a growing customer base.
Net cash used in investing activities totaled $468.1 million in 2001 compared
with $100.1 million in 2000 and $109.6 million in 1999. Capital expenditures in
fiscal 2001 amounted to $113.1 million, compared with $75.6 million in 2000 and
$110.4 million in 1999. The increase in capital expenditures from 2000 to 2001
was primarily the result of additional capital requirements needed due to our
growing customer base. Included in investing activities for 2001 is $363.4
million used to acquire the assets of Louisiana Gas Service Company and LGS
Natural Gas Company as discussed in Note 2 of the notes to consolidated
financial statements. Included in investing activities in 2000 was $32.0 million
used to acquire the Missouri natural gas distribution assets of Associated
Natural Gas. Currently budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal 2002 total
approximately $122.0 million and include funds for additional mains, services,
meters and equipment. In fiscal 2002, we also plan to complete the Mississippi
Valley Gas Company acquisition for $150.0 million plus the assumption of
approximately $45.0 million of long-term debt as discussed in Note 2 of
                                        21
<PAGE>

the notes to consolidated financial statements. Capital expenditures and
acquisitions for fiscal 2002 are planned to be financed from internally
generated funds and financing activities as discussed below. In 2001, we had
$5.4 million in expenditures for assets to be used in leasing activities. In
connection with our acquisition of Woodward Marketing, we received $8.6 million
in cash. In 2001, we received net proceeds of $6.6 million in connection with
the sale of certain utility assets. In 2000, we received net proceeds of $6.5
million in connection with the sale of certain propane assets to Heritage
Propane Partners, L.P.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

     Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $393.0 million for 2001
compared with $44.7 million for 2000 and $28.7 million for 1999. Financing
activities during these periods included issuance of common stock, dividend
payments, short-term borrowings from banks under our credit facilities and
issuance and repayment of long-term debt. The increase in cash provided by
financing activities in 2001 as compared to 2000 was due primarily to the
issuance of long-term debt and the issuance of common stock during 2001. In 2001
we received $347.1 million in net proceeds from our $350.0 million debt offering
in May 2001. The net proceeds were used to help finance the completion of the
Louisiana Gas Service Company and LGS Natural Gas Company acquisition in July
2001. Long-term debt repayments totaled $17.7 million, $14.6 million and $61.0
million for 2001, 2000 and 1999. Repayments of long-term debt in 2001, 2000 and
1999 consisted of annual installments under the various loan documents. During
2001, short-term debt decreased $48.8 million due primarily to the use of the
net proceeds from our equity offering in December 2000 to reduce commercial
paper debt. During 2000, short-term debt increased $81.7 million due to the
effect of warmer weather on net income for 2000, the acquisition of the Missouri
natural gas distribution assets of Associated Natural Gas for $32.0 million and
increases in accounts receivable, cost of gas stored underground and deferred
charges. During 1999, short-term debt increased $101.9 million due largely to
lower net income and cash requirements of $61.0 million for repayments of
long-term debt and capital expenditures of $110.4 million primarily for
technology improvements.

     Issuance of common stock.  We issued 674,468, 704,540 and 849,481 shares of
common stock in 2001, 2000 and 1999 under our various plans. See the
Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity and Note 6 of the accompanying
notes to consolidated financial statements for the number of shares previously
issued and available for future issuance under each of our plans. In addition to
the shares issued under our various plans, we also issued 6,741,500 shares
through our equity offering in December 2000 and 1,423,193 shares of restricted
common stock for the acquisition of the remaining 55 percent of Woodward
Marketing in April 2001. The net proceeds from the equity offering were used to
reduce commercial paper debt as discussed above.

     Cash dividends paid.  We paid $44.1 million in cash dividends during 2001
compared with $36.0 million in 2000 and $33.9 million in 1999. We raised the
dividend $.02 per share during 2001 and $.04 per share during each of 2000 and
1999. The increase in cash dividends in 2001 over 2000 was also due to the
increase in the number of shares outstanding as discussed above.

LIQUIDITY

     The excess of cash inflows over outflows has resulted in a slight decrease
in debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including short-term debt, as
shown in the table below.

     The debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including short-term
debt, was 61.0 percent and 61.6 percent at September 30, 2001 and 2000. Our
long-term plans are to decrease the debt to capitalization ratio to nearer its
target range of 50-52 percent through cash flow generated from operations,
continued issuance of new common stock under our Direct Stock Purchase Plan and
Employee Stock Ownership Plan, access to the debt and equity capital markets and
limiting annual maintenance capital expenditures. It is likely that the debt to
capitalization ratio will remain in its current range in the near term.

     At September 30, 2001, we had short-term committed credit facilities
totaling $318.0 million. One short-term unsecured credit facility is for $300.0
million and serves as a backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper
program. At September 30, 2001, $171.0 million of commercial paper was
outstanding. On August 2, 2001, this facility was renewed for $300.0 million
with an option to increase the amount by $100.0 million. We have a second
facility in place for $18.0 million. At September 30, 2001, $2.2 million was
outstanding under this credit facility. These credit facilities are negotiated
at least annually and are used for working capital purposes.

     At September 30, 2001, our Woodward Marketing subsidiary has an uncommitted
credit facility for $140.0 million which is used for its non-regulated business.
Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, is the sole guarantor
of all amounts outstanding under this facility. At September 30, 2001, $28.0
million was outstanding under this credit facility. Related letters of credit
totaling $38.8 million further reduced the amount available under this facility.
Woodward Marketing also has up to $100.0 million available from Atmos for its
non-regulated business. At September 30, 2001, $100.0 million was outstanding.

     At September 30, 2001, we also had uncommitted short-term credit lines of
$40.0 million, all of which were unused. The uncommitted lines are renewed or
renegotiated at least annually with varying terms and we pay no fee for the
availability of the lines. Borrowings under these lines are made on a when-and
as-available basis at the discretion of the banks.

     The loan agreements pursuant to which our Senior Notes and First Mortgage
Bonds have been issued contain covenants by us with respect to the maintenance
of certain debt-to-equity ratios and cash flows and restrictions on the payment
of dividends. See Note 3 of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial
statements for more information on these covenants.

FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

     We believe that internally generated funds, our credit facilities,
commercial paper program and access to the public debt and equity capital
markets will provide necessary working capital and liquidity for capital
expenditures and other cash needs for fiscal 2002.

                             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000

     Operating revenues increased by 70 percent to $1.4 billion for 2001 from
$850.2 million for 2000. The most significant factors contributing to the
increase in operating revenues were a 58 percent increase in average sales price
due to the increased cost of gas and a 10 percent increase in sales and
transportation volumes due to colder weather. During 2001, excluding service
areas with weather normalized operations, temperatures were 31 percent colder
than in the corresponding period of the prior year and were seven percent colder
than the 30-year normal. The total volume of gas sold and transported for 2001
was 217.8 Bcf compared with 197.6 Bcf for 2000. The average sales price per Mcf
sold increased $3.28 to $8.93 primarily due to an increase in the average cost
of gas. During the early part of our 2001 fiscal year, natural gas prices
throughout the country began to increase significantly. The average cost of gas
per Mcf sold increased to $6.83 for 2001 from $3.79 for 2000. Although we expect
to recover our purchased gas costs from customers through purchased gas
adjustment mechanisms, generally there is a lag between the time we pay for gas
purchases and the time when regulators allow us to place higher rates in service
and recover those gas costs. As a result, we have from time to time used
short-term borrowings to temporarily finance unrecovered purchased gas costs.
Where permitted, we have increased our purchased gas adjustments to help
mitigate the increased cost of gas.
                                        23
<PAGE>

Subsequent to September 30, 2001, gas prices had declined to approximately $2 to
$3 per Mcf. In addition, as a result of the increased gas costs, our accounts
receivable balances during fiscal 2001 increased significantly and,
consequently, we also increased our allowance for doubtful accounts, which we
consider to be adequate. We do not, however, expect this rise in natural gas
prices to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or net cash flows.

     In addition, operating revenues increased due to the impact of rate
increases in Kentucky, Illinois, Colorado, Amarillo, Texas, and West Texas. Also
contributing to the increase in operating revenues was the addition of
approximately 48,000 customers in Missouri due to the Associated Natural Gas
acquisition completed in fiscal 2000 and the addition of approximately 279,000
residential and commercial meters in Louisiana due to the completion of the
Louisiana Gas Service Company acquisition in July 2001. However, operating
revenues were partially offset by a reduction related to our former propane
assets which were placed into a joint venture partnership in August 2000.

     Gross profit increased by 15 percent to $374.7 million for 2001 from $325.7
million for 2000. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increase
in volumes sold to weather sensitive customers, an increase of $5.1 million in
transportation revenues due to higher average transportation revenue per Mcf and
increased volumes and a $6.7 million non-recurring adjustment to purchased gas
cost to reflect state filings. In addition, gross profit increased due to the
impact of rate increases and additional customers, partially offset by a
reduction related to our former propane operations, as discussed previously.
Changes in the cost of gas do not directly affect gross profit because the
fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to our customers.

     On April 1, 2001, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 55 percent
interest in Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. As a result of this acquisition, the
revenues and expenses of Woodward Marketing are now shown on a consolidated
basis.

     Operating expenses increased to $244.9 million for 2001 from $240.4 million
for 2000. Operation and maintenance expense decreased due to savings resulting
from the continued cost control initiatives started during fiscal 2000 and
reduced operation and maintenance expenses associated with our former propane
operations which were placed into a joint venture partnership in fiscal 2000. An
increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of $8.5 million and pension
costs of $4.5 million partially offset this decrease. Pension costs will
increase by $4.4 million in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001. Depreciation and
amortization expense increased due to the completion of the Louisiana Gas
Service Company and LGS Natural Gas Company acquisition in July 2001. Taxes
other than income increased as a result of increased city franchise taxes and
state gross receipts taxes, which are revenue based. However, these taxes are
paid by our customers; thus, these amounts are offset in revenues through
customer billings and have no effect on net income.

     Operating income increased 53 percent for 2001 to $130.3 million from $85.3
million for 2000. The increase in operating income resulted primarily from
increased gross profit described above.

     Equity in earnings of Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. was $8.1 million for the
six months ended March 31, 2001 compared with $7.3 million for the year 2000.

     Miscellaneous income (expense) decreased $9.3 million to $(1.9) million for
2001 compared to $7.4 million for 2000. This decrease was due primarily to
charges incurred related to our Performance-based Ratemaking mechanisms and the
amortization of $4.9 million related to weather hedges purchased for our
Louisiana and Texas operations. In addition, we recognized a gain of $5.8
million in 2000 resulting from the sale of certain non-utility assets. No such
gain occurred in 2001. Partially offsetting the decrease in miscellaneous income
(expense) during 2001 was an increase of $3.0 million in interest income due
primarily to interest income earned on the proceeds from our $350.0 million debt
offering in May 2001. We invested these proceeds in short-term investments until
the completion of the Louisiana Gas Service Company and LGS Natural Gas Company
acquisition in July 2001.

     Interest expense increased $3.2 million to $47.0 million for 2001 compared
to $43.8 million for 2000. This increase was due primarily to interest expense
on the $350.0 million debt offering in May 2001.

                                        24
<PAGE>

     Net income increased for 2001 by $20.2 million to $56.1 million from $35.9
million for 2000. This increase in net income resulted primarily from the
increase in sales volumes due to the colder than normal weather and the impact
of rate increases discussed above.

YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999

     Operating revenues increased by 23 percent to $850.2 million in 2000 from
$690.2 million in 1999. The most significant factors contributing to the
increase in operating revenues were a 25 percent increase in average sales price
due to the increased cost of gas and the impact of rate increases in Amarillo,
Texas and Kentucky. The average sales price per Mcf sold increased $1.12 or 25
percent to $5.65 in 2000 primarily due to an increase in the average cost of
gas. The average cost of gas per Mcf sold increased 36 percent to $3.79 for 2000
from $2.79 for 1999. Also contributing to the increase in operating revenues was
an increase in our non-regulated West Texas irrigation sales volumes related to
irrigation demand and, secondly, to higher average sales prices reflecting
higher gas costs. The increase in irrigation revenues was due to decreased
rainfall during the growing season in West Texas in 2000. Partially offsetting
the increase in operating revenues was a one percent decrease in sales volumes
due to warmer weather. For 2000, excluding service areas with weather normalized
operations, temperatures were five percent warmer than in 1999 and were 18
percent warmer than the 30-year normal. The total volume of gas sold for 2000
was 138.2 Bcf compared with 140.1 Bcf for 1999.

     Gross profit increased by nine percent to $325.7 million for 2000 from
$299.8 million for 1999. The increase in gross profit was due primarily to the
impact of rate increases discussed previously. The increase in gross profit was
also due to the addition of approximately 48,000 Missouri customers due to the
acquisition of the Missouri natural gas distribution assets of Associated
Natural Gas and increased volumes associated with the irrigation business. The
increase in gross profit was slightly offset by a decrease in volumes sold to
weather sensitive customers. Changes in the cost of gas do not directly affect
gross profit because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to our
customers.

     Operating expenses decreased to $240.4 million for 2000 from $245.6 million
for 1999. Operation and maintenance expense decreased due to savings resulting
from the cost control initiatives implemented during 2000 due to the warm winter
weather. However, this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the
provision for doubtful accounts of $8.8 million. The increase in the provision
for doubtful accounts occurred during the transition from local offices to a
centralized customer service center and the implementation of a new company-wide
customer billing system. During this transition, we temporarily suspended
service cutoffs and our normal efforts to collect past due receivables. Actions
to address those issues were initiated in 2000. Depreciation and amortization
expense also increased during 2000 as a result of the first full year of
depreciation being recognized on our process improvement initiatives related to
the new customer information and billing system and the accounting and human
resource systems placed into service during 1999, as well as the acquisition of
the Missouri natural gas distribution assets of Associated Natural Gas in May of
2000.

     Operating income increased 57 percent for 2000 to $85.3 million from $54.2
million in 1999. The increase in operating income resulted primarily from
increased gross profit and decreased operating expenses described above.

     Miscellaneous income (expense), net increased $4.4 million to $7.4 million
in 2000 compared to $3.0 million in 1999. The increase was primarily due the
$5.8 million ($3.7 million after tax) gain resulting from the sale of certain
non-utility assets.

     Interest charges increased $6.7 million to $43.8 million in 2000 from $37.1
million in 1999. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to $3.7 million of
interest being capitalized in 1999 in connection with the significant technology
projects being completed in 1999 and higher average debt outstanding and higher
interest rates for 2000. The increase in average debt outstanding was related to
funding infrastructure, technology, process changes and customer support
investments, as well as additional working capital needed for the increasing gas
costs.

                                        25
<PAGE>

     Net income increased for 2000 by $18.2 million to $35.9 million from $17.7
million for 1999. The increase in net income for 2000 resulted primarily from
the impact of rate increases in 2000 and the increase in miscellaneous income.
Net income was also improved as a result of lower operating expenses.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY

     Our performance in the future will primarily depend on the results of our
utility operations. Several factors exist that could influence Atmos' future
financial performance, some of which are described below. They should be
considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in
this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could
cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in
these forward-looking statements.

  ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS

     Our natural gas sales volumes and related revenues are directly correlated
with heating requirements that result from cold winter weather. Our agricultural
sales volumes are associated with the rainfall levels during the growing season
in our West Texas irrigation market. Weather is one of the most significant
factors influencing our performance. However, as was more fully discussed above,
we have purchased weather insurance to mitigate the effect of warmer than
historically normal weather in our Texas and Louisiana service areas. In
addition, weather normalized rates are in effect in several of our
jurisdictions, which should mitigate the adverse effects of warmer or drier than
normal weather on our operating results.

  NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

     Our operations will always be affected by the conditions and overall
strength of the national, regional and local economies, including interest
rates, changes in the capital markets and increases in the costs of our primary
commodity, natural gas. These factors impact the amount of residential,
industrial and commercial growth in our service territories. Higher costs of
natural gas in recent years have already lead many of our customers to conserve
in the use of our gas services and could lead to even more customers utilizing
such conservation methods.

  RECENT NATIONAL EVENTS

     Our company and our operations have already been indirectly impacted by the
tragic events of September 11, 2001. The terrorist activities on that day have
heightened our awareness of safety and security concerns and have prompted a
company-wide review and assessment of the adequacy of our safety and security
procedures relating to the protection of our customers, employees and our
physical assets. We will continue to monitor and assess our safety and security
procedures and will take all precautions necessary to minimize any adverse
effects on us or our operations. Accordingly, through taking these added
precautions, we believe that we have minimized any potential adverse effects
that any future terrorist activities could have on us or our operations.

  REGULATORY APPROVALS

     Our utility business is subject to various regulated returns on its rate
base in each of the 11 states in which we operate. We monitor the allowed rates
of return, our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings
or operating changes as needed. In addition, in the normal course of the
regulatory environment, assets are placed in service and historical test periods
are established before rate cases can be filed. Once rate cases are filed,
regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates
while studying the cases. Because of this process, we must temporarily suffer
the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the
benefit of rate relief, which is commonly referred to as "regulatory lag". In
addition, our debt and equity financing programs are also subject to approval by
regulatory bodies in five states, which could limit our ability to take
advantage of favorable market conditions.

                                        26
<PAGE>

  SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION AND INTEGRATION OF PENDING ACQUISITION

     Our acquisition strategy depends on our ability to successfully acquire and
integrate the operations of companies such as Mississippi Valley Gas Company,
which acquisition is currently pending. Acquisitions such as Mississippi Valley
should help us achieve greater economies of scale by spreading the fixed costs
of the utility business over a larger customer base. Completion of this
acquisition is subject to state and federal regulatory approval. In addition,
the integration of this acquisition into our operations during the next fiscal
year will require a substantial commitment of financial resources and management
time.

  INFLATION AND INCREASED GAS COSTS

     We believe that inflation has caused, and will continue to cause, increases
in certain operating expenses, and has required, and will continue to require,
assets to be replaced at higher costs. We have a process in place to continually
review the adequacy of our gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of
providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates.
Historically, we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and
investment within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to
continue to do so. The ability to control expenses is an important factor that
will influence future results.

     In addition, the rapid increases in the price of purchased gas during the
past year caused us to experience a significant increase in short-term debt
because we must pay suppliers for such gas when it is purchased long before such
costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas
delivered. Also, the increases in purchased gas costs caused more customers to
be slow to pay their gas bills, leading to accounts receivable that were higher
than normal which in turn lead to higher short-term debt levels and increased
bad debts in fiscal 2001. Should the price of purchased gas increase
significantly in the upcoming heating season, we would expect similar increases
in our short-term debt and accounts receivable during fiscal 2002.

  INCREASED COMPETITION

     We are facing increased competition from other energy suppliers as well as
electric companies and from energy marketing and trading companies. In the case
of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, and agricultural
customers, adverse economic conditions, including higher gas costs, could cause
such customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or to
bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per-unit
costs.

  DEREGULATION OR UNBUNDLING

     We are closely monitoring the development of unbundling initiatives in the
natural gas industry. Unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing
of local distribution gas services into discrete components. It typically
focuses on the separation of the distribution and gas supply components and the
resulting opening of the regulated components of sales services to alternative
unregulated suppliers of those services. Because of brand loyalty in our service
areas, and our enhanced technology and distribution system infrastructures, we
believe that we are now positively positioned as unbundling evolves.
Consequently, we do not expect there would be a significant adverse effect on
our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the natural gas
distribution service business occur.

  HEDGING AND MARKET RISK ACTIVITIES

  Utility Hedging Activities

     To protect against volatility in gas prices, we are hedging gas costs for
the 2001-2002 heating season by utilizing a combination of financial tools and
fixed forward physical contracts to stabilize gas prices. For the 2001-2002
heating season, we plan to cover approximately 64 percent of our anticipated
requirements through storage and hedging instruments. The gas hedges should help
moderate the effects of higher customer accounts receivable caused by higher gas
prices.

                                        27

WOODWARD MARKETING ACTIVITIES

     We acquired a 45 percent interest in Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. in 1997 as
a result of the merger of Atmos and United Cities Gas Company, which had
acquired that interest in 1995. In April 2001, we acquired the 55 percent
interest that we did not own from J.D. Woodward and others for 1,423,193
restricted shares of our common stock. Immediately following the acquisition,
Mr. Woodward was elected as a Senior Vice President of Atmos in charge of all
non-regulated business activities, a position he has held since April 2001.
Prior to that time, Mr. Woodward had not been an officer or employee of Atmos.

     The principal business of Woodward Marketing, including the activities of
Trans Louisiana Industrial Gas Company, Inc., is the overall management of
natural gas requirements for municipalities, local gas utility companies and
industrial customers located primarily in the Southwestern and Midwestern United
States. This business involves the sale of natural gas by Woodward Marketing to
its customers and the management of storage and transportation contracts for its
customers under contracts generally having one to two-year terms. At September
30, 2001, Woodward Marketing had a total of 78 municipal and local gas utility
customers and 195 industrial customers. Woodward Marketing also sells natural
gas to certain of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under
contract terms from 30 days to two years. In addition, Woodward Marketing
supplies us with a portion of our natural gas requirements on a competitive bid
basis.

     In the management of natural gas requirements for municipal and other local
utilities, Woodward Marketing sells physical natural gas for future delivery and
hedges the associated price risk through the use of gas futures, including
forwards, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options, and swap contracts with
counterparties. These financial contracts are marked-to-market at the daily
close of business. Woodward Marketing links gas futures to physical delivery of
natural gas and balances its futures positions at the end of each trading day.
Over-the-counter swap agreements require Woodward Marketing to receive or make
payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price of
natural gas on the settlement date. Woodward Marketing uses these futures and
swaps to manage margins on offsetting fixed-price purchase or sale commitments
for physical quantities of natural gas, which are also carried on a mark to
market basis. Options held to hedge price risk provide the right, but not the
requirement, to buy or sell energy commodities at a fixed price. Woodward
Marketing uses options to manage margins and to limit overall price risk
exposure.

     Energy related services provided by Woodward Marketing include the sale of
natural gas to its various customer classes and management of transportation and
storage assets and inventories. More specifically, energy services include
contract negotiation and administration, load forecasting, storage acquisition,
natural gas purchase and delivery and capacity utilization strategies. In
providing these services, Woodward Marketing generates income from its utility,
municipal and industrial customers through negotiated prices based on the volume
of gas supplied to the customer. Woodward Marketing also generates income by
taking advantage of the difference between near-term gas prices and prices for
future delivery as well as the daily movement of gas prices by utilizing storage
and transportation capacity that it controls.

     Woodward Marketing also engages in limited speculative natural gas trading
for its own account, subject to a risk management policy established by us which
limits the level of trading loss in any fiscal year to a maximum of 25 percent
of the budgeted annual operating income of Woodward Marketing. Compliance with
such risk management policy is monitored on a daily basis. In addition, Woodward
Marketing's bank credit facility limits trading positions that are not closed at
the end of the day (open positions) to 2.5 Bcf of natural gas. At September 30,
2001, Woodward Marketing's open positions in its trading operations totaled 2.3
Bcf. In its speculative trading, Woodward Marketing's open trading positions are
monitored on a daily basis but are not required to be closed if they remain
within the limits set by the bank loan agreement. Woodward Marketing had an
unrealized trading gain of $4.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2001, but there can be no assurance that Woodward Marketing will have any
speculative trading gain in the future. In some prior years, Woodward Marketing
has experienced losses in its speculative trading business. The financial
exposure that results from the daily fluctuations of gas prices and the
potential for daily price movements constitutes a risk of loss since the price
of natural gas purchased for future delivery at the beginning of the day may not
be hedged until later in the day.

                                        28
<PAGE>

     Financial instruments, which subject Woodward Marketing to counterparty
risk, consist primarily of financial instruments arising from trading and risk
management activities and overnight repurchase agreements that are not insured.
Counterparty risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by financial
counterparties to a contract. Exchange-traded future and option contracts are
generally guaranteed by the exchanges.

     Woodward Marketing's operations are concentrated in the natural gas
industry, and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks
affecting that industry.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments is the potential
loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas commodity prices and interest
rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analysis does not, however, consider
the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor
do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate exposure to such
changes. Actual results may differ.

GAS PRICES

     We purchase natural gas for our regulated and non-regulated natural gas
operations. Substantially all of the cost of gas purchased for regulated
operations is recovered through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms. We have a
limited market risk in gas prices related to gas purchases in the open market at
spot prices for sale to non-regulated energy services customers at fixed prices.
As a result, our earnings could be affected by changes in the price and
availability of such gas. To protect against volatility in gas prices, we from
time to time hedge our gas costs by purchasing futures contracts. Our utility
segment does not use such financial instruments for trading purposes and we are
not a party to any leveraged derivatives. Market risk is estimated as a
hypothetical 10 percent increase in the portion of our gas cost related to
fixed-price non-regulated sales. Based on projected fiscal 2002 non-regulated
gas sales at fixed prices, such an increase would result in an increase to cost
of gas of approximately $2.7 million in fiscal 2002, before considering the
effect of swap agreements outstanding as of September 30, 2001. As of September
30, 2001, we had entered into swap agreements to lock in gas costs for certain
outstanding fixed-price sales agreements. We plan to mitigate the risk of
increased gas purchase costs for fixed-price customers by entering into swap
agreements to lock in purchased gas cost for estimated sales volumes in fiscal
2002.

     In April 2001, we acquired the 55 percent interest in Woodward Marketing
that we did not already own. Woodward Marketing's principal business is the
management of natural gas requirements for municipalities, local gas utility
companies and industrial customers located primarily in the Southwestern and
Midwestern United States. This business involves the sale of natural gas and the
management of storage and transportation contracts for customers under contracts
generally having one to two-year terms. Woodward Marketing also sells natural
gas to industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under contract terms
from 30 days to two years. In the management of natural gas requirements for
municipal and other local utilities, Woodward Marketing sells natural gas for
future delivery and hedges price risk through the use of gas futures including
forwards, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options, futures and swap
contracts. Financial contracts are marked-to-market at the daily close of
business.

     Woodward Marketing also engages in limited speculative natural gas trading
for its own account, subject to a risk management policy established by us which
limits the level of trading loss in any fiscal year to a maximum of 25 percent
of the budgeted operating income of Woodward Marketing. Compliance with such
risk management policy is monitored on a daily basis. In addition, Woodward
Marketing's bank credit facility limits open trading positions to 2.5 Bcf of
natural gas. At September 30, 2001, Woodward Marketing's open positions in its
trading operations totaled 2.3 Bcf. In its trading, Woodward Marketing's open
trading positions are monitored on a daily basis but are not required to be
closed if within the limits set by the bank credit facility. The financial
exposure that results from the daily fluctuations of gas prices and the
potential for daily price movements have an impact on the net open position.
Based on its open positions at September 30, 2001, a $.50 increase in market
strip would result in a $1.2 million decrease in the speculative trading gain. A
$.50 decrease in market strip would result in a $1.2 million increase in the
speculative trading gain.

<PAGE>

     Woodward Marketing uses gas futures contracts, including but not limited
to, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap agreements, in the
conduct of its business. Woodward Marketing links gas futures to physical
delivery of natural gas and balances its futures positions at the end of each
trading day. Over-the-counter swap agreements require Woodward Marketing to
receive or make payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the
market price of natural gas on the settlement date. Woodward Marketing uses
futures and swaps to manage margins on offsetting fixed-price purchase or sale
commitments for physical quantities of natural gas. Options held to hedge price
risk provide the right, but not the requirement, to buy or sell energy
commodities at a fixed price. Woodward Marketing uses options to manage margins
and to limit overall price risk exposure.

     Counterparty risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by financial
counterparties to a contract. Financial instruments, which subject Woodward
Marketing to counterparty risk, consist primarily of financial instruments
arising from trading and risk management activities and overnight repurchase
agreements that are not insured. Exchange traded future and option contracts are
generally guaranteed by the exchanges.

     Woodward Marketing's operations are concentrated in the natural gas
industry, and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks
affecting that industry. Therefore, an economic downturn in the industry could
have an adverse affect on the creditworthiness of Woodward Marketing's
customers. Woodward Marketing manages credit risk to attempt to minimize its
exposure to uncollectible receivables. In compliance with Woodward Marketing's
existing credit policy, prospective and existing customers are reviewed for
creditworthiness and customers not meeting minimum standards, at the discretion
of management, provide security deposits and are subject to various requisite
secured payment terms.

INTEREST RATES

     Our earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates as a
result of our issuance of short-term commercial paper and our other short-term
borrowings. If market interest rates for short-term borrowings average two
percent more in fiscal 2002 than they did during fiscal 2001, our interest
expense would increase by approximately $4.0 million.

     Market risk for fixed-rate long-term obligations is estimated as the
potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent
decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately $57.5 million based on
discounted cash flow analyses.

     As of September 30, 2001, we were not engaged in other activities which
would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to
changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or market commodity
prices.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity
of the financial statements and other financial information in this report. The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and include estimates and judgments
made by management that were necessary to prepare the statements in accordance
with such accounting principles.

     The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded from loss and that
transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with established
procedures. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition that
the cost of maintaining a system of internal accounting controls should not
exceed related benefits. The system of internal accounting controls is supported
by written policies and guidelines, internal auditing and the careful selection
and training of qualified personnel.

     The financial statements have been audited by the Company's independent
auditors. Their audit was made in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, as indicated in the Report of Independent
Auditors and included a review of the system of internal accounting controls and
tests of transactions to the extent they considered necessary to carry out their
responsibilities for the audit.

     Management has considered the internal auditors' and the independent
auditors' recommendations concerning the Company's system of internal accounting
controls and has taken actions that are believed to be cost-effective in the
circumstances to respond appropriately to these recommendations. The Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors meets periodically with the internal
auditors and the independent auditors to discuss the Company's internal
accounting controls, auditing and financial reporting matters.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Atmos Energy Corporation

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Atmos
Energy Corporation as of September 30, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2001. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a).
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Atmos Energy Corporation at September 30, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September 30, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Description of business -- Atmos Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries
are engaged primarily in the natural gas utility business as well as certain
non-regulated businesses. We distribute through sales and transportation
arrangements natural gas to approximately 1.4 million residential, commercial,
public authority and industrial customers through our five regulated utility
divisions: Atmos Energy Louisiana Gas Division in Louisiana; Energas Division in
Texas; Greeley Gas Division in Colorado, Kansas and Missouri; United Cities Gas
Division in Illinois, Tennessee, Iowa, Virginia, Georgia and Missouri; and
Western Kentucky Gas Division in Kentucky. Such business is subject to federal
and state regulation and/or regulation by local authorities in each of the
states in which the utility divisions operate. Our shared services unit is
located in Dallas, Texas and our customer support centers are located in
Amarillo, Texas and Metairie, Louisiana. Our non-regulated businesses include
various energy service businesses as described below.

     Through Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC, we are engaged in gas marketing and
energy management services. Atmos Energy Marketing provides gas supply
management services to industrial customers, municipalities and local
distribution companies including our five regulated utility divisions. Woodward
Marketing, L.L.C. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Atmos Energy Marketing.

     Through Atmos Pipeline and Storage, L.L.C., we own and operate natural gas
storage fields in Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana to supplement natural gas used
by customers of the regulated utility divisions in Kansas, Kentucky, Tennessee
and Louisiana and to provide storage services to other customers including
customers in other states.

     Through Atmos Power Systems, Inc., we construct and operate electrical
power generating plants and associated facilities. Atmos Power Systems may also
enter into agreements to either lease or sell such plants.

     In addition, our non-regulated businesses market gas to industrial
customers in West Texas, provide various retail services and own an indirect
interest in Heritage Propane Partners as described below.

     We were formerly engaged in the retail and wholesale distribution of
propane gas through United Cities Propane Gas, Inc. On February 15, 2000, we
entered into an agreement to form a joint venture which combined our propane
operations with the propane operations of three other unrelated companies. The
combined joint venture was named U.S. Propane, L.P. On June 15, 2000, U.S.
Propane, in which we are a 19 percent partner, entered into an agreement to
combine its operations with Heritage Holdings, Inc. Upon closing of this
transaction, which occurred in August 2000, U.S. Propane owns all of the general
partnership interest and approximately 30 percent of the limited partnership
interest in Heritage Propane Partners, a publicly traded master limited
partnership. Through our ownership in U.S. Propane, we own an approximate 6
percent interest in Heritage Propane Partners.

     Principles of consolidation -- The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Atmos Energy Corporation and its
subsidiaries. Each subsidiary is wholly-owned and all material intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.

     Prior to April 1, 2001, we owned a 45 percent interest in Woodward
Marketing and accounted for that ownership using the equity method of accounting
for investments. Subsequent to April 1, 2001, we own 100 percent of Woodward
Marketing and account for that ownership on a consolidated basis. See Note 2,
"Acquisitions".

     Subsequent to August 10, 2000 we account for our interest in U.S. Propane
using the equity method of accounting.

     Intangible assets -- Intangible assets consist of customer contracts. The
weighted average amortization period is 10 years.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Goodwill -- Total goodwill was $64.7 million and $3.1 million at September
30, 2001 and 2000. Goodwill applicable to the utility segment was $49.8 million
and zero at September 30, 2001 and 2000. Goodwill applicable to the
non-regulated segment was $14.9 million and $3.1 million at September 30, 2001
and 2000. Goodwill applicable to the utility segment resulted from the
acquisition of the Louisiana Gas Service Company assets on July 1, 2001 and is
not subject to amortization under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Goodwill
applicable to the non-regulated segment was amortized over 20 years through
September 30, 2001. Effective October 1, 2001, goodwill applicable to the
non-regulated segment will not be amortized under the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142.

     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets -- We periodically evaluate whether events
or circumstances have occurred that indicate that excess of cost over net assets
acquired and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable or that the
remaining useful life may warrant revision. When such events or circumstances
are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining
whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash
flows. In the event the sum of the expected future cash flows resulting from the
use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment
loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is
recorded. To date, no such impairment has been recognized.

     Regulation -- Our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect
to rates, service, maintenance of accounting records and various other matters
by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. Our
accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the ratemaking and
accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions.
Regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation." This statement requires cost-based rate regulated entities
that meet certain criteria to reflect the authorized recovery of costs due to
regulatory decisions in their financial statements.

     We record regulatory assets which represent assets that are being recovered
through customer rates or are probable of being recovered through customer
rates. Significant regulatory assets as of September 30, 2001 included the
following: merger and integration costs of $24.2 million, net of related
reserves and accumulated amortization and environmental costs of $3.7 million.
Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues
associated with amounts that are to be credited to customers through the
ratemaking process. As of September 30, 2001, we had recorded a regulatory
liability of $3.8 million for deferred income taxes.

     Revenue recognition -- Sales of natural gas are billed on a monthly cycle
basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do
not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting
purposes. We follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas
revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers, but not yet
billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related
costs are charged to expense. Estimated losses due to credit risk are reserved
at the time revenue is recognized.

     Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts -- Accounts
receivable consists of natural gas sales to residential, commercial, industrial,
agricultural and other customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
computed based on the aging of outstanding accounts receivable and historical
collections experience and represents in management's opinion, an adequate
allowance to provide for probable uncollectable accounts.

     Utility property, plant and equipment -- Utility property, plant and
equipment is stated at original cost net of contributions in aid of
construction. The cost of additions includes direct construction costs, payroll
related costs (taxes, pensions and other fringe benefits), administrative and
general costs and an allowance for funds used during construction. (See
allowance for funds used during construction below). Major renewals

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

and betterments are capitalized while the costs of maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred. The costs of large projects are accumulated in
construction in progress until the project is completed. When the project is
completed, tested and placed in service, the balance is transferred to the
utility plant in service account included in the rate base and depreciation
begins. Property, plant and equipment is depreciated at various rates on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The composite
rates were 3.7 percent for 2001, 4.1 percent for 2000 and 4.0 percent for 1999.
At the time property, plant and equipment is retired, the cost, plus removal
expenses less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.

     Allowance for funds used during construction -- Allowance for funds used
during construction represents the estimated cost of funds used to finance the
construction of major projects. Under regulatory practices, the costs are
capitalized and included in rate base for ratemaking purposes when the completed
projects are placed in service. Interest expense of $1.2 million and $3.7
million were capitalized in 2001 and 1999. No interest expense was capitalized
during 2000.

     Non-utility property, plant and equipment -- Balances are stated at cost
and depreciation is generally computed on the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes.

     Inventories -- Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies and
merchandise held for resale. These inventories are stated at the lower of
average cost or market.

     Gas stored underground -- Net additions of inventory gas to storage and
withdrawals of inventory gas from storage are priced using the average cost
method for all our utility divisions, except for the United Cities Gas Division,
where it is priced on the first-in first-out method. Gas stored underground and
owned by Atmos Pipeline and Storage is priced on the last-in first-out method.
Pursuant to the United Cities Gas Division's purchased gas adjustment clause,
the liquidation of a LIFO layer would be reflected in subsequent gas adjustments
in customer rates and does not affect the results of operations. Gas in storage
that is retained as cushion gas to maintain reservoir pressure is classified as
property, plant and equipment and is priced at cost.

     Risk management assets, non-regulated segment -- We use storage,
transportation and requirements contracts, forwards, over-the-counter and
exchange-traded options, futures and swap contracts to conduct our risk
management activities. We use the mark-to-market method to account for these
activities in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98-10,
"Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." Under this
method, the aforementioned contracts are reflected at fair value, inclusive of
future servicing costs and valuation adjustments, with resulting unrealized
gains and losses recorded as assets or liabilities from risk management
activities on the consolidated balance sheet. Current period changes in the
assets and liabilities from risk management activities are recognized as net
gains or losses on the consolidated statement of income. Changes in the assets
and liabilities from risk management activity result primarily from changes in
the valuation of the portfolio of contracts, maturity and settlement of
contracts and newly originated transactions. Market prices and models used to
value these transactions reflect our best estimate considering various factors
including closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and
volatility factors underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the
potential impact of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a
reasonable period of time under present market conditions. Changes in market
prices directly affect our estimate of the fair value of these transactions.

     At September 30, 2001, we had 3,800 open contracts, representing 2.3 Bcf
notional volumes, that were marked to market with average contract maturities of
less than two years. The $4.5 million mark-to-market gain associated with these
positions was recorded as unrealized trading margin on the consolidated
statement of income.

     Effective April 1, 2001, natural gas sales from our natural gas trading
operations are netted against purchased gas costs and shown as gas trading
margin on the consolidated statements of income. For the six months ended
September 30, 2001, our gas trading margin consisted of a $4.0 million realized
trading loss and a $4.5 million unrealized trading gain.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     Risk management assets, utility segment -- Our business units have entered
into financial instruments for the 2001-2002 heating season. The purpose of
entering into these financial instruments is to protect us and our customers
from unusually large winter period gas price increases. We use the
mark-to-market method to account for these activities as described above. In
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 "Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation", current period changes in the assets
and liabilities from risk management activities are recorded as deferred gas
costs on the consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, there is no earnings
impact as a result of the use of these financial instruments. See Note 14. Upon
maturity, the contracts are recognized in purchased gas cost.

     Income taxes -- Income taxes are provided based on the liability method,
resulting in income tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences.
Temporary differences are differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will
result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. The liability method
requires the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred
income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted.
The liability method also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a
valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be
realized.

     Cash and cash equivalents -- We consider all highly liquid investments with
an initial or remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

     Deferred charges and other assets -- Deferred charges and other assets at
September 30, 2001 and 2000 include merger and integration costs of $24.2
million and $30.0 million, net of the related reserve for possible non-recovery
and accumulated amortization; the investment in Woodward Marketing of $17.4
million at September 30, 2000; and the indirect investment in Heritage Propane
Partners of $23.8 million and $25.0 million in 2001 and 2000. Also included in
deferred charges and other assets are assets of our qualified defined benefit
retirement plans in excess of the plans' obligations of $44.4 million and $36.1
million, assets related to the nonqualified retirement plans of $25.1 million
and $28.6 million, unamortized debt expense of $9.7 million and $5.4 million and
deferred asset projects of $12.6 million and $10.9 million in 2001 and 2000.

     Deferred credits and other liabilities -- Deferred credits and other
liabilities at September 30, 2001 and 2000 include customer advances for
construction of $11.7 million and $10.9 million; obligations under other
postretirement benefits of $38.1 million and $25.2 million in 2001 and 2000; and
obligations under our nonqualified retirement plans of $34.2 million and $31.0
million in 2001 and 2000.

     Earnings per share -- The calculation of basic earnings per share is based
on net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on net
income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the
dilutive shares related to the United Cities Gas Division's Long-term Stock
Plan, the Long-Term Incentive Plan and Atmos' Restricted Stock Grant Plan.

     Comprehensive income -- In 1999, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." This statement
requires reporting of comprehensive income and its components (revenues,
expenses, gains and losses) in any complete presentation of general purpose
financial statements. Comprehensive income describes all changes, except those
resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners, in the equity
of a business enterprise from transactions and other events including, as
applicable, foreign-currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments and
unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity
securities. While the primary component of comprehensive income is our reported
net income, the other components of comprehensive income relate to unrealized
gains and losses associated with certain investments held as available for sale.

     Use of estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial
                                        40

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

     Weather insurance and hedges -- In June 2001, we purchased a three year
weather insurance policy with an option to cancel in the third year if we obtain
weather protection in our rate structures. The policy is for our Texas and
Louisiana operations and covers the entire heating season of October to March
beginning with the 2001 - 2002 heating season. The cost of the three year policy
was approximately $13.2 million which was prepaid and will be amortized over the
appropriate heating seasons. The insurance is designed to protect against
weather that is warmer than normal.

     In July 2000, we entered into an agreement to purchase weather hedges for
our Texas and Louisiana operations effective for the 2000 - 2001 heating season.
The hedges were designed to help mitigate the effects of weather that was at
least seven percent warmer than normal in both Texas and Louisiana while
preserving any upside. The cost of the weather hedges was approximately $4.9
million which was amortized over the 2000 - 2001 heating season. The cost of the
weather hedges was more than offset by the positive effects of colder weather on
our gross profit.

     Recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted -- In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations." This statement addresses financial
accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 16, "Business Combinations," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 38, "Accounting for Pre-acquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises."
All business combinations in the scope of this Statement are to be accounted for
using the purchase method. The provisions of this Statement were applied to the
acquisition of Louisiana Gas Service Company and LGS Natural Gas Company
effective July 1, 2001.

     In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17,
"Intangible Assets." This Statement addresses the accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets after they have been initially recognized in the
financial statements. This Statement requires that goodwill and other intangible
assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be
subject to impairment tests. This Statement was adopted effective July 1, 2001
with respect to goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in connection with
the Louisiana Gas Service Company and LGS Natural Gas Company acquisition. See
Note 2 "Acquisitions". With respect to our other intangible assets and goodwill,
this Statement was adopted effective October 1, 2001. The proforma effect on
goodwill amortization of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142 is not material.

     In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." This Statement addresses financial accounting
and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The
provisions of this Statement are effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We are currently in the process
of evaluating the impact the adoption of this Statement will have on our
financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows.

     Reclassifications -- Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.

2.  ACQUISITIONS

  COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OF REMAINING EQUITY INTEREST IN WOODWARD MARKETING

     In April 2001, we acquired from Woodward Marketing, Inc. the 55 percent
interest in Woodward Marketing, L.L.C. that we did not already own in exchange
for 1,423,193 restricted shares of our common stock. The consideration is
subject to an upward adjustment, based on our share price, of up to 232,547
shares plus an amount of shares to compensate for dividends paid after the
completion of the acquisition. The pro forma effects for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2001 of combining 100 percent of Woodward Marketing's results of
operations with Atmos' consolidated results of operations are a $17.9 million
increase in gas trading margin to $18.4 million, elimination of the $8.1 million
equity in earnings of Woodward Marketing, a $6.2 million increase in net income
to $62.3 million and a $.13 increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.60.

     Such pro forma effects for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 are a
$16.2 million increase in gas trading margin to $16.2 million, elimination of
the $7.3 million equity in earnings of Woodward Marketing, a $5.7 million
increase in net income to $41.2 million and a $.12 increase in diluted earnings
per share to $1.26.

     The acquisition enabled us to control Woodward Marketing's future direction
and strategies. Results of 100 percent of Woodward Marketing's operations are
consolidated with our results of operations for the third and fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2001.

     The following table summarizes the fair market value of the 55 percent of
Woodward Marketing's assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of April 1,
2001, in thousands:

     Other intangible assets represent the fair market value of non-compete
contracts. The cost assigned to these contracts is being amortized over 10
years. The value assigned to goodwill was based on our belief that ownership of
100 percent of Woodward Marketing would enable us to exercise greater control
over Woodward Marketing's operation, thereby increasing its value. We expect
that the goodwill amount will not be deductible for tax purposes.

  COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OF NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS IN LOUISIANA

     Effective July 1, 2001, we acquired the assets of Louisiana Gas Service
Company and LGS Natural Gas Company for $363.4 million. The acquired assets
provide natural gas distribution service through approximately 279,000
residential and commercial meters in southeastern and northern Louisiana. The
service territory includes the suburban areas of metropolitan New Orleans
(excluding Orleans Parish), the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain and the
Monroe/West Monroe metropolitan area. The non-regulated operations, which
includes an intrastate pipeline company, provide gas transportation service to
industrial customers in Louisiana and to the acquired assets.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     The acquisition increased the size of our operations in Louisiana and
allowed us to achieve certain synergies and cost savings by combining the
acquired operations with our existing Louisiana operations. Results of
operations of the Louisiana Gas Service assets are consolidated with our results

     Other intangible assets represent the fair market value of industrial
customer contracts and are being amortized over 10 years. The value assigned to
goodwill was based on our belief that the acquisition of the Louisiana Gas
assets will enable us to realize cost savings in the state of Louisiana when
combined with our existing Louisiana operations. We expect that the entire
goodwill amount will be deductible for tax purposes.

     The pro forma effects for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 of
combining the results of operations of the Louisiana Gas assets with our
consolidated results of operations are a $306.2 million increase in operating
revenues to $1.7 billion, a $24.2 million decrease in net income to $31.9
million and a $.64 decrease in diluted earnings per share to $.83.

     Such pro forma effects for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 are a
$186.1 million increase in operating revenues to $1.0 billion, a $6.9 million
decrease in net income to $29.0 million and a $.22 decrease in diluted earnings
per share to $.92.

  PENDING ACQUISITION OF MISSISSIPPI VALLEY GAS COMPANY

     In September 2001, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
Mississippi Valley Gas Company, a privately held natural gas utility. This
acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase and will be acquired using $75.0
million in cash and the issuance of $75.0 million in our common stock. We will
also assume Mississippi Valley Gas' outstanding debt, net of working capital, of
approximately $45.0 million. Mississippi Valley Gas provides natural gas
distribution service to more than 261,500 residential, commercial, industrial
and other customers located primarily in the northern and central regions of
Mississippi. Mississippi Valley Gas has two underground storage facilities with
2.05 Bcf of working gas capacity. The acquisition must be approved by the
Mississippi Public Service Commission, the issuance of our stock must be
approved by five of the states in which we operate and the transaction must
comply with the provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
It is anticipated that the acquisition will be completed in fiscal 2002.

     Most of the Senior Notes and First Mortgage Bonds contain provisions that
allow us to prepay the outstanding balance in whole at any time, subject to a
prepayment premium. The Senior Note agreements and First Mortgage Bond
indentures provide for certain cash flow requirements and restrictions on
additional indebtedness, sale of assets and payment of dividends. Under the most
restrictive of such covenants, cumulative cash dividends paid after December 31,
1988 may not exceed the sum of accumulated net income for periods after December
31, 1988 plus $15.0 million. At September 30, 2001, approximately $56.7 million
of retained earnings was unrestricted.

     As of September 30, 2001, all of the Greeley Gas Division utility plant
assets with a net book value of approximately $174.4 million are subject to a
lien under the 9.4 percent Series J First Mortgage Bonds assumed by us in the
acquisition of Greeley Gas Company. Also, substantially all of the United Cities
Gas Division utility plant assets, totaling approximately $314.1 million, are
subject to a lien under the Indenture of Mortgage of the Series P through V
First Mortgage Bonds.

     Based on the borrowing rates currently available to us for debt with
similar terms and remaining average maturities, the fair value of long-term debt
at September 30, 2001 and 2000 is estimated, using discounted cash flow
analysis, to be $709.9 million and $368.8 million.

  SHORT-TERM DEBT

     At September 30, 2001, short-term debt was composed of $171.0 million of
commercial paper and $30.2 million outstanding under two bank credit facilities.
At September 30, 2000, it was composed of $250.0 million of commercial paper.
The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding was 4.0
percent and 7.0 percent at September 30, 2001 and 2000.

  Committed credit facilities

     We have short-term committed credit facilities totaling $318.0 million. One
short-term unsecured credit facility is for $300.0 million and serves as a
backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper program. Our commercial paper
is rated A-2 by Standard and Poor's and P-2 by Moody's. At September 30, 2001,
$171.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding. On August 2, 2001, this
facility was renewed for $300.0 million with an option to increase the amount by
$100.0 million. We have a second facility in place for $18.0 million. At
September 30, 2001, $2.2 million was outstanding under this credit facility. No
amounts were outstanding under this credit facility at September 30, 2000. These
credit facilities are negotiated at least annually and are used for working
capital purposes.

  Uncommitted credit facilities

     Our Woodward Marketing subsidiary has an uncommitted credit facility for
$140.0 million which is used for its non-regulated business. Atmos Energy
Marketing, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is the sole guarantor of all
amounts outstanding under this facility. At September 30, 2001, $28.0 million
was outstanding under this credit facility. Related letters of credit totaling
$38.8 million further reduced the amount available under this facility.

     We also have unsecured short-term uncommitted credit lines from two banks
totaling $40.0 million. There were no borrowings under these uncommitted credit
facilities at September 30, 2001 and 2000. The uncommitted lines are renewed or
renegotiated at least annually with varying terms and we pay no fee for the
availability of the lines. Borrowings under these lines are made on a when- and
as-available basis at the discretion of the banks.

5.  CONTINGENCIES

  LITIGATION

  Greeley Gas Division

     On September 23, 1999, a suit was filed in the District Court of Stevens
County, Kansas, by Quinque Operating Company, Tom Boles and Robert Ditto,
against more than 200 companies in the natural gas industry including us and our
Greeley Gas Division. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent a class
consisting of gas producers, royalty owners, overriding royalty owners, working
interest owners and state taxing authorities, accuse the defendants of
underpaying royalties on gas taken from wells situated on non-federal and
non-Indian lands throughout the United States and offshore waters predicated
upon allegations that the defendants' gas measurements are simply inaccurate and
that the defendants failed to comply with applicable regulations and industry
standards over the last 25 years. Although the plaintiffs do not specifically
allege an amount of damages, they contend that this suit is brought to recover
billions of dollars in revenues that the defendants have allegedly unlawfully
diverted from the plaintiffs to themselves. On April 10, 2000, this case was
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings with other similar pending litigation in
federal court in Wyoming in which we are also a defendant along with over 200
other defendants in the case of In Re Natural Gas Royalties Quitam Litigation.
In January 2001, the federal court elected to remand this case back to the
Kansas state court. A reconsideration of remand was filed, but it was denied.
The state court now has jurisdiction over this proceeding and has issued a
preliminary case management order. We believe that the plaintiffs' claims are
lacking in merit, and we intend to vigorously defend this action. While the
results of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the
final outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows because we believe
that we have adequate insurance and/or reserves to cover any damages that may
ultimately be awarded.

  Energas Division

     On May 18, 2001, a suit was filed in the 99th District Court of Lubbock
County, Texas, by the City of Lubbock, Texas, and the West Texas Municipal
Agency against Stewart & Stevenson Energy Products, Inc., a division of GE
Packaged Power, Inc. ("GE") and our Energas Division. The action arises out of
(i) the construction and installation of a gas-fired electric generating
facility designed and installed by GE and (ii) the natural gas pipeline, which
provides natural gas to the facility, that was designed and installed by our
Energas Division. The plaintiffs allege that they incurred damages as a result
of certain corrosive products that were introduced into the facility's turbine
that damaged the turbine and necessitated repair costs of

                                        47

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

approximately $0.9 million and consequential damages of approximately $4.7
million comprised of electric power purchases made by the plaintiffs from other
sources while the facility was inoperative or operating below specifications.
The causes of action asserted by the plaintiffs against the Energas Division
include breach of contract, breach of warranty and negligence. We have denied
any liability and intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs' claims.
While the results of this litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we
believe the final outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows
because we believe that we have adequate insurance and/or reserves to cover any
damages that may ultimately be awarded.

  Atmos Energy Louisiana Gas Division

     Prior to our acquisition of the assets of Louisiana Gas Service Company, a
division of Citizens Communications Company on July 1, 2001, Louisiana Gas
Service Company was involved in a proceeding with the Louisiana Public Service
Commission relating to past costs associated with the purchase of gas that it
charged to its customers. Subsequent to our acquisition of the Louisiana Gas
assets on July 1, 2001, we have taken over the defense of this proceeding and
will have responsibility for administering and assuring the payment of refunds
and/or credits to ratepayers that may arise from Citizens Communications' past
activities with respect to the purchased gas costs. However, we believe the
outcome of this proceeding will not have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows as Citizens
Communications has agreed to fully indemnify us for any liability that may arise
out of this proceeding.

  United Cities Propane Gas, Inc.

     United Cities Propane Gas, Inc., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a
party to an action filed in June 2000 which is pending in the Circuit Court of
Sevier County, Tennessee. The plaintiffs' claims arise out of injuries alleged
to have been caused by a low-level propane explosion. The plaintiffs seek to
recover damages of $13.0 million. Discovery activities have begun in this case.
We have denied any liability, and we intend to vigorously defend against the
plaintiffs' claims. While the results of this litigation cannot be predicted
with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or net
cash flows because we believe that we have adequate insurance and/or reserves to
cover any damages that may ultimately be awarded.

     We are a party to other litigation and claims that arise out of our
ordinary business. While the results of such litigation and claims cannot be
predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such litigation and
claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or net cash flows because we believe that we have adequate
insurance and reserves to cover any damages that may ultimately be awarded.

  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

  Manufactured Gas Plant Sites

     The United Cities Gas Division is the owner or previous owner of
manufactured gas plant sites in Johnson City and Bristol, Tennessee and
Hannibal, Missouri which were used to supply gas prior to availability of
natural gas. The gas manufacturing process resulted in certain by-products and
residual materials including coal tar. The manufacturing process used by our
predecessors was an acceptable and satisfactory process at the time such
operations were being conducted. Under current environmental protection laws and
regulations, we may be responsible for response actions with respect to such
materials if response actions are necessary.

     United Cities Gas Company and the Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation entered into a consent order effective January 23, 1997, to
facilitate the investigation, removal and remediation of the Johnson City site.
United Cities Gas Company began the implementation of the consent order in the
first

quarter of 1997 which continued through September 30, 2001. The investigative
phase of the work at the site has been completed. An interim removal action was
completed in June 2001. The Tennessee Regulatory Authority granted United Cities
Gas Company permission to defer, until its next rate case, all costs incurred in
Tennessee in connection with state and federally mandated environmental control
requirements.

     On July 22, 1998, we entered into an Abatement Order on Consent with the
Missouri Department of Natural Resources addressing the former manufactured gas
plant located in Hannibal, Missouri. Through our United Cities Gas Division, we
agreed to perform a removal action, a subsequent site evaluation and to
reimburse the response costs incurred by the state of Missouri in connection
with the property. The removal action was conducted and completed in August
1998, and the site evaluation field work was conducted in August 1999. A risk
assessment for the site is currently being performed. On March 9, 1999, the
Missouri Public Service Commission issued an Order authorizing us to defer the
costs associated with this site until March 9, 2001. A renewal of the Order has
been requested. The matter is still pending before the Commission.

     As of September 30, 2001, we had incurred costs of approximately $0.9
million for the investigations of the Johnson City and Bristol, Tennessee and
Hannibal, Missouri sites and had a remaining accrual relating to these sites of
$0.8 million.

  Mercury Contamination Sites

     We have completed investigation and remediation activities pursuant to
Consent Orders between the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and
United Cities Gas Company. The Orders provided for the investigation and
remediation of mercury contamination at gas pipeline sites which utilize or
formerly utilized mercury meter equipment in Kansas. The Final Interim
Characterization and Remediation Report has been submitted to the Kansas
Department of Health. We are currently in the process of amending the Orders
with the Kansas Department of Health to include all mercury meters that belonged
to our Greeley Gas Division before the merger with Untied Cites Gas Company on
July 31, 1997. These sites will be investigated and any necessary remediation
will be enforced. As of September 30, 2001, we had incurred costs of $0.1
million for these sites and had a remaining accrual of $0.3 million for
recovery. The Kansas Corporation Commission has authorized us to defer these
costs and seek recovery in a future rate case.

     We are a party to other environmental matters and claims, including those
discussed above, that arise out of our ordinary business. While the ultimate
results of response actions to these environmental matters and claims cannot be
predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such response actions
will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or net cash flows because we believe that the expenditures related to
such response actions will either be recovered through rates, shared with other
parties or covered by adequate insurance or reserves.

6.  COMMON STOCK AND STOCK OPTIONS

  SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN

     We have a Rights Agreement under which each right ("Right") will entitle
the holder thereof, until May 10, 2008 or the date of redemption of the Rights,
to buy one share of Common Stock of Atmos at the exercise price of $80.00,
subject to adjustment. At no time will the Rights have any voting rights. The
exercise price payable and the number of shares of Common Stock or other
securities or property issuable upon exercise of the Rights are subject to
adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution. At the date upon which the
rights become separate from our Common Stock (the "Distribution Date"), we will
issue one right with each share of Common Stock that becomes outstanding so that
all shares of Common Stock will have attached Rights. After the Distribution
Date, we may issue Rights when we issue Common Stock if the Board deems such
issuance to be necessary or appropriate.

occur upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Agreement,
including but not limited to, the acquisition by certain persons of at least 15
percent of the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock. The Rights have certain
anti-takeover effects and may cause substantial dilution to a person or entity
that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Board of
Directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon a substantial number of
Rights being acquired. The Rights should not interfere with any merger or other
business combination approved by the Board of Directors because, prior to the
time that the Rights become exercisable or transferable, the Rights may be
redeemed by us at $.01 per Right.

  RESTRICTED STOCK GRANT PLAN

     Our Restricted Stock Grant Plan for management and key employees of the
Company, which became effective October 1, 1987 and was amended and restated in
February 1998, provides for awards of common stock that are subject to certain
restrictions. The Restricted Stock Grant Plan is administered by the Board of
Directors. The members of the Board who are not employees of Atmos make the
final determinations regarding participation in the Plan, awards under the Plan
and restrictions on the restricted stock awarded. The restricted stock may
consist of previously issued shares purchased on the open market or shares
issued directly from us. During 1998, we increased the number of shares of our
common stock that may be issued under the Restricted Stock Grant Plan by 650,000
shares. Compensation expense of $1.1 million, $2.3 million and $1.6 million was
recognized in 2001, 2000 and 1999 in connection with the vesting of shares
awarded under the Plan.

  EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

     Prior to January 1, 1999, we had an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the
United Cities Gas Division had a 401(k) savings plan. The Employee Stock
Ownership Plan was amended effective January 1, 1999, as is more fully discussed
in Note 7.

  DIRECT STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

     We also have a Direct Stock Purchase Plan. Participants in the Direct Stock
Purchase Plan may have all or part of their dividends reinvested at a three
percent discount from market prices. Direct Stock Purchase Plan participants may
purchase additional shares of Atmos common stock as often as weekly with
voluntary cash payments of at least $25, up to an annual maximum of $100,000.

  OUTSIDE DIRECTORS STOCK-FOR-FEE PLAN

     In November 1994, the Board adopted the Outside Directors Stock-for-Fee
Plan which was approved by the shareholders of Atmos in February 1995 and was
amended and restated in November 1997. The plan permits non-employee directors
to receive all or part of their annual retainer and meeting fees in stock rather
than in cash.

  EQUITY INCENTIVE AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

     In November 1998, the Board adopted the Equity Incentive and Deferred
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors which was approved by the
shareholders of Atmos in February 1999. Such plan represents an amendment to the
Atmos Energy Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors
adopted by the Company on May 10, 1990 and replaced the pension payable under
the Company's Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Only non-employee
directors of Atmos are eligible to participate in the Equity Incentive and
Deferred Compensation Plan, the purpose of which is to provide non-employee
directors with the opportunity to defer receipt of compensation for services
rendered to the Company, invest deferred compensation into either a cash account
or a stock account and to receive an annual grant of share units for each year
of service on the Board.

  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

     We have two stock-based compensation plans that provide for the granting of
stock options to officers, key employees and non-employee directors. The
objectives of these plans include attracting and retaining the best personnel,
providing for additional performance incentives and promoting the success of
Atmos by providing employees the opportunity to acquire common stock.

  UNITED CITIES LONG-TERM STOCK PLAN

     Prior to the merger with Atmos, certain United Cities Gas Company officers
and key employees participated in the United Cities Long-Term Stock Plan
implemented in 1989. At the time of the merger on July 31, 1997, Atmos adopted
this plan by registering a total of 250,000 shares of Atmos stock to be issued
under the Long-Term Stock Plan for the United Cities Division. Under this plan,
incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock or any combination thereof may be granted to officers and key
employees of the United Cities Gas Division. Options granted under the plan
become exercisable at a rate of 20 percent per year and expire 10 years after
the date of grant. During 2001, 15,300 options were exercised under the plan. At
September 30, 2001, there were 19,300 options outstanding, all of which were
fully vested. No incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights or restricted stock have been granted under the plan since
1996. Because of the limited nature of this plan, the pro forma effects of
applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 would have less
than a $.01 per diluted share effect on earnings per share or approximately
$4,764, $8,580 and $30,852 for 2001, 2000 and 1999.

  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

     On August 12, 1998, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the 1998
Long-Term Incentive Plan, which became effective October 1, 1998 after approval
by the shareholders of Atmos. The Long Term Incentive Plan represents a part of
our Total Rewards strategy which we developed as a result of a study we
conducted of all employee, executive and non-employee director compensation and
benefits. The Long Term Incentive Plan is a comprehensive, long-term incentive
compensation plan providing for discretionary awards of incentive stock options,
non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, bonus stock, restricted
stock and performance-based stock to help attract, retain and reward employees
and non-employee directors of Atmos and its subsidiaries.

                            ATMOS ENERGY CORPORATION

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

     We are authorized to grant awards for up to a maximum of 1,500,000 shares
of common stock under the Long Term Incentive Plan subject to certain adjustment
provisions. The option price is equal to the market price of our stock at the
date of grant. The stock options expire 10 years from the date of the grant and
options vest annually over a service period ranging from one to three years. At
September 30, 2001, we had 1,009,330 options outstanding under the Long Term
Incentive Plan at an exercise price ranging from $14.68 to $25.66.

     In October 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," was issued. This statement
establishes a fair value-based method of accounting for employee stock options
or similar equity instruments and encourages, but does not require, all
companies to adopt that method of accounting for all of their employee stock
compensation plans. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 allows
companies to continue to measure compensation cost for employee stock options or
similar equity instruments using the intrinsic value method of accounting
described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees". We have elected to continue using the intrinsic value
method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board No. 25. Under this method no
compensation cost for stock options are recognized for stock option awards
granted at or above fair market value.

     A summary of activity for grants of stock options follows:

7.  EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT, STOCK OWNERSHIP AND OTHER PLANS

  DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

     Effective January 1, 1999, we established the Atmos Pension Account Plan
which covers substantially all employees of Atmos. Opening account balances were
established for participants as of January 1, 1999 equal to the present value of
their respective accrued benefits under the pension plans which were previously
in effect as of December 31, 1998. The Pension Account Plan credits an
allocation to each participant's account at the end of each year according to a
formula based on the participant's age, service and total pay (excluding
incentive pay).

     The Pension Account Plan also provides for an additional annual allocation
based upon a participant's age as of January 1, 1999 for those participants who
were participants in the prior pension plans. The plan will credit this
additional allocation each year through December 31, 2008. In addition, at the
end of each year, a participant's account will be credited with interest on the
employee's prior year account balance. A special grandfather benefit also
applies through December 31, 2008, for participants who were at least age 50 as
of January 1, 1999, and who were participants in one of the prior plans on
December 31, 1998. Participants are fully vested in their account balances after
five years of service and may choose to receive their account balances as a lump
sum or an annuity.

     Our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with
the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to
service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.

  SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE BENEFITS PLANS

     We have a nonqualified Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan which provides
additional pension, disability and death benefits to the officers and certain
other employees of Atmos. The Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan was amended
and restated in August 1998. In addition, in August 1998, we adopted the
Performance-Based Supplemental Executive Benefits Plan which covers all
employees who become officers or business unit presidents after August 12, 1998
or any other employees selected by our Board of Directors in its discretion.

  EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

     Atmos sponsors an Employee Stock Ownership Plan for substantially all
employees. Effective January 1, 1999 the Employee Stock Ownership Plan was
amended to provide for deferral of a portion of a participant's salary of up to
21 percent. In addition, among other changes to the Employee Stock Ownership
Plan, participants are provided with automatic matching contributions of 100
percent of each participant's salary reduction up to 4 percent of the
participant's salary and are provided the option of taking out loans against
their accounts subject to certain restrictions. Each participant enters into a
salary reduction agreement with Atmos pursuant to which the participant's salary
is reduced by an amount not more than 21 percent. Taxes on the amount by which
the participant's salary is reduced are deferred pursuant to Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code. The amount of the salary reduction is contributed by
us to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan for the account of the participant.
Matching contributions to the Plan were expensed as incurred and amounted to
$3.2 million, $3.0 million, and $2.4 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999. The
directors may also approve discretionary contributions, subject to the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and applicable regulations of
the Internal Revenue Service. No discretionary contributions were made for 2001,
2000, nor 1999.

  VARIABLE PAY PLAN

     The Variable Pay Plan was created to give each employee an opportunity to
share in the success of Atmos based on certain criteria. Each fiscal year, we
establish key performance measures for the Variable Pay Plan. These performance
measures are considered critical to achieving business objectives for a given
year and may include such things as growth in earnings, improved cash flows or
crucial customer satisfaction and safety results. Each year a performance
measure is established, and we make accruals during the year of the expected
pay-out based on the best estimates available at that time.

8.  OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

     Prior to January 1, 1999, Atmos sponsored two postretirement plans other
than pensions. Each provided health care benefits to retired employees. One
provided benefits to the United Cities Gas Division retirees and the other
provided medical benefits to all other retired Atmos employees.

     Effective January 1, 1999, the United Cities plan was merged into the Atmos
plan and began providing benefits to future retirees that are essentially the
same as provided to other Atmos employees.

     Substantially all of our employees become eligible for these benefits if
they reach retirement age while working for us and attain certain specified
years of service. In addition, participant contributions are required under the
plan.

     We record the accrued postretirement cost primarily in deferred credits and
other liabilities. The following table sets forth the total liability currently
recognized for the postretirement plan other than pensions for 2001 and 2000:

     We are currently recovering other postretirement benefits costs through our
regulated rates under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106
accrual accounting in Colorado, Kansas, the majority of the Texas service area
and Kentucky. We receive rate treatment as a cost of service item for other
postretirement benefits costs on the pay-as-you-go basis in Louisiana. Other
postretirement benefits costs have been specifically addressed in rate orders in
each jurisdiction served by the United Cities Gas Division or have been included
in a rate case and not disallowed. Management believes that accrual accounting
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 is
appropriate and will continue to seek rate recovery of accrual-based expenses in
its ratemaking jurisdictions that have not yet approved the recovery of these
expenses.

9.  EARNINGS PER SHARE

     Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income for the
period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income for
the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period adjusted for restricted stock and other contingently issuable shares
of common stock. Net income for the years ended September 30, 2001, 2000 and
1999 for basic and diluted earnings per share are the same, as there were no
contingently issuable shares of stock whose issuance would have impacted

purchase and the removal of the 45 percent equity investment we had in Woodward
Marketing which we had previously owned. Liabilities assumed in the acquisition
included $95.2 million in accounts payable, $0.5 million in customer deposits,
$7.3 million in other current liabilities and $0.8 million in deferred credits

11.  SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Our determination of reportable segments considers the strategic operating
units under which we manage sales of various products and services to customers
in differing regulatory environments. The accounting policies of the segments
are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting
policies. All intersegment sales prices are market based. We evaluate
performance based on net income or loss of the respective operating units.

     In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, we
have identified the Utility and Non-regulated segments, as described in Note 1.
We consider each business unit within our utility segment to be a reporting unit
of the utility segment and not a reportable segment. Our chief executive officer
makes decisions about allocating resources to the utility segment as a whole and
not to individual reporting units. The individual operations that comprise the
non-regulated segment are not currently material to our consolidated financial
position or results of operation and therefore do not require separate
reporting.

     Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is
shown in the following table:

     Consolidated lease and rental expense amounted to $5.9 million, $9.0
million and $10.6 million for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999. Rents for the
regulated business are expensed, and we receive rate treatment as a cost of
service on a pay-as-you-go basis.

14.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     Included in purchased gas cost were purchases from Woodward Marketing of
$525.6 million, $228.6 million and $117.4 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999.
Volumes purchased were 96.3 Bcf, 74.4 Bcf and 50.9 Bcf in 2001, 2000 and 1999.
These purchases were made in a competitive open bidding process and reflect
market prices. Average prices per Mcf for gas purchased from Woodward Marketing
were $5.46, $3.07 and $2.31 in 2001, 2000 and 1999. In addition, we have entered
into contracts with Woodward Marketing to manage a significant portion of our
underground storage facilities. Woodward Marketing has acted as agent in placing
financial instruments for the various business units that protect us and our
customers from unusually large winter period gas price increases.

15.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

     Effective October 1, 2000, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," as amended. This Statement establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that all
derivative financial instruments be recognized in the financial statements and
measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either
recognized periodically in income or as deferred gas costs, depending on the
classification of the derivative. Derivative instruments may be classified as
either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges. The cumulative effect of the
change in accounting for the adoption of this Statement did not have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

  WEATHER HEDGES AND INSURANCE

     In July 2000, we entered into an agreement to purchase weather hedges for
our Texas and Louisiana operations effective for the 2000-2001 heating season.
The hedges were designed to help mitigate the effects of weather that was at
least seven percent warmer than normal in both Texas and Louisiana while
preserving any upside. The cost of the weather hedges was approximately $4.9
million which was amortized over the 2000-2001 heating season.

     In June 2001, we purchased a three year weather insurance policy with an
option to cancel in the third year if we obtain weather protection in our rate
structures. The policy is for our Texas and Louisiana operations and covers the
entire heating season of October to March beginning with the 2001-2002 heating
season. The cost of the three year policy was approximately $13.2 million which
was prepaid and will be amortized over the appropriate heating seasons based on
degree days. The insurance is designed to protect against weather that is at
least seven percent warmer than normal.

  UTILITY HEDGING ACTIVITIES

     We have historically hedged 20 percent of our gas supply through the use of
our underground storage assets. This hedging process will continue. For the
2001-2002 heating season, we plan to cover approximately 64 percent of our
anticipated flowing gas requirements through storage and futures and fixed
forward contracts at a weighted average cost of slightly less than $4.00 per
Mcf. This should provide protection to us and our customers against sharp
increases in the price of natural gas during the 2001-2002 heating season.

16.  SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)

     Summarized unaudited quarterly financial data is presented below. The sum
of net income per share by quarter may not equal the net income per share for
the year due to variations in the weighted average shares outstanding used in
computing such amounts. Our businesses are seasonal due to weather conditions in
our service areas. For further information on its effects on quarterly results,
please see the "Weather and seasonality" discussion included in the
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" section herein.
