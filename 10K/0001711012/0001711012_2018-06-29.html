2017, the last business day of the registrant's most recently completed second fiscal quarter, there was no established public
market for the registrant&rsquo;s common stock and, therefore, the registrant cannot calculate the aggregate market value of its
voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates as of such date. The aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting
common stock held by non-affiliates computed by reference to the price at which the common stock was last sold as of June 28, 2018,
was approximately $78,424,525. Common stock held by each officer and director and by each person known to the registrant who owned
10% or more of the outstanding voting and non-voting common stock have been excluded in that such persons may be deemed to be affiliates.
This determination of affiliate status is not necessarily a conclusive determination for other purposes.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">We are an online lending platform in China
connecting Chinese investors with individual and small-to-medium-sized enterprise (&quot;SME&quot;) borrowers. Through our platform,
we offer quick and easy access to credit to borrowers and attractive investment returns for investors. Since the acquisition of
our platform in September&nbsp;2016, which is more fully described below, through March 31, 2018, we have facilitated loans (including
assigned loans) with an aggregate of principal of over RMB 579 million (approximately US$89 million). As of March 31, 2018, we
had a total of 3,372 investors, 2,558 borrowers and two creditor partners had participated in loan transactions through our platform.
We currently conduct our business operations exclusively in China, and all of our investors and borrowers are located in China.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Our online platform enables us to
efficiently match borrowers with investors and execute loan transactions. We seek to address an unmet investor and borrower
demand in China. While presently our borrowers mainly come from referrals from financial institutions and business partners,
our investors come from a variety of channels, including internet and our mobile applications, promotion through our own
business development department as well as referrals from our business partners.</P>

of 40,044 registered users. We interact with registered users of our platform on a regular basis. We post articles of third parties
related to investment and wealth management on our platform for our registered users. Information in these materials may potentially
be used by registered users on our platform for their investment decisions, including investment in loans posted on our platform.
All registered users of our platform have access to loans posted on our platform and can forward the loan posting to individuals
in their network. Any of these users and their connections can invest in loans posted on our website if they are willing to.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Historically, we offered two types of products:
standard loans and assignment of loans, providing qualified borrowers with convenient access to affordable credit at competitive
prices and creditors with a fast and cost-efficient way to assign their existing loans for more liquidity. Our investors have
the option to individually select specific loans to invest in or to use our automated investing tool that identifies and selects
loans on the basis of an investor targeted return and risk tolerance.</P>

platform are unsecured, feature fixed interest rate and have terms ranging from one to 36 months. We generate revenues primarily
from fees charged for facilitating loan transactions on our platform. We charge borrowers transaction fees based on the loan amounts
for services provided through our platform. Our current transaction fees range from 4.14% to 6.14% of the loan amount for borrowers.
The transaction fees are paid (i) upon disbursement of the proceeds for loans accruing interest on a monthly basis and (ii) upon
full payment of principal and interest of loans accruing interest on a daily basis. We also charge our investors a service fee
of 8.00% of their actual investment return and the service fee is paid when the investors receive their interest payment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">We were incorporated in the State of Nevada
on June 8, 2017. We have established a wholly owned subsidiary, Sichuan Senmiao Zecheng Business Consulting Co., Ltd. (&quot;WFOE,&quot;
or &quot;Senmiao Consulting&quot;) in China. Substantially all of our business activities are undertaken by WFOE and a variable
interest entity (&quot;VIE&quot;), Sichuan Senmiao Ronglian Technology Co., Ltd. (&quot;Sichuan Senmiao&quot;) in China. As of
the date of this Report, the WFOE only provides services to Sichuan Senmiao, our VIE entity, pursuant to our VIE agreements. We
anticipate that the WFOE will conduct a major portion of our research, development and marketing activities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Sichuan Senmiao was established in China
in June 2014. The equity interest of Sichuan Senmiao is owned by 9 individuals in the PRC (see the corporate structure diagram
below for details). As of February&nbsp;26, 2018, purchase price for all equity transfers has been fully paid and the transfers
have been completed. We have entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Sichuan Senmiao and each of its equity holders
through WFOE to obtain control and become the primary beneficiary of Sichuan Senmiao. The contractual arrangements have been in
place since the establishment of WFOE (the &quot;Restructuring&quot;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">On September&nbsp;25, 2016, Sichuan Senmiao
acquired a peer-to-peer platform (including website, internet content provider (&quot;ICP&quot;) registration, operating systems,
servers, management system, employees and users) (the &ldquo;Aihongsen platform&rdquo;) from Sichuan Chenghexin Investment and
Asset Management Co., Ltd. (&quot;Chenghexin&quot;), who had established and operated the platform for two years prior to our acquisition
(the &quot;Acquisition&quot;), for an initial payment of RMB 60 million (approximately US$8.9 million) with the remaining payment
to be confirmed upon completion of an appraisal of the platform. On March&nbsp;26, 2017, the parties signed a supplement agreement
to the purchase agreement whereby they confirmed the remaining payment based on the appraisal report. We paid a total cash consideration
of RMB 69,690,000 (approximately US$10.1 million) for the platform.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Prior to the Acquisition, Sichuan Senmiao
was a holding company that owned a 60% equity interest in an equity investment fund management company. Sichuan Senmiao sold its
60% equity interest for a cash consideration of RMB 60 million (approximately US$8.9 million) immediately following the Acquisition,
in order to focus on the online marketplace lending business.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Consumption in China is growing rapidly but
remains underfinanced, suggesting significant growth potential for China's consumer finance market.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Consumption in China has experienced rapid
growth as a result of China's economic development and rising consumption power among Chinese consumers. According to the World
Bank, China's GDP increased from US$7.6 trillion in 2011 to US$10.1 trillion in 2015, while annual per capita disposable income
increased from US$5,634 in 2011 to US$8,069 in 2015. Consumption has increasingly become an important driver of China's GDP growth,
with the ratio of final consumption to GDP reaching 51.1% in 2015, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. &quot;Final
consumption&quot; is the total expenditure of residents on the consumption of goods and services in a certain period, namely the
expenditure of residents for purchases of goods and services from the domestic economic territory and abroad to meet the requirements
of their daily life, and excludes the expenditure of non-residents on consumption in the economic territory of the country. While
China's ratio of final consumption to GDP in 2015 was 51.1%, it was still relatively low compared to the corresponding figure for
the U.S. in the same period, which was 82.5% according to the World Bank, suggesting tremendous future potential. We believe the
United States, which is characterized by high levels of consumption and high consumption loan balance to GDP ratios, provides a
good proxy for the way China may develop given the growth of China's economy, China's large and expanding consumer base and the
Chinese government's policies to encourage consumption. As consumption in China continues to rise, we believe China's consumer
finance market will develop to address unmet consumer demand.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Despite growing consumption levels, consumption
in China is underfinanced primarily because loans from traditional financial institutions are not easily accessible. For example,
to obtain a bank loan, a potential borrower needs to physically go to a bank branch. However, most bank branches offering consumption
loans are located only in tier 1 and tier 2 cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. In addition, the application process
for a bank loan is complex and time-consuming. The perceived ineffectiveness of traditional financial institutions at serving
the consumer finance market potentially suggests business opportunities for alternative credit providers. According to iResearch
Consulting Group, a market research and marking company in China (&quot;iResearch&quot;), China's consumption loan exceeded RMB
22 trillion (approximately US$3.4 trillion) in 2016 and is expected to further grow to RMB 40.1 trillion (approximately US$6.2
trillion) by 2020. The development of new financial services and products will be one of the key growth drivers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The consumer finance
market consists of secured consumption loans such as car loans and home mortgages, and unsecured consumption loans such as credit
cards and other unsecured loans from banks and consumer financing companies. China's credit balance in 2015 was RMB 93.6 trillion
(approximately US$14.4 trillion), representing an increase of 14.9% from the prior year. Unsecured consumption loans are expected
to exhibit relatively stronger growth. According to a report issued by iResearch, China's consumption loan balance had reached
RMB 19 trillion (approximately US$2.9 trillion) by the end of 2015, and is expected to reach RMB 41.1 trillion (approximately
US$6.3 trillion) by the end of 2019. Key drivers behind the expected growth in China's unsecured consumer finance market include
the penetration of consumer finance into more consumption categories, the continued development of a nationwide personal credit
information database, which improves the ability of lenders to evaluate potential borrower risk, and credit providers' increasing
awareness of the business opportunity in the sector.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">We believe China's rapidly growing consumption
levels and relatively limited consumer finance options have created opportunities for marketplaces that connect borrowers and
investors. According to iResearch, transaction values for marketplaces that focus on consumption loans, or consumer finance marketplaces,
are expected to grow from RMB 436.7 billion (approximately US$522.9 billion) in 2016 to RMB 3.4 trillion (approximately US$67.2
billion) in 2019, representing a compound annual growth rate of 98.2%. The primary drivers for the growth of consumer finance
marketplaces include the growing consumption market and increasing demand for consumer finance. In addition, it is also driven
by consumers' need for higher borrowing limits and convenient transaction processing, and improved credit assessment capabilities
made possible through the application of big data analytics.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Additional drivers for the growth of online
consumer finance marketplaces include increased internet and mobile penetration among consumers, the emergence of online marketplaces
and ecommerce platforms that drive consumer behavior from offline to online, as well as the ability to realize comparatively lower
user acquisition costs and higher operating efficiencies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The online lending marketplace industry in
China is intensely competitive and we compete with many other peer-to-peer marketplaces. According to the China Peer-to-Peer Industry
Report for 2016 (the &quot;P2P Report&quot;) issued by Lingyi Research Center, an independent research institution, there were
approximately 4,856 peer-to-peer lending marketplaces in China as of December 2016. The number of platforms increased to 5,229
as of July 2017. In light of the low barriers to entry in the peer-to-peer lending industry in China, we expect more players to
enter this market and increase the level of competition.</P>

of lending platforms, the peer-to-peer lending market in China has been subject to risky lending practices (such as over-leveraging)
and platform failures. According to the P2P Report, as of December 2016, 3,201 platforms (or 65.9%) had the above referenced issues,
21 of which were located in Sichuan. Among these problematic platforms, 433 platforms (or 39.2%) closed and 395 platform (or 35.7%)
suspended their operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">In response to the ongoing platform failures
and continuous risky lending practices, the PRC government has increased its regulation of peer-to-peer lending since 2015. The
most significant regulation is the Interim Measures for the Administration of Business Activities of Online Lending Information
Intermediaries (the &quot;Interim Measures&quot;). The Interim Measures set forth the upper limit for borrowing amounts of individuals
and entities from one platform and the upper limit for aggregate borrowing amounts of each type of these borrowers from all peer-to-peer
lending platforms within one year. Recent regulatory developments have facilitated operational adjustments that we expect will
improve lending practices on peer-to-peer platforms in China. In order to comply with the Interim Measures, peer-to-peer lending
companies are adjusting various aspects of their operations, including loans offered on their platforms and risk management programs.
One of the significant trends since the Interim Measures became effective is the transition to smaller loans. The Interim Measures
also require lending platforms to use banks as custodian. As a result, lending platforms are switching to bank custodians. According
to Lingyi Research Center, as of December 2016, 227 platforms signed depository agreements with custodian banks.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">In light of the increased regulations, the
number of peer-to-peer lending platforms entering the market has been decreasing since mid-2016. According to Lingyi Research Center,
approximately 38 lending platforms entered into the market in July 2016 and the number decreased to 8 in December 2016. For more

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Our platform was one of the early online
lending platforms in Sichuan province. From the Acquisition of our platform through March 31, 2018, our platform successfully
facilitated loans (including loan assignments) between 2,089 investors, 2,406 borrowers and two creditors, representing an aggregate
value of approximately RMB 579 million (approximately US$89 million). We are also leveraging our relationship with Resgreen Group,
a direct selling company based in Changsha, China, with over a million members, to jointly promote our products and services to
their business partners and members. We are aiming to position ourselves as a leading online consumer finance platform for the
direct selling industry in the PRC. We believe our scale, brand, risk management capabilities and technology platform allow us
to effectively attract new participants, lower costs for our users, provide high-quality loan investment opportunities, create
higher liquidity and thus reinforce our market position. As of the date of this Report, there are approximately 35 lending platforms
in Sichuan province. The Company's primary competitors in Sichuan include Sichuan Jinding Wealth Information Technology Co., Ltd.
(&quot;Jinding Wealth&quot;), Koudai Network Services Co., Ltd., Chengdu Hongxue Jinxin Business Consulting Co., Ltd. and Chengdu
Zhongke E-Commerce Co., Ltd. Although some of these companies, such as Jinding Wealth, are established lending platforms with
large and existing borrower and investor bases as well as substantial financial resources, compared to these lending platforms,
we believe that our sophisticated custodian system and compatibility with current PRC regulations will make us more attractive
to both borrowers and investors. Based on information available on the websites of our competitors as well as www.wdzj.com, an
independent third party website that focuses on the P2P lending industry in China, we believe we are the first non-state owned
lending platform in Sichuan that has established a custodian system with a depository bank pursuant to the requirements of applicable
PRC regulations. We set up our custodian system in February of 2017 while most of our competitors were either negotiating their
agreements with custodian banks or were (or remain) in the process of transitioning to the custodian system operated by their
depository banks. In addition, loan transactions on our platform comply with restrictions on aggregate loan amounts for individual
borrowers and entities set forth in PRC regulations while our competitors are in the process of restructuring loans on their platforms
to comply with such requirement.</P>

we acquired approximately 22,654 new users through referrals from Resgreen Group, of which approximately 471 had invested through
our platform while none of them had borrowed. With the increase in the number of new users from our partnership with Resgreen Group,
we are able to effectively lower our user acquisition costs as compared to traditional user acquisition channels because we have
been able to precisely market our platform to a large number of potential users with relevant low marketing expenses. Pursuant
to our strategic cooperation agreement with Resgreen Group, we have the right to participate in all meetings Resgreen Group organizes
for its members, at which we can promote our brand and services and attract Resgreen members. Once these Resgreen members become
registered users of our platform, they can potentially become borrowers and investors on our platform. We have agreed to provide
Resgreen members access to our platform where they can view investment opportunities and information related to wealth management
posted on our platform. Resgreen has also agreed to provide to us information regarding their members, including members' basic
information as well as sales and financial data of each member within the Resgreen direct sale network. We plan to develop targeted
marketing strategies towards Resgreen members by analyzing such data. We have agreed to provide Resgreen Group our analysis of
their members' information. Our business relationship with Resgreen Group is strategic rather than economic by its nature. Resgreen

We acquire our borrowers mostly through referrals from financial institutions such as banks, micro-lending companies and guarantee
companies due to the differences between these institutions' operation model, product offering and targeted customer and our own.
These institutions refer borrowers to us if they believe that our platform and loans offered on our platform better serve the borrowers'
needs for financing. For example, guaranty companies are not allowed to extend loans, so they refer borrowers to us and they may
serve as guarantors in such transactions for services fees, while banks in China focus on traditional large scale standardized
loan products and they do not typically serve our targeted market. The borrowers they refer to us are generally looking for short-term
financings below RMB 1,000,000 (approximately US$153,782) to fund their cash flow requirement. We are not obligated to pay any
fees to any of these institutions and have not paid any referral fees as of the date of this Report. We also acquire borrowers
through our own marketing efforts such as event promotions, online marketing, user meetings and sales support. For the year ended
March 31, 2018, we have facilitated loans to over 2,369 borrowers with an aggregate principal amount of approximately RMB 529 million

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Prior to 2018, our platform was also accessible
to creditors (&quot;Creditor Partners&quot;) who had extended loans to borrowers outside our platform (&quot;Outside Loans&quot;).
We provided our Creditor Partners the ability to assign their creditor's rights under the Outside Loans to obtain interim financing
before loan maturities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">We would review and evaluate a Creditor Partner's
financial conditions and credit profiles and make a determination if they would meet our minimum requirements for listing the Outside
Loans on our platform. We would re-evaluate these partners' credit status from time to time, usually on a monthly basis. Once the
Creditor Partner was approved, we would categorize the partner's credit facility into one or more of the loan products and post
their loans on our platform. Investors would then have access to information regarding the original borrower, the loans being assigned,
the collateral or guaranty securing the loans and other details related to the assigned loans. Our Creditor Partners were required
to repurchase the Outside Loans at the end of the assignment term.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The Creditor Partners had conducted their
own due diligence on the original borrower's creditworthiness for the Outside Loans when they originally made these loans. Our
risk control department also would conduct its own due diligence on the creditor's rights sought to be assigned and the original
borrower's credit-worthiness, applying the same standards we use to review borrowers for direct loans. As part of this process,
our risk control department would review the loan contract between the Creditor Partner and the original borrower to determine
whether the original borrower had agreed to the proposed assignment of creditor's rights. We would then directly contact the original
borrower to ensure that they had received notice of proposed assignment from the Creditor Partner.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">When our Creditor Partners assigned Outside
Loans to investors on our platform, all rights of the Creditor Partners were assigned to the investors. Borrowers under the Outside
Loans would remain legally obligated to pay off the assigned Outside Loans. Existing guarantors of the Outside Loan would remain
legally obligated to perform their obligations under the assigned loans. Neither we nor the Creditor Partner would have any obligation
to repay the assigned loan or provide a payment guarantee.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">For this service, we charged our Creditor
Partners service fees ranging from 0.32%-0.94% of the assigned loan principal. For the year ended March 31, 2018, the term of
assignment of the loans averaged 28 days and the size of the loans assigned on our platform during this period was $36,281 on
average.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Each Creditor Partner had a maximum amount of outstanding loan assignments permitted on our platform (&quot;Total Assignment
Cap&quot;) that was approved by our loan assessment committee when we approved the Creditor Partner. The Total Assignment Cap
was RMB 50 million (approximately US$7.7 million) for each of our Creditor Partners prior to our discontinuation of the assigned
loan products.</P>

our relationships with prior creditors, whom we referred to as business partners due to change of business model, we signed cooperation
agreements with them pursuant to which they would refer their customers with financing needs to our platform. Pursuant to the cooperation
agreements, we sent our employees to the office of our business partners and such employees would collect and review loan application
materials from our business partners' customers who would like to seek financing through out platform and verify their identity,
credit and financial conditions based on our standards. Our business partners would also collect, review and assess loan application

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Our business partners would pay for the transaction
fees on behalf of their customers when the loans transactions of their customers are concluded. Specifically, the transaction fees
for loans accruing interest on a monthly basis are paid upon disbursement of loan proceeds and the transaction fees for loans accruing

by business partners varied based on the amount of business our business partners refer to us and the default risk of borrowers
referred, ranging from 0.30% to 2.98% of the loan amounts.</P>

would guarantee the payment of the loans. They are parties to the loan transaction documents and would be jointly and severally
liable for the payment of the loans, including principal, interest, penalties, and other fees associated with collection of the
loans. In addition, to further secure the loan transaction, we sometimes would require a business partner to provide a security
deposit for each referred loan transaction. The security deposit would be used to pay back the investors when the referred borrower
failed to pay principal and interest in time and the business partner would need to deposit additional funds to ensure sufficient
funds at required level.</P>

guidelines and also as part of our preparation for our record &ndash;filing under the new marketplace lending regulations and as
requested by the local finance bureau in connection with their inspection of our operations, we ceased our cooperation with business

loan proceeds for loans accruing interest on a monthly basis and upon full payment of principal and interest of loans accruing
interest on a daily basis. We recognize revenues generated from transaction fees when the loan transactions are closed and invoices
for such fees are issued. The interest rate and transaction fee represent the total cost of borrowing for borrowers. A penalty
fee for late payment is imposed as a percentage of the amount past due and will be paid to the investors should a default occur.
All fees are clearly disclosed to the borrowers. As of the date of this Report, we have not collected any penalty for late payment
because there has not been any default or delinquencies since we acquired the Aihongsen platform.</P>

opportunity to invest in a range of loan products with attractive returns. We provide our investors with an automated investing
tool with which an investor can invest a specified amount of money to borrowers or previously our Creditor Partners through our
platform for a specified period of time. Once an investor commits funds to invest, the funds are automatically allocated among
approved borrowers. Our automated investing tool automatically reinvests investors' funds as long as there are sufficient funds
in the investor's account, enabling investors to automatically reinvest without having to continually revisit our website or mobile
application. Investors using our automated investing tool are allowed to withdraw their funds before a loan is fully subscribed.
During the fiscal year ended March&nbsp;31, 2018, over 70% of the funds invested by investors through our platform were invested
utilizing this automated investing tool.</P>

invested through our automated investing tool by each investor was approximately RMB 24,404 (approximately US$3,753). The rate
of return offered to an investor after deducting the management fee varies with the duration of the investment term. Currently,

process for borrowers and investors alike. The entire process from initial application to disbursement of funds on average takes
approximately 20 days for direct loans and approximately one day for loan assignments. With respect to loan assignments, the initial

would generally take a day as the Creditor Partners had been pre-approved and our review would involve less documents and procedures.
Our initial review and approval of our business partners would generally take a month but the approval of loans to borrowers referred

the submission of a loan application by a prospective borrower. Borrowers can apply through our website or mobile applications.
As part of the application process, the prospective borrower is asked to provide various personal and business details. The specific
personal and business details required will depend upon the borrower's desired loan product, but typically include PRC identity
card information, employer information, bank account information, credit card information and a credit Report from the PBOC. For
business, they will need business registration certificate, tax certificate, financial report, bank statements and credit report
from the People's Bank of China (the &quot;PBOC&quot;). Our borrowers are also required to designate the use of loan proceeds in
their loan applications. After loan proceeds are disbursed, we will follow up with telephone calls to confirm such designated use
of proceeds. However, due to the lack of detailed regulations, implementation measures and guidance on regulations concerning our
industry, it is unclear what measures are required to verify the use of proceeds. We believe our current practice is sufficient

we would re-evaluate these partners' creditability from time to time, usually on a monthly basis.</P>

into a loan agreement with respect to borrowers or a loan assignment and repurchase agreement in the case of a loan assignment

in the case of a loan assignment and repurchase agreement, among the Creditor Partner, the investor(s), guarantors and our platform,
or in the case of a loan transaction through referral by our business partner, among the investor, borrower, the business partner
and its affiliates and our platform. Upon a borrower's or Creditor Partner's acceptance of the loan documents, the loan or the
Outside Loan is then listed on our platform for investors to view. Once a loan or an Outside Loan assignment is listed on our platform,
investors may then subscribe to the loan or the Outside Loan using our automated or self-directed investing tools. We also make
available a security agreement that enables our investors to take a security interest in the borrower's collateral or a guaranty
whereby the guarantor will be jointly and severally liable for the payment of loans. Except in the case of referral through our
business partners where we enter into a Finance Intermediary Service Contract with our business partners with respect to each borrower
referred, we enter into such contract directly with each borrower prior to the disbursement of the loan proceeds. The contract
provides for the services fees we will charge the borrower to facilitate the loan transaction on our platform as well as the rights

two types of collateral for loans facilitated and assigned through our platform. As part of our risk management program, we would
first examine the value of the real estate to be used as collateral and then record the collateralization with local real estate
bureau if such registration was allowed by PRC real estate laws and regulations. If such registration was not feasible under applicable
PRC laws and regulations, we would require the property owner reflected in the real estate registry to guarantee the loan. Automobiles
used to be collateral for loans assigned from one of our Creditor Partners and the loans with borrowers referred by our business
partners. The Creditor Partner had completed the collateralization process prior to the loan assignment. When such loans were
assigned to investors on our platform, these investors would have the right of the Creditor Partner with regard to the collateral.</P>

a Total Assignment Cap and specific guidelines on the review and approval of subsequent loan assignments. Our risk management team

government agency's open database to check their identity card numbers against known criminals and third party companies' credit

We changed our custodian bank to XW Bank on April 8, 2018 because peer-to-peer lending platforms in Sichuan Province are required

our depository business to one commercial bank, and sign or amend implementation agreements to the extent necessary. As a result,
we ceased our business relationships with third party payment agents and engaged Guangdong Huaxing Bank, which was replaced by

growth of our platform, we seek to mitigate the risks inherent in expanding credit markets. To this end, we strive to follow industry
best practices for all aspects of our business, including credit risk management and analysis, operational transparency, and data
security. In March&nbsp;2017, we partnered with Guangdong Huaxing Bank to provide fund depository services for our platform, pursuant
to which Guangdong Huaxing Bank set up separate accounts for our borrowers and investors, and assumed fund depository functions
including settlement, accounting and safeguard of online lending capital. Through this arrangement, Guangdong Huaxing Bank acted
as a third-party custody and settlement arrangement to better protect our users. The custodian bank was changed from Guangdong
Huaxing Bank to XW Bank on April 8, 2018. In addition, we have been issued the Level III Certification of Information System Security
issued by MPS in March&nbsp;2017.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Direct selling companies typically have a
large number of loyal members. Our partnership with direct selling companies enable us to conduct accurate direct marketing and
effectively reduce our user acquisition costs. We have partnered with Resgreen Group, which has over a million members, to jointly
promote our products and services to their business partners and members. As of the date of this Report, Resgreen Group is the
only direct selling company we have an agreement with although we plan to develop partnerships with other direct selling companies
in the future. For the year ended March 31, 2018, we acquired approximately 22,654 new users through our partnership with Resgreen
Group, of which users approximately 471 had invested through our platform. For year ended March 31, 2018, 56.57% of our new users
are members of Resgreen Group. We anticipate that our reliance on Resgreen Group will decrease as we continue to expand our borrower
and investor base.</P>

our online platform through the introduction of new credit products and services. By tailoring products to specific borrower needs,
we continually seek to attract new and repeat borrowers to our platform. We plan to leverage our relationship with prior creditors
such as automobile distributors, to expand our cooperation with more similar businesses or in new industries. By targeting specific
borrower segments with specialized loan products, we intend to increase the conversion rate of interested individuals into successfully
qualified borrowers. In the future, we expect repeat borrowers to become an increasingly important source of our borrower base
and we will design specific products and services to cater to this group. In addition, we will continue to leverage new technologies,
such as mobile applications, to make the borrower loan application and investor matching process more efficient and transparent,
attracting more borrowers to our platform. As consumers in China become increasingly receptive to utilizing online consumer financial
services in general, we believe the improvements to our platform will enable us to increase our user base.</P>

to expand our ability to offer risk-based loan pricing. For example, we may adopt risk-based pricing for borrowers based on individual
credit criteria so that borrowers will be able to receive customized loans tailored to their own credit profile. In addition, we
intend to introduce market-based pricing of loans based on macroeconomic factors and we believe such ability to continually adjust
the pricing of the loans on our platform will allow us to better meet the needs of our borrowers.</P>

capabilities of our credit and risk management systems. We expect the online system to be implemented by the third quarter of 2018.
In addition, we will continue to strengthen our off-line risk management team which verify borrowers' risk profile on the ground.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The online finance marketplace industry
in China is intensely competitive and we compete with other finance marketplaces. While there are over 1,700 other operating marketplace
lending platforms and peer-to-peer lenders in China, we believe we do not directly compete with most of these marketplaces and
peer-to-peer lenders because, unlike these other marketplaces and peer-to-peer lenders, our market segment is different as we
target the direct selling industry and we believe we are currently the only peer-to-peer lending platform servicing direct selling
companies. &nbsp;Additionally, we anticipate that more established internet, technology and financial services companies that
possess large, existing user bases, substantial financial resources and established distribution channels may enter the market
in the future. We believe that our unique industry focus, diversified loan product offerings, lower investment thresholds and
marketplace dynamics make us more attractive and efficient to both borrowers and investors, providing us with a competitive advantage.
In light of the low barriers to entry in the online finance industry, more players may enter this market and increase the level
of competition.</P>

finance companies. We believe our innovative marketplace model and online platform enable us to operate more efficiently and with
higher levels of borrower satisfaction than these competitors. With respect to investors, we primarily compete with other investment

that our sophisticated custodian system and compatibility with current PRC regulations will make us more attractive to both borrowers
and investors. Based on information available on our competitors' websites as well as third party sources, we believe we were the
first non-state owned lending platform in Sichuan that has established a custodian system with a depository bank pursuant to the
requirements of applicable PRC regulations. We set up our custodian system in February of 2017 while most of our competitors were
either negotiating their agreements with custodian banks or are in the process of transitioning to the custodian system operated
by their depository banks. In addition, loan transactions on our platform comply with restrictions on aggregate loan amounts for
individual borrowers and businesses set forth in PRC regulations while our competitors are in the process of restructuring loans

(the &quot;Guidelines&quot;), which identified the CBRC as the supervisory regulator for the online lending industry. According
to the Guidelines, online marketplace lending platforms shall only serve as intermediaries to provide information services to borrowers
and investors, and shall not provide credit enhancement services or illegally conduct fundraising. The Guidelines also outlined
certain regulatory propositions, which would require Internet finance companies, including marketplace lending platforms, to (i)
complete website registration procedures with the administrative departments overseeing telecommunications; (ii) use banking financial
institutions' depository accounts to hold lending capital, and engage an independent auditor to audit such accounts and publish
audit results to customers; (iii) improve the disclosure of operational and financial information, provide sufficient risk disclosure,
and set up thresholds for qualified investors to provide better protections to investors; (iv) enhance online security management
to protect customers' personal and transactional information; and (v) take measures against anti-money laundering and other financial
crimes.</P>

Provisions of the Supreme People's Court on Application of Laws to the Hearing of Private Lending Cases (the &quot;Provisions on

The Provisions set forth that private lending contracts will be upheld as invalid under the circumstance that (i) relending of
funds to a borrower that knew or should have known that the funds were fraudulently obtained from a financial institution; (ii)
relending of funds to a borrower that knew or should have known that the funds were borrowed from other enterprises or raised by

intended to use the borrowed funds for illegal or criminal purposes; (iv) violations of public orders or good morals; or (v) violations

the People's Court will uphold the interest rate charged by the investor, and (ii) when the interest rate agreed between the borrower
and investor exceeds an annual interest rate of 36%, the portion in excess of 36% is void and the People's Court will uphold the
borrower's claim for return of the excess portion to the borrower. For loans with interest rates per annum between 24% and 36%,
if the interest on the loans has already been paid to the investor, and so long as such payment has not damaged the interest of
the state, the community or any third parties, the courts will likely not enforce the borrower's demand for the return of such
interest payment. If an interest rate for overdue payments is not agreed to before lending, the interest rate on overdue payments
is permitted up to the interest rate for the loan. If neither the interest rate for the loan nor the interest rate for overdue

of Online Lending Information Intermediaries (the &quot;Guidance of Administration&quot;), which provides the general filing rules
for online lending intermediaries, and delegates the filing authority to local financial authorities. The Guidance of Administration
sets forth that online lending intermediaries are filed locally. Under the general filing procedures for online lending intermediaries
which had already been established and operated prior to the promulgation of the Guidance of Administration, before an filing application
is submitted to local financial regulators, the online lending intermediaries may be required to: (i) rectify any breach of applicable
regulations as required by local financial regulators; and (ii) apply to the Industry and Commerce Administration Department to

depositories shall not be engaged in offering any guarantee, including: (i) offering guarantees for lending transaction activities

intermediaries, including requiring them to enter into fund depository agreements with only one commercial bank to provide fund
depository services, organize independent auditing on funds depository accounts of borrowers and investors and various other services.
The Depository Guidance also provides that online lending intermediaries permitted to develop an online lending fund depository
business shall satisfy certain conditions, including: (i) completing registration, filing records and obtaining a business license
from the Industry and Commerce Administration Department; (ii) filing records with the local financial regulator; and (iii) applying

Depository Guidance also requires online lending intermediaries to perform various obligations, and prohibits them advertising
their services with the information of their depository except for in accordance with necessary exposure requirements, the interpretation
and applicability of which is unclear, as well as oversight requirements. The Depository Guidance also raises other business standards

microcredit companies, banking financial institutions and online lending information intermediaries. Circular 141 specifies the
features of&thinsp;&quot;cash loans&quot; as not relying on consumption scenarios, with no specified use of loan proceeds, no qualification
requirement on customers and unsecured etc. Circular 141 sets forth several general requirements with respect to &quot;cash loan&quot;

approvals for the lending business; (ii) the aggregated borrowing costs of borrowers charged by institutions in the forms of interest
and various fees should be annualized and subject to the limit on interest rate of private lending set forth in the Private Lending

service provider in the facilitation of loans between borrowers and investors, our platform has not been subject to any fines or
other penalties under any PRC laws and regulations that prohibit illegal fundraising. In this regard, as advised by our PRC counsel,
the business operation of our platform does not violate the current existing PRC laws and regulations prohibiting illegal fundraising.
Nevertheless, uncertainties exist with respect to the PBOC, AIC and other governmental authorities' interpretations of the fundraising-related
laws and regulations. While our agreements with investors require investors to guarantee the legality of all funds investors put
on our platform, we do not verify the source of investors' funds separately, and therefore, to the extent that investors' funds
are obtained through illegal fundraising, we may be negligently liable as a facilitator of illegal fundraising. In addition, while
our loan agreements contain provisions that require borrowers to use the proceeds for purposes listed in their loan applications,
we do not monitor the borrowers' use of funds on an on-going basis, and therefore, to the extent that borrowers use proceeds from
the loans for illegal activities, we may be negligently liable as a facilitator of an illegal use. Although we have designed and
implemented procedures to identify and eliminate instances of fraudulent conduct on our platform, as the number of borrowers and
investors on our platform increases, we may not be able to identify all fraudulent conduct that may violate illegal fundraising
laws and regulations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The establishment, operation and management
of corporate entities in China is governed by the Company Law of the PRC (the &quot;Company Law&quot;). According to the Company
Law, companies established in the PRC are either limited liability companies or joint stock limited liability companies. The Company
Law applies to both PRC domestic companies and foreign-invested companies. The establishment procedures, approval procedures, registered
capital requirements, foreign exchange matters, accounting practices, taxation and labor matters of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise
are regulated by the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law of the PRC and the Implementation Regulation of the Wholly Foreign-owned
Enterprise Law. According to these regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may only pay dividends out of their accumulated
profit, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. A PRC company is required to set aside
general reserves of at least 10% of its after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of its registered
capital unless the provisions of laws regarding foreign investment provide otherwise. In addition, PRC companies may allocate a
portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to employee welfare and bonus funds at their discretion. These
reserves and employee welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends. A PRC company may not distribute any profits
until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together
with distributable profits from the current fiscal year. In September&nbsp;2016, the National People's Congress Standing Committee
published its decision to revise the laws relating to wholly foreign-owned enterprises and other foreign-invested enterprises.
Such decision, which became effective on October&nbsp;1, 2016, changes the &quot;filing or approval&quot; procedure for foreign
investments in China such that foreign investments in business sectors not subject to special administrative measures will only
be required to complete a filing instead of the existing requirements to apply for approval. The special entry management measures
shall be promulgated or approved to be promulgated by the State Council. Pursuant to a notice issued by the National Development
and Reform Commission (&quot;NDRC&quot;) and the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China (&quot;MOFCOM&quot;) on
October&nbsp;8, 2016, the special entry management measures shall be implemented with reference to the relevant regulations as
stipulated in the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment in relation to the restricted foreign investment industries,
prohibited foreign investment industries and encouraged foreign investment industries. Pursuant to the Provisional Administrative
Measures on Establishment and Modifications Filing for Foreign Investment Enterprises promulgated by MOFCOM on October&nbsp;8,
2016, establishment and changes of foreign investment enterprises not subject to the approval under the special entry management
measures shall be filed with the relevant commerce authorities.</P>

of Foreign Investment and the 2015 revision of the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment classify foreign investment
projects into four categories: encouraged projects, permitted projects, restricted projects and prohibited projects. The purpose
of these regulations is to direct foreign investment into certain priority industry sectors and restrict or prohibit investment
in other sectors. If the industry sector in which the investment is to occur falls into the encouraged category, foreign investment
can be conducted through the establishment of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise. If a restricted category, foreign investment may
be conducted through the establishment of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, provided certain requirements are met, and, in some
cases, the establishment of a joint venture enterprise is required with varying minimum shareholdings for the Chinese party depending
on the particular industry. If a prohibited category, foreign investment of any kind is not allowed. Any industry not falling into
any of the encouraged, restricted or prohibited categories is classified as a permitted industry for foreign investment. Our online
lending and risk management consulting businesses are classified as permitted foreign investment projects. However, if our online
lending platform is required to obtain an ICP certificate (see &quot;Risk Factors &mdash; Risks Related to the PRC Laws Regulating
Our Business and Industry &mdash; We may be required to obtain a value-added telecommunication business certificate and be subject
to foreign investment restrictions.&quot;), our online lending business will be classified as a restricted foreign investment project,
whereupon foreign investment will not be permitted to exceed 50% and the main foreign investor will be required to have a good
track record and operational experience in value-added telecommunications businesses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">In January&nbsp;2015, MOFCOM published the
Draft Foreign Investment Law soliciting the public's comments. Among other things, the Draft Foreign Investment Law expands the
definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of&thinsp;&quot;actual control&quot; in determining whether a company
is considered a foreign-invested enterprise. &quot;Control&quot; is broadly defined in the Draft Foreign Investment Law to cover
the following summarized categories: (i) holding 50% or more of the voting rights of the subject entity; (ii) holding less than
50% of the voting rights of the subject entity, but having the power to secure at least 50% of the seats on the board of directors
or other equivalent decision-making bodies, or having the voting power to exert material influence over the board of directors,
at the shareholders' meeting or over other equivalent decision-making bodies; or (iii) having the power to exert decisive influence,
via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity's operations, financial matters or other key aspects of business
operations. The Draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities established in China, but ultimately &quot;controlled&quot;
by foreign investors, will be treated as foreign-invested enterprises. If a foreign-invested enterprise proposes to conduct business
in an industry subject to foreign investment restrictions, the foreign-invested enterprise must go through a market entry clearance
by MOFCOM before being established. According to the Draft Foreign Investment Law, VIEs would also be deemed as foreign-invested
enterprises if they are ultimately &quot;controlled&quot; by foreign investors, and accordingly would be subject to restrictions
on foreign investments. However, the Draft Foreign Investment Law does not address what actions will be taken with respect to the
existing companies with a VIE structure. As of the date hereof, it is uncertain when the Draft Foreign Investment Law will become
a law, to what extent the final version will differ from the Draft Foreign Investment Law and the potential impact on companies
employing a VIE structure in the PRC. When the Draft Foreign Investment Law becomes effective, the trio of existing laws regulating
foreign investment in the PRC, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint
Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations,
will be abolished.</P>

Payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested
Enterprises (&quot;Circular 19&quot;), effective on June&nbsp;1, 2015, in replacement of SAFE Circular 142 (the Circular on the
Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital
of Foreign-Invested Enterprises. According to Circular 19, the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated
registered capital of a foreign-invested company is regulated such that RMB capital may not be used for the issuance of RMB entrusted
loans or the repayment of inter-enterprise loans or the repayment of banks loans that have been transferred to a third party. Although
Circular 19 allows RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise
to be used for equity investments within the PRC, it also reiterates the principle that RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated
capital of a foreign-invested company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope. Thus, it is
unclear whether SAFE will permit such capital to be used for equity investments in the PRC in actual practice. SAFE promulgated
the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement Management
Policy of Capital Account (the &quot;Circular 16&quot;), effective on June&nbsp;9, 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set
forth in Circular 19, but changes the prohibition against using RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered
capital of a foreign-invested company to issue RMB entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans to
non-associated enterprises. Violations of SAFE Circular 19 or Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">From 2012, SAFE has promulgated several circulars

special purpose foreign exchange accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC and remittance of foreign
exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification
of SAFE. In addition, domestic companies are no longer limited to extend cross-border loans to their offshore subsidiaries but
are also allowed to provide loans to their offshore parents and affiliates and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may
be opened in different provinces. SAFE also promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange
Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May&nbsp;2013, which specifies
that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted
by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on
the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches. In February&nbsp;2015, SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 13, which
took effect on June&nbsp;1, 2015. SAFE Circular 13 delegates the power to enforce the foreign exchange registration in connection
with inbound and outbound direct investments under relevant SAFE rules from local branches of SAFE to banks, thereby further simplifying
the foreign exchange registration procedures for inbound and outbound direct investments.</P>

remittance of profit from domestic entities to offshore entities, including (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks
shall check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records and audited financial statements;
and (ii) domestic entities shall hold income to account for previous years' losses before remitting the profits. Moreover, pursuant
to SAFE Circular 3, domestic entities shall make detailed explanations of the sources of capital and utilization arrangements,
and provide board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound
investment.</P>

Issues Relating to Domestic Resident's Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles (the
 &quot;SAFE Circular 37&quot;) in July&nbsp;2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch
in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.
In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes
material events relating to any change of basic information (including change of such PRC citizens or residents, name and operation
term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">SAFE Circular 37 was issued to replace SAFE
Circular 75 (the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents Engaging in Financing and
Roundtrip Investments via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles. SAFE further enacted the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving
the Foreign Exchange Management Policies for Direct Investment (the &quot;SAFE Circular 13&quot;) effective from June&nbsp;1, 2015,
, which allows PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks in connection with their establishment or control of
an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. However, remedial registration applications
made by PRC residents that previously failed to comply with the SAFE Circular 37 continue to fall under the jurisdiction of the
relevant local branch of SAFE. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill
the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from distributing profits
to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle
may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Moreover, failure to comply with the
various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange
controls.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">On February&nbsp;15, 2012, SAFE promulgated
the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive
Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies (the &quot;Stock Option Rules&quot;), which replaced the Application Procedures of
Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Ownership Plans or Stock Option Plans
of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies issued by SAFE on March&nbsp;28, 2007. Under the Stock Option Rules and other relevant rules
and regulations, PRC residents who participate in a stock incentive plan in an overseas publicly listed company are required to
register with SAFE or its local branches and complete certain other procedures. Participants of a stock incentive plan who are
PRC residents must retain a qualified PRC agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly listed company or another
qualified institution selected by such PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the
stock incentive plan on behalf of its participants. Such participants must also retain an overseas entrusted institution to handle
matters in connection with their exercise of stock options, the purchase and sale of corresponding shares or interests and fund
transfers. In addition, the PRC agent is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to our share incentive plans if there
are any material changes to the share incentive plans, the PRC agent or the overseas entrusted institution or other material changes.
In addition, SAFE Circular 37 provides that PRC residents who participate in a share incentive plan of an overseas unlisted special
purpose company may register with SAFE or its local branches before exercising rights. See &quot;Risk Factors&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Risks
Related to Doing Business in China&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Any failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration
requirements for employee stock incentive plans may subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative
sanctions.&quot;</P>

 &quot;EIT Law&quot;), which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2008, an enterprise established outside the PRC with &quot;de facto
management bodies&quot; within the PRC is considered a &quot;resident enterprise&quot; for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and
is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income. In 2009, the SAT issued the Notice Regarding
the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprise on the Basis of De Facto
Management Bodies (the &quot;SAT Circular 82&quot;), which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the &quot;de
facto management body&quot; of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Further to SAT Circular
82, in 2011, the SAT issued the Administrative Measures for Enterprise Income Tax of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident
Enterprises (Trial) (the &quot;SAT Bulletin 45&quot;) to provide more guidance on the implementation of SAT Circular 82.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">According to SAT Circular 82, an offshore
incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be considered a PRC resident enterprise by
virtue of having its &quot;de facto management body&quot; in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its worldwide
income only if all of the following conditions are met: (a) the senior management and core management departments in charge of
its daily operations function have their presence mainly in the PRC; (b) its financial and human resources decisions are subject
to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (c) its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes
and files of its board of directors and shareholders' meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (d) more than half of the enterprise's
directors or senior management with voting rights habitually reside in the PRC.</P>

45 only apply to offshore-incorporated enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups and not those controlled
by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determination criteria set forth therein may reflect the SAT's general position on how the
term &quot;de facto management body&quot; could be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless
of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises, individuals or foreigners.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The State Administration of Taxation has
promulgated several rules and notices to tighten the scrutiny over acquisition transactions in recent years, including the Notice
on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (the &quot;SAT Circular
698&quot;), the Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Income Tax of Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (the &quot;SAT Circular 24&quot;)
and the Notice on Certain Corporate Income Tax Matters on Indirect Transfer of Properties by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (the
 &quot;SAT Circular 7&quot;). Pursuant to these rules and notices, if a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests
in a PRC tax resident enterprise, such non-PRC resident transferor must report to the tax authorities at the place where the PRC
tax resident enterprise is located and is subject to a PRC withholding tax of up to 10%. In addition, if a non-PRC resident enterprise
indirectly transfers so-called PRC Taxable Properties, referring to properties of an establishment or a place of business in China,
real estate properties in China and equity investments in a PRC tax resident enterprise, by disposition of the equity interests
in an overseas non-public holding company without a reasonable commercial purpose and resulting in the avoidance of PRC enterprise
income tax, the transfer will be re-characterized as a direct transfer of the PRC Taxable Properties and gains derived from the
transfer may be subject to a PRC withholding tax of up to 10%. SAT Circular 7 has listed several factors to be taken into consideration
by the tax authorities in determining if an indirect transfer has a reasonable commercial purpose. However, regardless of these
factors, an indirect transfer satisfying all the following criteria will be deemed to lack a reasonable commercial purpose and
be taxable in the PRC: (i) 75% or more of the equity value of the intermediary enterprise being transferred is derived directly
or indirectly from PRC Taxable Properties; (ii) at any time during the one year period before the indirect transfer, 90% or more
of the asset value of the intermediary enterprise (excluding cash) is comprised directly or indirectly of investments in the PRC,
or 90% or more of its income is derived directly or indirectly from the PRC; (iii) the functions performed and risks assumed by
the intermediary enterprise and any of its subsidiaries that directly or indirectly hold the PRC Taxable Properties are limited
and are insufficient to prove their economic substance; and (iv) the foreign tax payable on the gain derived from the indirect
transfer of the PRC Taxable Properties is lower than the potential PRC tax on the direct transfer of those assets. On the other
hand, indirect transfers falling into the scope of the safe harbors under SAT Circular 7 may not be subject to PRC tax. The safe
harbors include qualified group restructurings, public market trades and exemptions under tax treaties.</P>

in the case of an indirect transfer, entities or individuals obligated to pay the transfer price to the transferor must act as
withholding agents and are required to withhold the PRC tax from the transfer price. If they fail to do so, the seller is required
to report and pay the PRC tax to the PRC tax authorities. If neither party complies with the tax payment or withholding obligations
under SAT Circular 7, the tax authority may impose penalties such as late payment interest on the seller. In addition, the tax
authority may also hold the withholding agents liable and impose a penalty of 50% to 300% of the unpaid tax on them. The penalty
imposed on the purchasers may be reduced or waived if the withholding agents have submitted the relevant materials in connection
with the indirect transfer to the PRC tax authorities in accordance with SAT Circular 7.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">On August&nbsp;8, 2006, six PRC regulatory
agencies, including China Securities Regulatory Commission (the &quot;CSRC&quot;), promulgated the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions
of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the &quot;M&amp;A Rules&quot;), which became effective on September&nbsp;8, 2006
and were amended on June&nbsp;22, 2009. The M&amp;A Rules, among other things, require offshore special purpose vehicles formed
for overseas listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC domestic enterprises or individuals
to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September&nbsp;21,
2006, the CSRC published a notice specifying the documents and materials that are required to be submitted for obtaining CSRC approval.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The M&amp;A Rules, and other recently adopted
regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger
and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. For example, the M&amp;A Rules require that MOFCOM
be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise,
if&thinsp;(i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact national economic
security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or
PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
on August&nbsp;30, 2007 and effective as of August&nbsp;1, 2008 requires that transactions which are deemed concentrations and
involve parties with specified turnover thresholds must be cleared by MOFCOM before they can be completed. In addition, on February&nbsp;3,
2011, the General Office of the State Council promulgated a Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions
of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the &quot;Circular 6&quot;), which officially established a security review system
for mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors. Further, on August&nbsp;25, 2011, MOFCOM promulgated
the Regulations on Implementation of Security Review System for the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors
(the &quot;MOFCOM Security Review Regulations&quot;), which became effective on September&nbsp;1, 2011, to implement Circular 6.
Under Circular 6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having &quot;national defense
and security&quot; concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire the &quot;de facto control&quot;
of domestic enterprises with &quot;national security&quot; concerns. Under the MOFCOM Security Review Regulations, MOFCOM will
focus on the substance and actual impact of the transaction when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition is subject to
security review. If MOFCOM decides that a specific merger or acquisition is subject to security review, it will submit it to the
Inter-Ministerial Panel, an authority established under Circular 6 led by the NDRC and MOFCOM under the leadership of the State
Council, to carry out the security review. The regulations prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review by structuring
transactions through trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions.
There is no explicit provision or official interpretation stating that the merger or acquisition of a company engaged in the marketplace
lending business requires security review.</P>

through our platform has grown since our acquisition of the platform. The total amount of loans facilitated or assigned through
our platform was approximately RMB 579 million (approximately US$89 million) from September&nbsp;2016 to March 31, 2018. To achieve
and maintain the growth of our platform, we must continuously increase the volume of loan transactions by retaining current participants
and attracting more users. We intend to continue to dedicate significant resources to our user acquisition efforts, including
establishing new acquisition channels, particularly as we continue to grow our platform and introduce new loan products. We utilize
online channels, such as search engine marketing, search engine optimization and partnerships with internet companies, as well
as our on-the-ground sales network for user acquisition. If there are insufficient qualified loan requests, investors may be unable
to deploy their capital in a timely or efficient manner and may seek other investment opportunities. If there are insufficient
investor commitments, borrowers may be unable to obtain capital through our platform and may turn to other sources for their financing
needs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The overall transaction volume through our platform may be affected by several factors, including, without limitation, our
brand recognition and reputation, the interest rates offered to users relative to market rates, the effectiveness of our risk
control, the repayment rate on our platform, the efficiency of our platform, the PRC macroeconomic environment and other factors.
In connection with the introduction of new products or in response to general economic conditions, we may also impose more stringent
borrower qualifications to ensure the quality of loans on our platform, which may negatively affect the growth of loan volume.
In addition, although we have entered into a Cooperation Framework Agreement with Resgreen Group, pursuant to which Resgreen Group
introduces our products and services to its members and business partners, we cannot assure you that we will receive sufficient
referrals from Resgreen Group. If any of our current user acquisition channels become less effective, if we are unable to continue
to use any of these channels or if we are not successful in using new channels, we may not be able to attract new investors in
a cost-effective manner or convert potential borrowers and investors into active borrowers and users, and may even lose our existing
users to our competitors. If we are unable to attract qualified borrowers and sufficient investor commitments or if our users
do not continue to participate in our platform at the current rates, we might be unable to increase our loan transaction volume
and revenues as we expect, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Investments in loans on our platform involve
inherent risks as the return of the principal on a loan investment made through our platform is not guaranteed, although we aim
to limit investor losses due to borrower defaults through various preventive measures we have taken or will take. Our ability to
attract borrowers and investors to, and build trust in, our platform is significantly dependent on our ability to effectively evaluate
a borrower's credit profile and maintain low default rates. If we are unable to effectively and accurately assess the credit profiles
of borrowers, we may either be unable to offer attractive fee rates to borrowers and returns to investors, or unable to maintain
low default rates of loans facilitated by our platform. In addition, once a loan application is approved, we do not further monitor
certain aspects of the borrower's credit profile, such as changes in the borrower's credit report and the borrower's actual use
of proceeds. If the borrower's financial condition deteriorates, we may not be able to take measures to prevent default on the
part of the borrower and thereby maintain low default rates for loans facilitated by our platform. As of the date of this Report,
there have not been any default or delinquencies. Since we started to offer unsecured loans, we may find it difficult or unable
to maintain low default rates of loans facilitated through our platform. Although we implement various investor protection measures,
if widespread defaults were to occur, investors may still incur losses and lose confidence in our platform and our business and
results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.</P>

relationships with our partners requires significant time and resources as does integrating third-party data and services. Our
current agreements with our partners also do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services.
Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to our partners to favor their products or services over ours, which could
have the effect of reducing the volume of loans facilitated through our platform if our partners were to direct potential borrowers
to other platforms or otherwise endorse our competitors' products over ours. Also, our partners may choose to offer a competing
lending platform and become a competitor themselves. In addition, these partners may not perform as expected under our agreements
with them, the benefits to us may not be as favorable as we expect and we may have disagreements or disputes with such partners,
any of which could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our business operations. If we cannot successfully enter

anti-money laundering regulations and management personnel requirements. Some third-party payment companies have been required
by the PBOC to suspend their credit card pre-authorization and payment services in certain areas of China. If the third-party
service providers that serve as payment channels for our platform were to suspend, limit or cease their operations, or if our
relationships with our third-party service providers were to otherwise terminate, we would need to implement substantially similar
arrangements with other third-party service providers. Negative publicity about our or other third-party service providers or

Healthy Growth of Internet Finance, or the Guidelines, which were released by ten PRC central government ministries and regulators,
including the PBOC, the CBRC, the Ministry of Finance, the MPS and the Cyberspace Administration of China, require market lending
platforms to use bank depository accounts to hold lending capital, which is further emphasized in the Interim Measures for the
Administration of Business Activities of Online Lending Information Intermediaries, or the Interim Measures. In addition, the Administrative
Measures of Non-Bank Payments Institutions Network Payment Service, or the Administrative Measures, which became effective from
July&nbsp;1, 2016, prohibit payment institutions from opening payment accounts for institutions engaging in the lending business
and also set ceilings for the maximum deposits permitted into an account opened with a third-party payment company. In February&nbsp;2017,
the CBRC released the Guidance to the Operation of Depositing Online Lending Funds, or the Guidance. The Guidance further specifies
that qualified commercial banks may act as depositories to hold online lending funds, and that other banking financial institutions
are not qualified to set up individual accounts or provide settlement and payment functions. The Guidance also sets forth basic
requirements for commercial banks, including maintaining separate accounts to hold online lending funds and private funds owned
by online lending platforms and prohibits outsourcing or assigning such entities' responsibilities for setting up capital accounts,
dealing with transaction information, verifying trading passwords and various other services to third parties, provided, however,
that certain cooperation regarding payment services with third-party payment companies is permitted in accordance with clarifications
by the CBRC. However, CBRC's remarks regarding the Guidance are not entirely clear regarding the definition and scope of the term
 &quot;certain cooperation regarding payment services.&quot; In addition, the Guidance imposes certain responsibilities on online
lending intermediaries such as us, including requiring them to organize independent auditing on funds depository accounts of borrowers
and investors. The Guidance stipulated a 6-month grace period from the time of its announcement for online lending intermediaries
to adjust their business models. See &quot;Business &mdash; Regulations&mdash;Regulations Related to the Marketplace Lending Industry.&quot;</P>

China is intensely competitive and evolving. We compete with a large number of online finance marketplaces. We also compete with
financial products and companies that attract borrowers, investors or both. With respect to borrowers, we primarily compete with
other lending platforms and traditional financial institutions, such as consumer finance business units in commercial banks, credit
card issuers and other consumer finance companies. With respect to investors, we primarily compete with other investment products
and asset classes, such as equities, bonds, investment trust products, bank savings accounts and real estate.</P>

have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources
to the development, promotion, sale and support of their platforms. Our competitors may also have longer operating histories, more
extensive user bases, greater brand recognition and brand loyalty and broader partner relationships than us. Additionally, a current
or potential competitor may acquire one or more of our existing competitors or form a strategic alliance with one or more of our
competitors. Our competitors may be better at developing new products, offering more attractive investment returns or lower fees,
responding faster to new technologies and undertaking more extensive and effective marketing campaigns. In response to competition
and in order to grow or maintain the volume of loan transactions through our platform, we may have to offer higher investment return
to investors or charge lower transaction fees, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.</P>

that our sophisticated custodian system and compatibility with current PRC regulations will make us more attractive to both borrowers
and investors. Based on information available on our competitors' websites as well as third party sources, we believe we were the
first non-state owned lending platform in Sichuan that has established a custodian system with a depository bank pursuant to the
requirements of applicable PRC regulations. We set up our custodian system with Guangdong Huaxing Bank in February of 2017 while
most of our competitors were either negotiating their agreements with custodian banks or were (or currently remain) in the process
of transitioning to the custodian system operated by their depository banks. In addition, loan transactions on our platform comply
with restrictions on aggregate loan amounts for individual borrowers and businesses set forth in PRC regulations while our competitors
are in the process of restructuring loans on their platforms to comply with such requirement.</P>

Successful promotion of our brand and our ability to attract users depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts

and it is likely that our future marketing efforts will require us to incur additional expenses. These efforts may not result in
increased revenues in the immediate future or at all and, even if they do, any increases in revenues may not offset the expenses
incurred. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand while incurring substantial expenses, our results of operations

either case if we are also found to be at fault, due to failure or deemed failure to exercise proper care, such as to conduct adequate

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">In addition, certain factors that may adversely
affect our reputation are beyond our control. Negative publicity about our partners, outsourced service providers or other counterparties,
such as negative publicity about their debt collection practices and any failure by them to adequately protect the information
of users, to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to otherwise meet required quality and service standards could harm
our reputation. Furthermore, any negative development in the online marketplace lending industry, such as bankruptcies or failures
of other finance marketplaces, and especially a large number of such bankruptcies or failures, or negative perception of the industry
as a whole, such as that arises from any failure of other finance marketplaces to detect or prevent money laundering or other illegal
activities, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents, could compromise our image, undermine the trust and credibility
we have established and impose a negative impact on our ability to attract new borrowers and investors. Negative developments in
the online marketplace lending industry, such as widespread borrower defaults, fraudulent behavior and/or the closure of other
online finance marketplaces, may also lead to tightened regulatory scrutiny of the sector and limit the scope of permissible business
activities that may be conducted by online finance marketplaces like us. If any of the foregoing takes place, our business and
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.</P>

we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. There are
other factors that could negatively affect our financial conditions. For example, the default rates of the loans facilitated through
our platform may be higher than expected, which may lead to lower than expected net revenues. As a result of the foregoing and
other factors, our net revenue growth may slow, our net income margins may decline or we may incur additional net losses in the

that, with the proceeds from our initial public offering and anticipated cash flows from operating activities, we will be able
to meet our anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business for the next

operations. However, we cannot assure you this will be the case. We may need additional cash resources in the future if we experience
changes in business conditions or other developments. We may also need additional cash resources in the future if we find and
wish to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, capital expenditure or similar actions. If we determine that our cash
requirements exceed the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have on hand at the time, we may seek to issue equity or debt securities
or obtain credit facilities. The issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our stockholders.
The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would
restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at

or incomplete, those investors may not receive their expected returns and our reputation may be harmed. Moreover, inaccurate, misleading
or incomplete borrower information could also potentially subject us to liability as an intermediary under the PRC Contract Law.

our employees and third-party service providers to interact with potential users, process large numbers of transactions and support
the loan collection process, all of which involve the use and disclosure of personal information. We could be materially adversely
affected if transactions were redirected, misappropriated or otherwise improperly executed, if personal information was disclosed
to unintended recipients or if an operational breakdown or failure in the processing of transactions occurred, whether as a result
of human error, purposeful sabotage or fraudulent manipulation of our operations or systems. In addition, the manner in which we

not always possible to identify and deter misconduct or errors by employees or third-party service providers, and the precautions
we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses. If any of
our employees or third-party service providers take, convert or misuse funds, documents or data or fail to follow protocol when
interacting with users, we could be liable for damages and subject to regulatory actions and penalties. We could also be perceived
to have facilitated or participated in the illegal misappropriation of funds, documents or data, or the failure to follow protocol,
and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability. Aggressive practices or misconduct by any of our third-party service providers
in the course of collecting loans could damage our reputation.</P>

global economy may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, general
economic factors and conditions in China or worldwide, including the general interest rate environment and unemployment rates,
may affect borrower willingness to seek loans and investor ability and desire to invest in loans. Economic conditions in China
are sensitive to global economic conditions. The global financial markets have experienced significant disruptions since 2008 and
the United States, Europe and other economies have experienced periods of recession. The recovery from the lows of 2008 and 2009
has been uneven and there are new challenges, including the escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis from 2011 and the
slowdown of China's economic growth since 2012 which may continue. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects
of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world's
leading economies, including the United States and China. There have also been concerns over unrest in Ukraine, the Middle East
and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in financial and other markets. There have also been concerns about the economic
effect of the tensions in the relationship between China and surrounding Asian countries. If present Chinese and global economic
uncertainties persist, many of our investors may delay or reduce their investment in the loans facilitated through our platform.
Adverse economic conditions could also reduce the number of qualified borrowers seeking loans on our platform, as well as their
ability to make payments. Should any of these situations occur, the amount of loans facilitated through our platform and our net
revenues will decline, and our business and financial conditions will be negatively impacted. Additionally, continued turbulence
in the international markets may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs.</P>

access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable

unauthorized access to our platform could cause confidential user information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes. Security

control over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.
Moreover, even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered
public accounting firm, after conducting its own independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied
with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets
the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, after we become a public company, our reporting obligations may place
a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. We may be unable
to timely complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">During the course of documenting and testing
our internal control procedures, in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404, we may identify other weaknesses and deficiencies
in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over
financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to conclude
on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we fail
to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements
and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information.
This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations, and lead to a decline in the trading price
of our securities. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud
or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations
and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods.</P>

is maintained through state-owned telecommunication operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the

through local telecommunications lines and internet data centers to host our servers. We have limited access to alternative networks
or services in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with China's internet infrastructure or the fixed telecommunications
networks provided by telecommunication service providers. With the expansion of our business, we may be required to upgrade our
technology and infrastructure to keep up with the increasing traffic on our platform. We cannot assure you that the internet infrastructure

internet usage.</P>

our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. Our disaster recovery plan has not been
tested under actual disaster conditions, and we may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services in the event
of an outage. These factors could prevent us from processing or posting payments on loans, damage our brand and reputation, divert

proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on a combination of intellectual
property laws and contractual arrangements, including confidentiality and non-compete agreements with our employees and others
to protect our proprietary rights. We have made twelve trade applications, both of which are pending with the Trademark Office
under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. See &quot;Business &mdash; Intellectual Property&quot; and &quot;Business
 &mdash; Regulations &mdash; Regulations on Intellectual Property Rights.&quot; Thus, we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual
property rights would not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated, or such intellectual property will be sufficient
to provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, parts
of our business rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">It is often difficult to register, maintain
and enforce intellectual property rights in China. Statutory laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and enforcement
and may not be applied consistently due to the lack of clear guidance on statutory interpretation. Confidentiality and non-compete
agreements may be breached by counterparties, and there may not be adequate remedies available to us for any such breach. Accordingly,
we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or to enforce our contractual rights in China. Preventing
any unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly and the steps we take may be inadequate to prevent the
misappropriation of our intellectual property. In the event that we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights,
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managerial and financial resources. We can provide no
assurance that we will prevail in such litigation. In addition, our trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to,
or be independently discovered by, our competitors. To the extent that our employees or consultants use intellectual property owned
by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related know-how and inventions. Any failure in protecting

and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, there may be third-party trademarks, patents, copyrights,
know-how or other intellectual property rights that are infringed by our products, services or other aspects of our business without
our awareness. Holders of such intellectual property rights may seek to enforce such intellectual property rights against us in
China, the United States or other jurisdictions. If any third-party infringement claims are brought against us, we may be forced

regulatory authorities would agree with our analysis. If we were found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others,
we may be subject to liability for our infringement activities or may be prohibited from using such intellectual property, and

we are required by PRC laws and regulations to pay various statutory employee benefits, including pension, housing fund, medical
insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance to designated government agencies for
the benefit of our employees. The relevant government agencies may examine whether an employer has made adequate payments to the
statutory employee benefits, and those employers who fail to make adequate payments may be subject to late payment fees, fines
and/or other penalties. We expect that our labor costs, including wages and employee benefits, will continue to increase. Unless
we are able to control our labor costs or pass on these increased labor costs to our users by increasing the fees of our services,
our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.</P>

is considered a foreign invested enterprise. To comply with PRC laws and regulations, we conduct our operations in China through
a series of contractual arrangements entered into among Senmiao Consulting, Sichuan Senmiao and the equity holders of Sichuan Senmiao.
As a result of these contractual arrangements, we exert control over Sichuan Senmiao and consolidate its operating results in our
financial statements under U.S. GAAP. For a detailed description of these contractual arrangements, see &quot;Business &mdash;
Our Corporate History and Structure.&quot;</P>

Tai Law Offices, our current ownership structure, the ownership structure of our PRC subsidiary and our consolidated variable
interest entity, and the contractual arrangements among Senmiao Consulting, Sichuan Senmiao and the equity holders of Sichuan
Senmiao are not in violation of existing PRC laws, rules and regulations; and these contractual arrangements are valid, binding
and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect. However, Yuan Tai
Law Offices has also advised us that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current
or future PRC laws and regulations and there can be no assurance that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent
with the opinion of our PRC counsel.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws,
rules or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide. In
particular, in January&nbsp;2015, the Ministry of Commerce (&quot;MOC&quot;), published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign
Investment Law for public review and comments. Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the definition of
foreign investment and introduces the principle of&thinsp;&quot;actual control&quot; in determining whether a company is considered
a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. Under the draft Foreign Investment Law, variable interest entities would also be deemed
as FIEs, if they are ultimately &quot;controlled&quot; by foreign investors, and be subject to restrictions on foreign investments.
However, the draft law has not taken a position on what actions will be taken with respect to the existing companies with the
 &quot;variable interest entity&quot; structure, whether or not these companies are controlled by Chinese parties. It is uncertain
when the draft would be signed into law and whether the final version would have any substantial changes from the draft. See &quot;Business
 &mdash; Regulations &mdash; Regulations Related to Company Establishment and Foreign Investment&quot; and &quot;Risk Factors &mdash;
Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of draft PRC Foreign
Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations.&quot;
If the ownership structure, contractual arrangements and business of our company, our PRC subsidiary or our consolidated variable
interest entity are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or we fail to obtain or maintain
any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant governmental authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such
violation, including levying fines, confiscating our income or the income of our PRC subsidiary or consolidated variable interest
entity, revoking the business licenses or operating licenses of our PRC subsidiary or consolidated variable interest entity, shutting
down our servers or blocking our online platform, discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations,
requiring us to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring, restricting or prohibiting our use of proceeds from our initial
public offering to finance our business and operations in China, and taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could
be harmful to our business. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to our business operations and severely damage
our reputation, which would in turn materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If any of these occurrences results in our inability to direct the activities of our consolidated variable interest entity, and/or
our failure to receive economic benefits from our consolidated variable interest entity, we may not be able to consolidate its
results into our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, since we conduct the bulk of our
operations through our VIE entity, invalidity of the VIE arrangements could cause the market price of our common stock to substantially
decline.</P>

we would be able to exercise our rights as an equity holder to effect changes in the board of directors of Sichuan Senmiao, which
in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management and operational level. However,
under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by our consolidated variable interest entity and its equity
holders of their obligations under the contracts to exercise control over our consolidated variable interest entity. The equity
holders of our consolidated variable interest entity may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their
obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate our business through the
contractual arrangements with our consolidated variable interest entity. Although we have the right to replace any equity holder
of our consolidated variable interest entity under the contractual arrangement, if any equity holder of our consolidated variable
interest entity is uncooperative or any dispute relating to these contracts remains unresolved, we will have to enforce our rights
under these contracts through the operations of PRC laws and arbitration, litigation and other legal proceedings and therefore
will be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system. See &quot;Risk Factors &mdash; Any failure by our consolidated variable
interest entity or its equity holders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them would have a material

costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. We may also have to rely on legal remedies under PRC laws,
including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective
under PRC laws. For example, if the equity holders of Sichuan Senmiao were to refuse to transfer their equity interest in Sichuan
Senmiao to us or our designee if we exercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if they were otherwise
to act in bad faith toward us, then we may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">All the agreements under our contractual
arrangements are governed by PRC laws and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in China. Accordingly, these
contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures.
The legal system in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties
in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. Meanwhile, there are very few precedents
and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a consolidated variable interest entity should
be interpreted or enforced under PRC laws. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of such arbitration
should legal action become necessary. In addition, under PRC laws, rulings by arbitrators are final and parties cannot appeal arbitration
results in court unless such rulings are revoked or determined unenforceable by a competent court. If the losing parties fail to
carry out the arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards
in PRC courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which would require additional expenses and delay. In the event
that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant delay or other obstacles in the process
of enforcing these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over our consolidated variable interest
entity, and our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected. See &quot;Risk Factors &mdash; Risks Related to Doing
Business in China &mdash; Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations could limit the legal
protections available to us.&quot;</P>

contractual arrangements we have with them and our consolidated variable interest entity, which would have a material adverse effect
on our ability to effectively control our consolidated variable interest entity and receive economic benefits from it. For example,
the equity holders may be able to cause our agreements with Sichuan Senmiao to be performed in a manner adverse to us by, among
other things, failing to remit payments due under the contractual arrangements to us on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that

into on an arm's length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible reduction in taxes under applicable PRC laws, rules
and regulations, and adjust Sichuan Senmiao's income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment
could, among other things, result in a reduction of expense deductions recorded by Sichuan Senmiao for PRC tax purposes, which
could in turn increase its tax liabilities without reducing Senmiao Consulting's tax expenses. In addition, if Senmiao Consulting
requests the equity holders of Sichuan Senmiao to transfer their equity interests in Sichuan Senmiao at nominal or no value pursuant
to these contractual arrangements, such transfer could be viewed as a gift and subject Senmiao Consulting to PRC income tax. Furthermore,
the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties on Sichuan Senmiao for the adjusted but unpaid taxes according
to the applicable regulations. Our financial position could be materially and adversely affected if our consolidated variable interest
entity's tax liabilities increase or if it is required to pay late payment fees and other penalties.</P>

According to the Guidelines, online marketplace lending platforms may only serve as intermediaries to provide information services
to borrowers and investors, and may not provide credit enhancement services or illegally conduct fundraising. The Guidelines also
outlined certain regulatory propositions, which would require Internet finance companies, including online marketplace lending
platforms, to (i) complete website filing procedures with the administrative departments overseeing telecommunications; (ii) use
banking financial institutions' depository accounts to hold lending capital, and engage an independent auditor to audit such accounts
and publish audit results to customers; (iii) improve the disclosure of operational and financial information, provide sufficient
risk disclosure, and set up thresholds for qualified investors to provide better protections to investors; (iv) enhance online
security management to protect customers' personal and transactional information; and (v) take measures against anti-money laundering
and other financial crimes.</P>

be operating in full compliance with the Guidelines, the Interim Measures, the Guidance and the other principles that have been

about the definition of&thinsp; &quot;credit enhancement service,&quot; nor do they address whether a marketplace lending platform's
affiliated enterprises could provide a &quot;credit enhancement service.&quot; Additionally, the Interim Measures provide upper
limits on the loan balance of a single borrower. While our business mainly involves lending small amounts to a large number of
borrowers, we still may not be in full compliance with the upper limits set forth in the Interim Measures. We have adjusted the
upper limits of our loans as necessary. We may need to rely on the information provided by borrowers to determine whether their
lending amounts from all intermediaries have reached the upper limits, and the information they provide us may contain misrepresentation
or omission or otherwise be unreliable. Moreover, the Interim Measures require online lending intermediaries to file with the local
financial regulators and to include serving as an Internet lending information intermediary in their business scope. We plan to
make all requisite filings and changes to our business scope to the extent necessary when such filing procedures are clarified
by the relevant authorities. Although we do not anticipate any material difficulties in making the requisite filings or changing
our business scope, any failure to do so within the specified twelve-month transition period may result in the violation of the
Interim Measures. In addition, the Interim Measures stipulate that online lending intermediaries shall not operate businesses other
than risk management and necessary business processes such as information collection and confirmation, post-loan tracking and pledge
management in accordance with online-lending regulations, via offline physical locations. However, the Interim Measures do not
clearly set forth the types of business process that are not permitted to operate through offline physical locations.</P>

anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing, systems, facilities and technologies, service fees, electronic signatures, loan

business is deemed to be non-compliant with any of these requirements of the Interim Measures, we may need to make necessary adjustments
to comply within the specified twelve-month transition period and, as a result, our business may be materially and adversely affected.
If we fail to rectify the non-compliance within the specified twelve-month transition period or the period set forth by relevant
regulatory authorities, the relevant governmental authorities would have broad authorities in dealing with our failure of compliance,
the business license or operating licenses of our PRC subsidiary or affiliated entity may be revoked, our online platform may be

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The marketplace lending industry in China
has historically been largely unregulated. In July&nbsp;2015, ten PRC central government ministries and regulators, including the
PBOC, the CBRC, the Ministry of Finance, the MPS and the Cyberspace Administration of China, together released the Guidelines,
which provide regulatory principles for Internet financing businesses, including those in the online marketplace lending industry.
In August&nbsp;2016, the CBRC and other regulators collectively announced the Interim Measures, which proposed the implementation
of new requirements including, among others, filing, reporting, fund depository, risk and information disclosure, loan management
and the permitted business scope for participants in the online marketplace lending industry. In November&nbsp;2016, the CBRC,
the MIIT and the Industry and Commerce Administration Department, jointly issued the Guidance to the Administration of Filling
and Registration of Online Lending Information Intermediaries, or the Guidance of Administration, which provides general filing
rules for online lending intermediaries, and authorizes local financial regulators to make detailed implementation rules regarding
filing procedures according to their local practices. See &quot;Business &mdash; Regulations &mdash; Regulations Related to the
Marketplace Lending Industry.&quot; Since 2017, local financial regulators have been conducting thorough investigations and inspections
of online lending intermediaries and require a rectification if any illegality is discovered. After local financing regulators
have completed their investigation and examination, we may be permitted to submit a filing application. In February&nbsp;2017,
the CBRC released the Guidance to regulate funds depositories for online lending intermediaries, which defines several obligations
and responsibilities of online lending intermediaries and commercial banks involved in the online funds depository business. See
 &quot;Business &mdash; Regulations &mdash; Regulations Related to the Marketplace Lending Industry.&quot; Nevertheless, it is uncertain
as to how the Interim Measures will be further interpreted and implemented. The relevant local authorities are also in the process
of making detailed implementation rules regarding filing procedures. However, the final content and timing of the final implementation
rules and other related new rules are uncertain. To the extent that we are not able to fully comply with the new regulations in
the grace period of twelve months or any new regulations differ from our expectations, we may be materially and adversely affected.
The relevant governmental authorities would have broad authorities in dealing with our failure of compliance, including levying
fines, confiscating our income or the income of our PRC subsidiary or affiliated entity, revoking the business license or operating
licenses of our PRC subsidiary or affiliated entity, shutting down our servers or blocking our online platform, discontinuing or
placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operation, requiring us to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring, and
taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business. Any of these actions could cause significant
disruption to our business operations and severely damage our reputation, which would in turn materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. We are unable to predict with certainty the impact, if any, that future
legislation, judicial precedents, or regulations relating to the marketplace lending industry will have on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the increasing growth in popularity of marketplace lending and borrowing increases
the likelihood that the PRC government will seek to further regulate the marketplace lending industry.</P>

Internet commerce, including online marketplaces such as our platform, with respect to our platform's online and mobile-based channels,

regulation, could affect the operation of our platform and the way in which we interact with borrowers and investors. The cost
to comply with such laws or regulations would increase our operating expenses, and we may be unable to pass those costs on to borrowers
and investors in the form of increased fees. In addition, governmental or regulatory agencies may decide to impose taxes on services
provided over the Internet or by online marketplaces. These taxes could discourage the use of our platform, which would adversely
affect the viability of our business.</P>

interpretations of the fundraising-related laws and regulations. While our agreements with investors require investors to guarantee
the legality of all funds investors put on our platform, we do not verify the source of investors' funds separately, and therefore,
to the extent that investors' funds are obtained through illegal fundraising, we may be negligently liable as a facilitator of
illegal fundraising. In addition, we do not monitor the borrowers' use of funds on an on-going basis, and therefore, to the extent
that borrowers use proceeds from the loans for illegal activities, we may be negligently liable as a facilitator of an illegal

in Internet information services of a commercial nature without having obtained an Internet content provider, or ICP, certificate.
PRC regulations also impose sanctions for engaging in the operation of online data processing and transaction processing without
having obtained an online data processing and transaction processing, or ODPTP, certificate (ICP and ODPTP are both sub-sets of
value-added telecommunication business certificates). These sanctions include corrective orders and warnings from the PRC communication
administration authority, fines and confiscation of illegal gains and, in the case of significant infringements, the websites may
be ordered to cease operation. Nevertheless, the PRC regulatory authorities' enforcement of such regulations in the context of
marketplace lending platforms remains unclear. The Interim Measures provide that online lending information intermediaries must
apply for value-added telecommunications business licenses in accordance with the relevant provisions of telecommunications authorities
after filing with a local financial regulator. However, PRC regulatory authorities to date have not explicitly stipulated whether
the operator of a marketplace lending platform (including in the form of a website or mobile Internet application) is engaging
in Internet information services requiring an ICP certificate or an ODPTP certificate. If we could not obtain such value-added
telecommunication certificates pursuant to the relevant regulations, we may not be able to conduct online lending intermediaries'
services, but it is unclear whether online lending intermediaries would be deemed to be engaged in a commercial information provider
business or online data processing and transaction processing business or whether an ICP certificate or an ODPTP certificate is
required. To the extent that the PRC regulatory authorities require such value-added telecommunication certificate to be obtained
or set forth rules that impose additional requirements, and we do not obtain such certificate, we may be subject to the sanctions
described above. We plan to apply for filing immediately after the filing procedures are clarified by the relevant authorities,
and apply for the corresponding value-added telecommunication business certificates after completing the filing, provided that
the relevant telecommunication authority clarify which sub-set of telecommunication business certificates need to be obtained by
market lending platforms and how to apply for such certificate.</P>

of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate,
control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the
utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of
improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the
government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing
industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China's economic growth through allocating
resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential
treatment to particular industries or companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">While the Chinese economy has experienced
significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy.
The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some
of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition
and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations.
In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control
the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, and since 2012, China's economic growth
has slowed down. Any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy may reduce the demand for our products and services and materially
and adversely affect our business and results of operations.</P>

Moreover, developments in the peer-to-peer lending service industry may lead to changes in PRC laws, regulations and policies or

Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published in

foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture
Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations.
The draft Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime
in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign
and domestic investments. The MOC is currently soliciting comments on this draft and substantial uncertainties exist with respect
to its enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation. The draft Foreign Investment Law, if enacted as proposed, may materially

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment
Law expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &quot;actual control&quot; in determining whether
a company is considered an FIE. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities established in China but &quot;controlled&quot;
by foreign investors will be treated as FIEs. Once an entity is considered to be an FIE, it may be subject to the foreign investment
restrictions or prohibitions set forth in a &quot;negative list&quot; to be separately issued by the State Council later. If an
FIE proposes to conduct business in an industry subject to foreign investment &quot;restrictions&quot; in the &quot;negative list,&quot;
the FIE must go through a market entry clearance by the MOC before being established. If an FIE proposes to conduct business in
an industry subject to foreign investment &quot;prohibitions&quot; in the &quot;negative list,&quot; it must not engage in the
business. However, an FIE that is subject to foreign investment &quot;restrictions,&quot; upon market entry clearance, may apply
in writing for being treated as a PRC domestic investment if it is ultimately &quot;controlled&quot; by PRC government authorities
and its affiliates and/or PRC citizens. In this connection, &quot;control&quot; is broadly defined in the draft law to cover the
following summarized categories: (i) holding 50% or more of the voting rights of the subject entity; (ii) holding less than 50%
of the voting rights of the subject entity but having the power to secure at least 50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent
decision making bodies, or having the voting power to exert material influence on the board, the equity holders' meeting or other
equivalent decision making bodies; or (iii) having the power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements,
over the subject entity's operations, financial matters or other key aspects of business operations. Once an entity is determined
to be an FIE, it will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in a &quot;negative list,&quot;
to be separately issued by the State Council at a later date, if the FIE is engaged in an industry listed in the negative list.
Unless the underlying business of the FIE falls within the negative list, which calls for market entry clearance by the MOC, prior
approval from the government authorities as mandated by the existing foreign investment legal regime would no longer be required
for establishment of the FIE.</P>

consumer finance marketplace industry, in which our variable interest entity operates, will be subject to the foreign investment
restrictions or prohibitions set forth in the &quot;negative list&quot; that is to be issued. If the enacted version of the Foreign
Investment Law and the final &quot;negative list&quot; mandate further actions, such as MOC market entry clearance or certain restructuring
of our corporate structure and operations, to be completed by companies with existing VIE structure like us, there may be substantial
uncertainties as to whether we can complete these actions in a timely manner, or at all, and our business and financial condition

draft Foreign Investment Law imposes stringent ad hoc and periodic information reporting requirements on foreign investors and
the applicable FIEs. Aside from an investment implementation report and an investment amendment report that are required for each
investment and alteration of investment specifics, an annual report is mandatory, and large foreign investors meeting certain criteria
are required to report on a quarterly basis. Any company found to be non-compliant with these information reporting obligations
may potentially be subject to fines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities, and the persons directly responsible may be

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The evolving PRC regulatory system for the
internet industry may lead to the establishment of new regulatory agencies. For example, in May&nbsp;2011, the State Council announced
the establishment of a new department, the State Internet Information Office (with the involvement of the State Council Information
Office, the MIIT, and the MPS). The primary role of this new agency is to facilitate the policy-making and legislative development
in this field, to direct and coordinate with the relevant departments in connection with online content administration and to deal
with cross-ministry regulatory matters in relation to the internet industry.</P>

require Sichuan Senmiao to obtain an ICP License. An ICP License is a value-added telecommunications business operating license
required for provision of commercial internet information services. See &quot;Regulation &mdash; Regulations Related to Value-Added
Telecommunication Business Certificates and Foreign Investment Restrictions.&quot; Sichuan Senmiao, our PRC consolidated variable

to mobile device users, it is uncertain if Sichuan Senmiao will be required to obtain a separate operating license in addition
to the ICP License. Although we believe that not obtaining such separate license is in line with the current market practice, there
can be no assurance that we will not be required to apply for an operating license for our mobile applications in the future.</P>

operation of a telecommunications business in China. According to this circular, either the holder of a value-added telecommunication
services operation permit or its shareholders must directly own the domain names and trademarks used by such license holders in
their provision of value-added telecommunication services. The circular also requires each license holder to have the necessary
facilities, including servers, for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its
license. Sichuan Senmiao owns the relevant domain names in connection with our value-added telecommunications business and has
the necessary personnel to operate our website. However, if operating telecommunications business without operating licenses, the
relevant governmental authority will order to rectify, confiscate illegal gains and impose a fine equal to three to five times
of the illegal gains. If no illegal gains or the illegal gain is less than RMB 50,000, a fine amounting to RMB 100,000 to RMB 1,000,000
will be imposed. In case of gross violation, the business shall be suspended and rectification will be carried out.</P>

In addition, SAFE issued a circular in September&nbsp;2008, SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested

provides that the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be
used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and unless otherwise provided by law,
may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. On July&nbsp;4, 2014, the SAFE issued the Circular of the SAFE on Relevant
Issues Concerning the Pilot Reform in Certain Areas of the Administrative Method of the Conversion of Foreign Exchange Funds by
Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 36, which launched a pilot reform of the administration of the settlement of the
foreign exchange capitals of foreign-invested enterprises in certain designated areas from August&nbsp;4, 2014 and some of the
restrictions under SAFE Circular 142 will not apply to the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of the foreign-invested
enterprises established within the designate areas and such enterprises are allowed to use its RMB capital converted from foreign
exchange capitals to make equity investment. On March&nbsp;30, 2015, SAFE promulgated Circular 19, to expand the reform nationwide.
Circular 19 came into force and replaced both Circular 142 and Circular 36 on June&nbsp;1, 2015. Circular 19 allows foreign-invested
enterprises to make equity investments by using RMB fund converted from foreign exchange capital. However, Circular 19 continues
to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using RMB fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals
for expenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises. In addition,
SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a
foreign-invested company. The use of such RMB capital may not be altered without SAFE's approval, and such RMB capital may not
in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of these Circulars could result
in severe monetary or other penalties. These circulars may significantly limit our ability to use RMB converted from the net proceeds
of our initial public offering to fund the establishment of new entities in China by our PRC subsidiary, to invest in or acquire
any other PRC companies through our PRC subsidiary, or to establish new variable interest entities in the PRC.</P>

other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar
and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions and China's foreign
exchange policies. On July&nbsp;21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to
the U.S. dollar, and the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. However, the People's
Bank of China, or the PBOC, regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit fluctuations in RMB exchange rates and
achieve policy goals. During the period between July&nbsp;2008 and June&nbsp;2010, the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S.
dollar had been stable and traded within a narrow range. However, the RMB fluctuated significantly during that period against
other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar. Since June&nbsp;2010, the RMB has started to slowly appreciate
against the U.S. dollar, though there have been periods when the U.S. dollar has appreciated against the RMB. On August&nbsp;11,
2015, the PBOC allowed the RMB to depreciate by approximately 2% against the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict how long
such depreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar may last and when and how the relationship between the RMB and the U.S. dollar
may change again.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a flexible currency policy. Any
significant appreciation or depreciation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our revenues, earnings and financial position,
and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our securities in U.S. dollars. For example, to the extent that we need to convert
U.S. dollars we receive from our initial public offering into RMB to pay our operating expenses, appreciation of the RMB against
the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, a significant
depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings, which in
turn could adversely affect the price of our securities.</P>

future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure
or at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability
to convert RMB into foreign currency. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on your investment.</P>

all of our net revenues in RMB. Under our current corporate structure, we rely on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiary to
fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account
items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies
without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. Therefore, our PRC subsidiary is able to pay
dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior approval from SAFE, subject to the condition that the remittance of such dividends
outside of the PRC complies with certain procedures under PRC foreign exchange regulation, such as the overseas investment registrations
by the beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents. But approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities
is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment
of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign
currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign
currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our stockholders.</P>

plan of an overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic
qualified agent, which could be the PRC subsidiary of such overseas listed company, and complete certain other procedures. In addition,
an overseas entrusted institution must be retained to handle matters in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options and
the purchase or sale of shares and interests. In the event we adopt an equity incentive plan, we and our executive officers and
other employees who are PRC citizens or who have resided in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year and who are

overseas listed company. Failure to complete the SAFE registrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may also

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and
its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a &quot;de facto management body&quot; within the PRC
is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25%. The
implementation rules define the term &quot;de facto management body&quot; as the body that exercises full and substantial control
over and overall management of the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April&nbsp;2009,
the State Administration of Taxation issued a circular, known as Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining
whether the &quot;de facto management body&quot; of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China.
Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled
by PRC individuals or foreigners like us, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation's
general position on how the &quot;de facto management body&quot; test should be applied in determining the tax resident status
of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a
PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its &quot;de facto management body&quot; in China
and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the
primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise's financial
and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise's
primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in
the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.</P>

China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. See &quot;Regulations &mdash; Regulations Related to Tax.&quot; However,
the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect
to the interpretation of the term &quot;de facto management body.&quot; As substantially all of our management members are based
in China, it remains unclear how the tax residency rule will apply to our case. If the PRC tax authorities determine that the Company
or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then the Company
or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its world-wide income, which could materially reduce our net
income. In addition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities
determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition
of our securities may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC
individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources.
It is unclear whether non-PRC stockholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their
country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the
returns on your investment in our securities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The PRC tax authorities have enhanced their
scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of certain taxable assets, including, in particular, equity interests in a PRC resident
enterprise, by a non-resident enterprise by promulgating and implementing SAT Circular 59 and Circular 698, which became effective

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Under Circular 698, where a non-resident
enterprise conducts an &quot;indirect transfer&quot; by transferring the equity interests of a PRC &quot;resident enterprise&quot;
indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor,
may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without
reasonable commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up
to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise
to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable
adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">In February&nbsp;2015, the SAT issued Circular
7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly
different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under
Circular&nbsp;698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign
intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial
purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public
securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated
to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an &quot;indirect transfer&quot; by transferring
the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise
being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax
authority such indirect transfer. Using a &quot;substance over form&quot; principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence
of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding
or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the
transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at
a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">We face uncertainties on the reporting and
consequences on future private equity financing transactions, share exchange or other transactions involving the transfer of shares
in our company by investors that are non-PRC resident enterprises. The PRC tax authorities may pursue such non-resident enterprises
with respect to a filing or the transferees with respect to withholding obligation, and request our PRC subsidiaries to assist
in the filing. As a result, we and non-resident enterprises in such transactions may become at risk of being subject to filing
obligations or being taxed, under Circular 59 or Circular 698 and Circular 7, and may be required to expend valuable resources
to comply with Circular 59, Circular 698 and Circular 7 or to establish that we and our non-resident enterprises should not be
taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The PRC tax authorities have the discretion
under SAT Circular 59, Circular 698 and Circular 7 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains based on the difference between
the fair value of the taxable assets transferred and the cost of investment. Although we currently have no plans to pursue any
acquisitions in China or elsewhere in the world, we may pursue acquisitions in the future that may involve complex corporate structures.
If we are considered a non-resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and if the PRC tax authorities make adjustments
to the taxable income of the transactions under SAT Circular 59 or Circular 698 and Circular 7, our income tax costs associated
with such potential acquisitions will be increased, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.</P>

particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses

Nasdaq have imposed <FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">various</FONT> requirements on public companies, including
establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management
and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and
regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.
For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director
and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our
board of directors.</P>

an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting
issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section&nbsp;404 within the prescribed
period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly
and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants
and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps
to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement
a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk
that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe
that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section&nbsp;404. This could result in an adverse
reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.</P>

by wholly foreign owned enterprises. Under these regulations, wholly foreign owned enterprises may pay dividends only out of their
accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, such companies
are required to set aside a certain amount of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds until
such time as the accumulated reserve funds reach and remain above 50% of the registered capital amount. These reserves are not
distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation and cannot be used for working capital purposes. Furthermore,
if our subsidiaries and affiliates in China incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict
its ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our subsidiary and affiliates are unable to receive all of the revenues
from our operations through the current contractual arrangements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">We operate an online lending platform in
China connecting Chinese investors with individual and SME borrowers. Through our platform, we offer quick and easy access to credit
to borrowers and attractive investment returns for investors. As more fully described in the Business section, we acquired the
Aihongsen platform from Chenghexin in September 2016. Since the Acquisition through March 31, 2018, we have facilitated direct
loans and assignment of loans with an aggregate of principal of over RMB579 million (approximately US$89 million). As of March
31, 2018, we had an aggregate of 40,044 registered users and a total of 3,372 investors, 2,558 borrowers and two creditor partners
had participated in loan transactions through our platform. We currently conduct our business operations exclusively in China,
and all of our investors and borrowers are located in China.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Our online platform enables us to efficiently
match borrowers with investors and execute loan transactions. We seek to address an unmet investor and borrower demand in China.
While presently our borrowers mainly come from referrals from financial institutions and business partners, our investors come
from a variety of channels, including internet and our mobile applications, promotion through our own business development department
as well as referrals from our business partners.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Historically, we offered two types of products:
standard loans and assignment of loans, providing qualified borrowers with convenient access to affordable credit at competitive
prices and creditors with a fast and cost-efficient way to assign their existing loans for more liquidity. Our investors have the
option to individually select specific loans to invest in or to use our automated investing tool that identifies and selects loans
on the basis of an investor targeted return and risk tolerance.</P>

the loan assignment services to creditors in preparation for our record-filing under the newly promulgated regulations of the marketplace
lending industry. For more information on these regulations, see &ldquo;Business &ndash; Regulations &mdash; Regulations Related
to the Marketplace Lending Industry.&rdquo; To continue to utilize our relationship with existing creditors, whom we now refer
to as our business partners, we signed cooperation agreements with them pursuant to which these business partners introduced their
customers with financing needs to us in connection with their transactions with such customers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">In February 2018, Sichuan province issued local guidelines on the rectification and acceptance of internet
lending information intermediaries which require the guarantors for the loans facilitated by lending platforms to be guaranty institutions
or insurance companies that hold professional guaranty qualifications. Our business partners who guaranteed the loans do not hold
the guarantor qualifications. To comply with the local guidelines and also as part of our preparation for our record &ndash;filing
under the new marketplace lending regulations and as requested by the local finance bureau in connection with their inspection
of our operations, we ceased our cooperation with business partners in March 2018 and began to focus on facilitating loan transactions
solely between borrowers and investors on our platform.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">We generate revenues primarily from fees
charged for our services in matching investors with borrowers. We charge borrowers transaction fees for the work we perform through
our platform and charge our investors a service fee on their actual investment return. Previously we also generated revenue from
transaction fees from Creditor Partners in connection with the assignment of their loans on our platform.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The volume of standard loans for the three
months ended March 31, 2018 was the highest among the presented quarters, mainly attributable to the Company&rsquo;s efforts in
increasing the number of borrowers. In the contrast, the volume of standard loans for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was
the lowest, primarily due to the development, testing and integration of our platform with the system of Huaxing Bank as well
as adjustment of loan product offerings from December 2016 to February 2017.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">We started to facilitate assignment of loans from
Creditor Partners in the quarter ended June 30, 2017. However, we discontinued the offering of assigned loan products on our platform
to facilitate our record-filing under Circular 57 and the Interim Measures from January 2018. As a result, we did not have any

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The number of borrowers for the three months
ended December 31, 2017 was significantly higher than other quarters, mainly due to a trial launch of small consumer loans to individual
borrowers in October 2017, which attracted large volume of individual borrowers. However, we suspended offering these loans after
the trial due to the issues connecting to the systems of our partners who referred these borrowers. Regardless of the three months
ended December 31, 2017, the Company had a continuous increase in the number of borrowers from quarter to quarter.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">We experienced a significant and continuing
increase in the average investment amount during the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the completion of our
custody arrangement with Huaxing Bank and adjustment of loan product offerings in the prior quarter. The average investment amount
for the three months ended March 31, 2018 deceased as compared with the three months December 31, 2017, primarily caused by a decrease
in the number of investors and investment amount during February 2018 when the investors needed funds for Chinese New Year.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Caused by increasing number of individual
borrowers in the mix of borrowers and the suspension of assigned loans whose average loan amount was higher than individual loans
since January 2018, the average borrowing amount for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased as compared with the three
months ended September 30, 2017. The average borrowing amount for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased as compared with
the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to a trial launch of small consumer loans to individual borrowers in October
2017 which attracted individual borrowers who borrowed lower principals from the platform than SMEs did.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">In terms of loan amount and the number of
loans facilitated on our platform, there has not been any significant concentration on any borrower, investor, Creditor Partner
or any group of borrowers, investors or Creditor Partners. Therefore, we do not believe that our business operation or financial
position is heavily reliant upon any borrower, investor or Creditor Partner.</P>

in May 2014 and acquired by us in September 2016 and has a limited operating history. As our business develops or in response to
competition, we may introduce new products or make adjustments to our existing products, or make adjustments to our business model.
In connection with the introduction of new products or in response to general economic conditions, we may impose more stringent
borrower or creditor qualifications to ensure the quality of loans on our platform, which may negatively affect the growth of our
business. Any significant change to our business model may not achieve expected results and may have a material and adverse impact
on our financial conditions and results of operations.</P>

platform, we must continuously increase the volume of loan transactions by retaining current participants and attracting more users.
We intend to continue to dedicate resources to our user acquisition efforts, including establishing new acquisition channels, particularly
as we continue to grow our platform and introduce new products and services. We utilize online channels, such as search engine
marketing, search engine optimization and partnerships with internet companies, as well as our on-the-ground sales network for
user acquisition. If there are insufficient qualified requests for direct loans or loan assignments, investors may be unable to
deploy their capital in a timely or efficient manner and may seek other investment opportunities. If there are insufficient investor
commitments, borrowers may be unable to obtain capital through our platform and may turn to other sources for their borrowing needs.
Below are key metrics for each quarter reflecting our efforts in retaining current participants and attracting more users:</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Based on our management&rsquo;s review
of the above metrics, we believe that we do not overly rely on one type of borrowers/products for generating revenue.
Assigned loans used to account for a large portion of our revenue and revenue from individual borrowers has increased in the
quarter ended March 31, 2018 due to our arrangement with our business partners. As a result of the cessation of our
relationship with our Creditor Partners and business partners, we expect the revenue from individual borrowers to decrease
and fees from SME loans to constitute a larger percentage of our revenue mix in 2018 before we effectively increase the
number of individual borrowers on our own.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">As compared with the quarter ended
March 31, 2017, the average customer acquisition cost continuously decreased for the period through June 30, 2017, which was
primarily due to (i) the temporary suspension of marketing activities from December 2016 to February 2017 when we updated and
integrated our system with Huaxing Bank; (ii) the implementation of our cost efficient user acquisition strategy through
cooperation with Resgreen and (iii) a decrease in offline marketing expenses as a result of the Interim Measures. The average
customer acquisition cost for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 was higher than prior quarters,
as we increased our marketing efforts to further expand our borrower and investor base. Because our marketing efforts were
primarily targeted on maintenance of existing customers during Chinese New Year, we did not attract as many new customers as
the prior quarters, thus the average customer acquisition cost for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was the highest
among all the quarters.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">We believe that our current acquisition cost
is below the average cost per person of the peer-to-peer lending industry in China. As we continue to grow our borrower and investor
base, we anticipate such costs will increase, which may go above industry level if our customer acquisition strategy turns out
to be inefficient under future market conditions.</P>

fees from borrowers and service fees from investors by providing services in matching investors with borrowers on our platform.
For the year ended March 31, 2018, we charged borrowers transaction fees ranging from 0.30% to 2.98% of the loan amount for standard
loans and from 0.32% to 0.94% for assigned loans, which fees were paid (i) upon disbursement of the proceeds for loans accruing
interest on a monthly basis and (ii) upon full payment of principal and interest of loans accruing interest on a daily basis. The
transaction fee rate charged to borrowers varied based on the amount and term of loan facilitated.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Since the Company started its operations
in October 2016 and started facilitating loan assignments on its platform since April 2017, the Company witnessed a dramatic increase
in revenues during the year ended March 31, 2018 as compared with the same period ended March 31, 2017.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The amount of transaction fees earned is
determined by the term and amount of loan facilitated. We generally charge borrowers higher transaction fees for loans with longer
terms and higher principals. During the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the transactions fees from borrowers averaged 0.41%
and 0.89% of the total loan amounts, respectively. The decrease in the average transaction fee percentage was primarily a result
of increase in number of borrowers with short term loans and low transaction fees due to the Company&rsquo;s trial launch of small
consumer loans to individual borrowers in October 2017 and the suspension of assigned loan service since January 2018, which services
involved longer term of loans and higher transaction fee rates.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Transaction fees from borrowers accounted
for 37.5% and 72.2% of our total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decreased percentage was
due to the additional revenue the Company generated through loan assignments since the April 2017. Due to the discontinuation
of cooperation with our business partners, we expect our transaction fees earned from borrowers to decrease before we can effectively
increase the number of borrowers on our own. However, as a result of the cessation of our loan assignment services, we expect
transaction fees earned from borrowers as a percentage of total revenue to increase in the next 12 months, in particular when
we further grow the number of borrowers and introduce new loan products and services on our platform.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">The transaction fees earned from Creditor
Partners are charged on the total assigned loan amounts, ranging from 0.32% to 0.94%. The amount of transaction fees earned is
determined by the term and total amount of loans assigned. We generally charge Creditor Partners higher transaction fees for loans
with longer terms and higher principals. During the year ended March 31, 2018, the transaction fees from Creditor Partners averaged
0.57% of the total assigned loan amounts. Transaction fees from Creditor Partners accounted for 27.8% of our total revenue for
the year ended March 31, 2018. Due to the discontinuation of loan assignment service, we expect that both our transaction fees
earned from Creditor Partners and transaction fees earned from Creditor Partners as a percentage of total revenue will decrease
to zero in the next 12 months</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Service fee charged to investors is equal
to 8.00% of the interest that investors receive, and is paid at the time of each interest payment. Service fees from investors
accounted for 34.7% and 22.8% of our total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in
percentage was due to the increase in both investment amount per investor and the number of investors resulting from the Company&rsquo;s
marketing activities and increased market awareness of the Company. We may adjust the interest rates on the loan products based
on market rates from time to time, which will likely affect the service fee we receive from investors. However, in light of our
business expansion, we generally expect service fees from investors to increase in the next 12 months.</P>

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates

if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting
policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results of operations and require management's
difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their
significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly
from management's current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates
and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.</P>

consideration over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired
entity or business as a result of the Company&rsquo;s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiaries and VIE and business. Goodwill
is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that it might be impaired. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step
quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers primary factors such as industry and
market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations.
Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than the
carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is performed.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">In performing the two-step quantitative impairment
test, the first step compares the fair values of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value
of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required.
If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill
to the carrying value of a reporting unit&rsquo;s goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar
to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets
and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets
and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This allocation process is only performed for the purposes of evaluating
goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities. Application of a goodwill
impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets, liabilities
and goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: justify">We conducted our audits in accordance
with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
The Company was not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits include </FONT>examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also include
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>

an online lending platform through its variable interest entity (&ldquo;VIE&rdquo;), Sichuan Senmiao Ronglian Technology Co., Ltd.
(&ldquo;Sichuan Senmiao&rdquo;) in China connecting Chinese investors with individual and small- to-medium-sized enterprise (&ldquo;SME&rdquo;)
borrowers. Through its platform, the Company offers quick and easy access to credit to borrowers and creditors and attractive investment
returns for investors. The Company<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;</FONT>s executive offices are

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On July 28, 2017, the Company established
a wholly owned subsidiary, Sichuan Senmiao Zecheng Business Consulting Co., Ltd. (&ldquo;WFOE,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Senmiao Consulting&rdquo;)

in June 2014. On September 18, 2017, the Company entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Sichuan Senmiao and its
equity holders (&ldquo;Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders&rdquo;)through WFOE to obtain control and became the primary beneficiary of
Sichuan Senmiao (the &ldquo;Restructuring&rdquo;). In connection with the Restructuring, as partial consideration for Sichuan Senmiao
Shareholders&rsquo;commitment to perform their obligations under a series of contractual arrangements, the Company issued an aggregate
of 45,000,000 shares of its common stock to Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders pursuant to certain subscription agreements dated September
18, 2017.</P>

board of directors and stockholders approved a one-for-two reverse stock split of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock
(the &ldquo;Reverse Stock Split&rdquo;). As a result, the number of the Company&rsquo;s issued and outstanding shares of common
stock was reduced to 22,500,000 shares. The discussion and presentation of financial statements herein accounted for the Restructuring
retroactively as if it occurred on April 1, 2015.</P>

acquired a peer-to-peer platform (including website, ICP license, operating systems, servers, and management system) from Sichuan
Chenghexin Investment and Asset Management Co., Ltd. (&ldquo;Chenghexin&rdquo;), who had established and operated the platform
for two years prior to the acquisition by Sichuan Senmiao (the &ldquo;Acquisition&rdquo;). Prior to the Acquisition, Sichuan Senmiao
was a holding company that owned a 60% equity interest in an equity investment fund management company. Sichuan Senmiao sold its
60% equity interest for a cash consideration of RMB 60,000,000 (US$8,914,833) immediately following the Acquisition, in order to
focus on the online marketplace lending business.</P>

requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews these estimates
and assumptions using the currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may cause the Company to revise its
estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The following are
some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates: determinations of the useful lives of long-lived assets, estimates
of allowances for doubtful accounts and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long-lived assets and goodwill,
and determination of fair value of net identifiable assets in a business acquisition.</P>

on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions

consideration over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquired
entity or business as a result of the Company&rsquo;s acquisitions of interests in its subsidiary, VIE and business. Goodwill is
not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that it might be impaired. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step
quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the qualitative assessment, the Company considers primary factors such as industry and
market considerations, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and other specific information related to the operations.
Based on the qualitative assessment, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than the
carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is performed.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In performing the two-step quantitative
impairment test, the first step compares the fair values of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If
the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step
will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair
value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit&rsquo;s goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first
step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned
to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This allocation process is only performed for the purposes
of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities. Application
of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning
assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued ASU No. 2014-09, &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU
2014-09&rdquo;). ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when
it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The guidance also
requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
contracts. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including
interim reporting periods within those periods), which means it became effective for the Company&rsquo;s fiscal year beginning
April 1, 2018. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, &ldquo;Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue
versus Net)&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2016-08&rdquo;), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations
in the new revenue recognition standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, &ldquo;Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2016-10&rdquo;), which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance
obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-12 &ldquo;Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients&rdquo; (&ldquo;ASU 2016-12&rdquo;), which amends the
guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. In December
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, &ldquo;Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers&rdquo;
(&ldquo;ASU 2016-20&rdquo;), which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have
a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. The amendments
are intended to address implementation and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying
the new revenue standard. These amendments have the same effective date as the new revenue standard. The Company planned to adopt
Topic 606 in the first quarter of its fiscal year beginning April 1, 2018 using the retrospective transition method. The Company&rsquo;s
current revenue recognition policies are generally consistent with the new revenue recognition standards set forth in ASU 2014-09.
Potential adjustments to input measures are not expected to be pervasive to the majority of the Company&rsquo;s contracts. The
adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.
The Company will make further assessment at adoption based upon outstanding contracts at that time. In September 2017, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-13, &ldquo;Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to the Staff Announcement at the
July 20, 2017 EITF Meeting and Rescission of Prior SEC Staff Announcements and Observer Comments.&rdquo; The amendments in ASU
No. 2017-13 amends the early adoption date option for certain companies related to the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. The Company

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,
Financial Instruments &ndash; Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,
to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information.
The update requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation
of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. It eliminated the requirement
for public entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be
disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. The ASU is effective for the fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this ASU is not expected
to have a material effect on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
Amendments to the ASC 842 Leases. This update requires the lessee to recognize the assets and liability (the lease liability) arising
from operating leases on the balance sheet for the lease term. When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, a lessee
(and a lessor) should include payments to be made in optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option
to extend the lease or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. Within twelve months or less lease term, a lessee is permitted
to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should
recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In transition, this update will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is evaluating the effect, if
any, on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.</P>

Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,
to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
The amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs;
(2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation
to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; (4) Proceeds
from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including
Bank-Owned; (6) Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; (8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization
Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period
presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues
would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Management is evaluating the effect, if any, on the Company&rsquo;s
consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on
its consolidated financial statements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">During the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2017,
the Company sold its 60% equity interest in Zhongyi Yinfeng Investment Management Co., Ltd. (Zhongyi Yinfeng), to an unrelated
third party, for a cash consideration of RMB 60,000,000 (equivalent of&thinsp;&thinsp; $8.9 million). For disposal transactions
that occur on or after April&nbsp;1, 2015, a component of the Company is reported in discontinued operations after meeting the
criteria for held-for-sale classification if the disposition represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect
on the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial results. The Company analyzed the quantitative and qualitative factors relevant
to the disposal of equity interest in Zhongyi Yinfeng and determined the criteria for held-for-sale classification have been met,
and the transaction represents a strategic shift where the Company is exiting the private equity investment, which will have a
major effect on the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial results going forward. As such, the financial results of Zhongyi Yinfeng
are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements and amounts
previously reported have been reclassified, as necessary, to allow for meaningful comparison of continuing operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As of September&nbsp;30, 2016, the date
of completion of the disposal, the net asset of Zhongyi Yinfeng amounted to approximately $15.0 million and the non-controlling
interest amounted to approximately $6.0 million. As a result, the Company recorded a loss of $64,968 on the sale of Zhongyi Yinfeng,
in which the Company held a 60% equity interest.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act of 2017 (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include,
but are not limited to, a U.S. corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31,
2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition
tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. As the Company has a March 31
fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately
31.5% for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. Accordingly, the Company has to remeasure
it deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforward in the U.S and concluded no effect on the Company&rsquo;s income tax
expenses as the Company has no deferred tax assets generated since inception.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Additionally, the Tax Act imposes a one-time
transition tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and future foreign earnings are subject to
U.S. taxation. The change in rate has caused the Company to remeasure all U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary
differences and NOL carryforwards and recorded one time income tax payable to be paid in 8 years. However, this one-time transition
tax has no effect on the Company&rsquo;s income tax expenses as the Company has no undistributed foreign earnings prior to March
31, 2018, as the Company has cumulative foreign losses as of March 31, 2018.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Company's net operating loss for the
year ended March 31, 2018 amounted to approximately $0.2 million. As of March 31, 2018, the Company&rsquo;s net operating loss
carry forward for United States income taxes was approximately $0.2 million. The net operating loss carry forwards are available
to reduce future years' taxable income through year 2037. Management believes that the realization of the benefit from this loss
appears uncertain due to the Company's operating history. Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance on the
deferred tax asset to reduce the deferred tax assets to zero. As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets was approximately $0.04 million and nil, respectively. Management reviews this valuation allowance periodically and makes
changes accordingly</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 20pt">Our Board of Directors has determined that
each of Mr. Davis, Ms. Lin and Dr. Rao qualifies as an &quot;independent director&quot; under the Nasdaq listing rules, which is
defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having
a relationship, which, in the opinion of the company's board of directors would interfere with the director's exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at
which only independent directors are present.&nbsp;</P>
