<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In May 2019, our sponsor purchased an aggregate
of 8,625,000 shares of Class B common stock (our &ldquo;founder shares&rdquo;) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately
$0.003 per share. Our Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis,
upon the completion of a business combination. On June 7, 2019, we effected a stock dividend at one-third of one share of Class
B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 11,500,000 founder shares outstanding.
On June 26, 2019, we effected a further stock dividend of one-half of a share of Class B common stock for each outstanding share
of Class B common stock, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 17,250,000 founder Shares. All share and per-share amounts
have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock dividends. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the
expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and our Class B common
stock (collectively, our &ldquo;common stock&rsquo;) upon completion of the initial public offering (the &ldquo;IPO&rdquo;).</P>

able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such

so that the post-transaction company in which holders (our &ldquo;public stockholders&rdquo;) of our Class A common stock sold
as part of the units in the IPO (the &ldquo;public shares&rdquo;), including our sponsor, officers and directors to the extent
our sponsor, officers or directors own public shares, provided that each of their status as a &ldquo;public stockholder&rdquo;
shall only exist with respect to their public shares, will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of
the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company
owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target
management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction
company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest
in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting
securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in
the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction.
For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the
issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own
less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity
interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such
business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial
business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of
all of the target businesses.</P>

requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with
our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to
amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. If we structure a business

of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause
our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not
then become subject to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which
may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than
we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek
stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder,
together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo;
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than
an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO, without our prior consent, which we refer to as the &ldquo;Excess Shares.&rdquo;
We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such
holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us
or our affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms.
Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO could threaten
to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&rsquo;s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or our affiliates at a premium
to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to redeem no more than
15% of the shares sold in the IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt
to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with
a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not
be restricting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial
business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We may require our public stockholders seeking
to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &ldquo;street name,&rdquo; to either
tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed
to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event
we distribute proxy materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company&rsquo;s
DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination at the holder&rsquo;s
option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection
with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements,
which will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify
itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender
offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination
if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant
to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote,
a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect
that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice
of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it
is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">There is a nominal cost associated with
the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust
Company&rsquo;s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00
and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred
regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver
shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The foregoing is different from the procedures
used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many
blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders&rsquo; vote on an initial business combination, and
a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was
seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder
to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an &ldquo;option
window&rdquo; after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&rsquo;s
stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before
actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders
were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become &ldquo;option&rdquo; rights surviving past the completion
of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery
prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder&rsquo;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is
approved.</P>

made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting
set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection
with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights,
such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated
that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after
the completion of our initial business combination.</P>

service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities
with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies
held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements
or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but
not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging
the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including
the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held
in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement
with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&rsquo;s engagement would be significantly
more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute
a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to
be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to
find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive
any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and
will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our
sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered
public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed
entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.00 per public share or
(2) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less
than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of permitted withdrawals, except as
to any claims by a third party that executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or
not such waiver is enforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient
funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities of our company and,
therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations.
Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were
successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be
reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and
you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers will
indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</P>

assets, in each case net of permitted withdrawals, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations
or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether
to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent
directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible
that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in certain instances. For example,
the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the
independent directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims
of creditors the actual value of the per share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. Please see

business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.
Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2019, we had access to approximately $695,295,400 in the trust
account with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation,
currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined
that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable
for claims made by creditors.</P>

liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The
pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window may be considered a liquidating distribution under
Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that
it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can
be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional
150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect
to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed
to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.</P>

our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete
our initial business combination within the completion window, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law
and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations
for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case
of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, we will:
(1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business
days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the trust account, including interest (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses),
divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&rsquo;
rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and
(3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our
board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of
creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as
reasonably possible following July 1, 2021 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders
could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our
stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.</P>

280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our

However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching
for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment
bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement,
we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective
target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or

our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities

likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective

exchange listing requirements or if we decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons. For instance, the NYSE
rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder
approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business
combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding
shares, we would seek stockholder approval of such business combination. However, except as required by applicable law or stock
exchange rules, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders
to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors,
such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval.
Even if we seek stockholder approval, the holders of our founder shares will participate in the vote on such approval. Accordingly,
we may consummate our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our outstanding public shares do not approve
of the business combination we consummate. Please see &ldquo;Item 1. Business &mdash; Stockholders may not have the ability to

and outstanding shares are voted) in order to have such initial business combination approved. We expect that our initial stockholders
and their permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock at the time of any such stockholder
vote. Accordingly, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder
approval will be received than would be the case if our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees agreed to vote their
founder shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public stockholders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We may seek to enter into a business combination
transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition
and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions
payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with a business combination and
such amount of deferred underwriting discount is not available for us to use as consideration in an initial business combination.
Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment
of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC&rsquo;s
 &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement
relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause
our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described
above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business
combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination
transaction with us. If we are able to consummate an initial business combination, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming
stockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">At the time we enter into an agreement for
our initial business combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights and, therefore, we
will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption.
If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase
price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account
to meet such requirements or arrange for third-party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares is submitted for redemption
than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account
or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence
of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution
provision of the Class B common stock results in the issuance of shares of Class A common stock on a greater than one-to-one basis
upon conversion of the Class B common stock at the time of our initial business combination. In addition, the amount of deferred
underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters is not required to be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection
with an initial business combination. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination
available to us or optimize our capital structure.</P>

While we believe there will be numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the

so. Please see &ldquo;Item 1. Business &mdash; Certain Potential Conflicts of Interest Relating to M. Klein and Company&rdquo;

from &ldquo;shopping&rdquo; around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses)
with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered
into a letter of intent or merger agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were

respective affiliates is under any obligation or other duty to loan funds to us in such circumstances. Any such loans would be
repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination.
If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will
be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In such case, our public stockholders may receive only $10.00 per

be present with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount
of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of
these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other
charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected
risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even
though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of
this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may
cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a
target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders
who choose to remain a stockholder or warrant holder following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the
value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our placing of funds in the trust account
may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other
than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business
execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account
for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements
they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement,
breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in
each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account.
If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management
will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has
not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&rsquo;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to
us than any alternative. Making such a request of potential target businesses may make our acquisition proposal less attractive
to them and, to the extent prospective target businesses refuse to execute such a waiver, it may limit the field of potential target
businesses that we might pursue. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver
include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly
superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider
willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have
in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against
the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination
within the completion window, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we
will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10
years following redemption. Accordingly, the per share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the
$10.00 per share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors.</P>

as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity
obligations and we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to
reserve for such obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available

legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors
would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that
our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in certain instances. For example, the
cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the independent

Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held
liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The
pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window may be considered a liquidating distribution under
Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it
makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can
be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional
150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect
to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed
to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However,
it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 24<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">th
</FONT>month from the closing of the IPO in the event we do not complete our initial business combination and, therefore, we do
not intend to comply with the foregoing procedures.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Because we do not intend to comply with
Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide
for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following
our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited
to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers,
investment bankers, consultants, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b)
of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s
pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be
barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be
potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions
received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore,
if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in
the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window is not considered a liquidating distribution
under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute
of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years,
as in the case of a liquidating distribution.</P>

60 business days following our initial business combination to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance

for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement

we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for
cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless
the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising
holder or an exemption from registration or qualification is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A common stock
is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition
of a &ldquo;covered security&rdquo; under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public
warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a &ldquo;cashless basis&rdquo; in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities
Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will

not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange
for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state
securities laws and no exemption is available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered
or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant
and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase
of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of Class A common stock included in the units. If and

and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register the resale of such
warrants or the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities.
The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse
effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial
business combination more costly or difficult to complete. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase
the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market
price of our Class A common stock that is expected when the common stock owned by our initial stockholders or their permitted transferees,
the private placement warrants owned by our sponsor or warrants issued in connection with working capital loans are registered

company&rsquo;s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a

affiliate of our sponsor, as a financial advisor in connection with our initial business combination and pay such affiliate a customary
financial advisory fee in an amount that constitutes a market standard financial advisory fee for comparable transactions. Pursuant
to any such engagement, the affiliate may earn its fee upon closing of the initial business combination. The payment of such fee
would likely be conditioned upon the completion of the initial business combination. Therefore, our sponsor may have additional
financial interests in the completion of the initial business combination. These financial interests may influence the advice any
such affiliate provides us as our financial advisor, which advice would contribute to our decision on whether to pursue a business
combination with any particular target.</P>

of 8,625,000 shares of our founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Our Class
B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis, upon the completion of a
business combination. On June 7, 2019, we effected a stock dividend at one-third of one share of Class B common stock for each
outstanding share of Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 11,500,000 founder shares outstanding. On June 26, 2019,
we effected a further stock dividend of one-half of a share of Class B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common
stock, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 17,250,000 founder Shares. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively
restated to reflect the stock dividends. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder
shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock upon the completion of the IPO. The founder shares will be
worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination.</P>

one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein.</P>

50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business
sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider
any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities
of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post
business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination. For example,
we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of
a substantial number of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than
a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may
subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&rsquo;s stock
than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control
of the target business.</P>

incorporation provides that any of its provisions (other than amendments relating to the appointment of directors, which require
the approval by a majority of at least 90% of our common stock voting at a stockholder meeting) related to pre-business combination
activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of the IPO and the private placement warrants into the trust account and
not release such amounts except in specified circumstances and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described
herein) may be amended if approved by holders of at least 65% of our common stock, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement
governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock. In all
other instances, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that it may be amended by holders of a majority
of our common stock, subject to applicable provisions of the DGCL, or applicable stock exchange rules. We may not issue additional
securities that can vote on amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or on our initial business combination.
Our initial stockholders, who beneficially own 20% of our common stock, may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result,
we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which will govern our pre-business

business combination with which you do not agree. Our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended

Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public

JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply

transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private

burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business
combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls.
The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time
and costs necessary to complete any such initial business combination.</P>

of 8,625,000 shares of our founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Our Class
B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis, upon the completion of a
business combination. On June 7, 2019, we effected a stock dividend at one-third of one share of Class B common stock for each
outstanding share of Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 11,500,000 founder shares outstanding. On June 26, 2019,
we effected a further stock dividend of one-half of a share of Class B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common
stock, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 17,250,000 founder Shares. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively
restated to reflect the stock dividends. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder
shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock upon completion of
the IPO.</P>

shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-third of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder
thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments. Following
the closing of the IPO, an aggregate of $690,000,000 was placed in the trust account.</P>

Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated
to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional
securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we
would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete
our business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate
the trust account. In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional
financing in order to meet our obligations.</P>

at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within
the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified
as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders&rsquo; equity. Our common stock features certain
redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly,
common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders&rsquo;

value, has been excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per common share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate
in their pro rata share of the trust account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable

are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act,

and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal
financial and accounting officer (our &ldquo;Certifying Officers&rdquo;), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of December 31, 2019, pursuant to Rule&nbsp;13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers

and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures
are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures,
no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies
and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In May 2019, our sponsor purchased an aggregate
of 8,625,000 shares of our founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Our Class
B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis, upon the completion of a
business combination. On June 7, 2019, we effected a stock dividend at one-third of one share of Class B common stock for each
outstanding share of Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 11,500,000 founder shares outstanding. On June 26, 2019,
we effected a further stock dividend of one-half of a share of Class B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common
stock, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 17,250,000 founder Shares. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively
restated to reflect the stock dividends. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder
shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock upon the completion of the IPO. The purchase price of the
founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to us by the number of founder shares issued.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">We have entered into an Administrative Services
Agreement pursuant to which we will also pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space, administrative
and support services. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our sponsor, officers and directors or any
of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our
behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit
committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or any
of their respective affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no
cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, in order to finance transaction
costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and
directors may, but none of them is obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination,
we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into
warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement
warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors,
if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from
parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties
will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.</P>

private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($15,800,000 in the aggregate) in a private placement that occurred
simultaneously with the closing of the IPO. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of
our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein. Our sponsor is permitted to
transfer the private placement warrants held by it to certain permitted transferees, including our officers and directors and other
persons or entities affiliated with or related to them, but the transferees receiving such securities will be subject to the same
agreements with respect to such securities as our sponsor. Otherwise, these warrants are not, subject to certain limited exceptions,
transferable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The private placement warrants
are non-redeemable so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees (subject to certain limited exceptions).
The private placement warrants may also be exercised by our sponsor or its permitted transferees for cash or on a cashless basis.
Otherwise, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants sold as part of
the units in the IPO.</P>

securities held by them for sale under the Securities Act and to have the securities covered thereby registered for resale pursuant
to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders have the right to include their securities in other registration
statements filed by us. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement
filed under the Securities Act to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions,

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed
into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public
companies. We will qualify as an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new
or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to
delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards
on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective
dates.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating
the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set
forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo;, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required
to, among other things: (1) provide an auditor&rsquo;s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging
growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (3) comply with any requirement that
may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor&rsquo;s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and (4) disclose certain executive
compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO&rsquo;s
compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of
our IPO or until we are no longer an &ldquo;emerging growth company,&rdquo; whichever is earlier.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Our board of directors consists of six members.
Holders of our founder shares will have the right to elect all of our directors prior to consummation of our initial business combination
and holders of our public shares will not have the right to vote on the election of directors during such time. These provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended if approved by a majority of at least 90% of our common
stock voting at a stockholder meeting. Approval of our initial business combination will require the affirmative vote of a majority
of our board directors, including the two director nominees of our sponsor. Our board of directors is divided into three classes
with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first
annual meeting of stockholders) serving a three-year term. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Malcolm
S. McDermid and Glenn R. August, will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the second class
of directors, consisting of Mark Klein and Karen G. Mills, will expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders. The term of
office of the third class of directors, consisting of Michael Klein and Jeremy Paul Abson, will expire at the third annual meeting
of stockholders. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we consummate our initial business combination.
Subject to any other special rights applicable to the stockholders, any vacancies on our board of directors may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present and voting at the meeting of our board that includes any directors representing
our sponsor then on our board, or by a majority of the holders of our founder shares.</P>

is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time, because the directors of the post-combination business will

completion of our initial business combination will be determined by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent

Agreement pursuant to which we will also pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space, administrative
and support services. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees. Accordingly, in the event the consummation of our initial business combination takes the maximum 27 months, an affiliate
of our sponsor will be paid a total of $540,000 ($20,000 per month) for office space, administrative and support services and will
be entitled to be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses.</P>

committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or any
of their respective affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no
cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.</P>

costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and
directors may, but none of them is obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination,
we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into
warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement
warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors,
if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from
parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties
will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.</P>

the holders have certain &ldquo;piggy-back&rdquo; registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent
to our completion of our initial business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant
to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration

(i) in the case of the founder shares, on the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of our initial business combination

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We have audited the
accompanying balance sheet of Churchill Capital Corp II (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31, 2019, the related statements
of operations, changes in stockholders&rsquo; equity and cash flows for the period from April 11, 2019 (inception) through December
31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the period from April 11, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s financial
statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of
our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our audit included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

Corp II (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated in Delaware on April 11, 2019. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting
a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or
more businesses (the &ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

2019, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from April 11, 2019 (inception) through December
31, 2019 relates to the Company&rsquo;s formation, the initial public offering (&ldquo;Initial Public Offering&rdquo;), which is
described below, and identifying a target for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until
after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the
form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.</P>

for the Company&rsquo;s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on June 26, 2019. On July 1, 2019, the Company consummated
the Initial Public Offering of 69,000,000 units (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo; and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock
included in the Units sold, the &ldquo;Public Shares&rdquo;), which includes the full exercise by the underwriter of the over-allotment
option to purchase an additional 9,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $690,000,000, which is described
in Note 3.</P>

Warrants&rdquo;) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Churchill Sponsor II LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the &ldquo;Sponsor&rdquo;), generating gross proceeds of $15,800,000, which is described in Note 4.</P>

amounted to $34,319,807 consisting of $12,212,000 of underwriting discount, $21,371,000 of deferred underwriting discount and $736,807

for working capital purposes.</P>

of the Initial Public Offering on July 1, 2019, an amount of $690,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of
the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the &ldquo;Trust
Account&rdquo;) and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act, with a maturity of 185&nbsp;days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money
market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company,
until the earlier of: (i)&nbsp;the completion of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described
below, except that interest earned on the Trust Account can be released to the Company to fund working capital requirements, subject
to an annual limit of&thinsp; $250,000 and to pay its tax obligations.</P>

management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and
the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally
toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination
successfully. The Company must complete an initial Business Combination having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of
the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the agreement
to enter into the initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company
owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in
the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the &ldquo;Investment Company Act&rdquo;).</P>

its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the &ldquo;public stockholders&rdquo;) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion
of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i)&nbsp;in connection with a stockholder meeting called
to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder
approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public
stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro&nbsp;rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account
($10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro&nbsp;rata interest, net of amounts withdrawn for working capital requirements, subject to
an annual limit of&thinsp; $250,000 and to pay its taxes (&ldquo;permitted withdrawals&rdquo;)). The per-share amount to be distributed
to public stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company
will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination
with respect to the Company&rsquo;s warrants.</P>

If a stockholder vote is not required by law or stock exchange requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder

the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing
a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain
stockholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation
pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection
with a Business Combination, the Company&rsquo;s Sponsor and its permitted transferees have agreed to vote their Founder Shares
(as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business
Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for
or against the proposed transaction.</P>

in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the

available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">In order to protect
the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a
third party (other than the Company&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold
to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality
or similar agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.00 per Public Share or (ii) the amount
per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per Public Shares due
to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of permitted withdrawals. This liability will not apply with
respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account or to any
claims under the Company&rsquo;s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;). Moreover, in the event that an executed
waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust
Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other
entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.</P>

that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions

until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not
have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt
out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates
for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time
private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements with
another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using
the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</P>

redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events
not solely within the Company&rsquo;s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified
as stockholders&rsquo; equity. The Company&rsquo;s Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered
to be outside of the Company&rsquo;s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject

carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the&nbsp;years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets

a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statements recognition and measurement of tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as
of December 31, 2019. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments,
accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities

is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The
Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption at
December 31, 2019, which are not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation
of basic net income per common share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account
earnings. The Company has not considered the effect of warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and the private placement to
purchase 38,800,000 shares of common stock in the calculation of diluted income per share, since the exercise of the warrants are
contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As a result, diluted net income per common share is the same as basic net income
per common share for the periods presented.</P>
