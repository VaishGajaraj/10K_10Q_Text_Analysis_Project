ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

     ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM") is the largest facility services
contractor listed on the New York Stock Exchange. With annual revenues exceeding
$1.8 billion and more than 60,000 employees, ABM and its subsidiaries (the
"Company") provide air conditioning, elevator, engineering, janitorial,
lighting, parking and security services to thousands of commercial, industrial
and institutional customers in hundreds of cities across North America.

     ABM was reincorporated in Delaware on March 19, 1985, as the successor to a
business founded in California in 1909. The Corporate Headquarters of the
Company are located at 160 Pacific Avenue, Suite 222, San Francisco, California
94111, and its telephone number is 415/733-4000.

INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION

     The Company's operations are grouped into nine industry segments or
divisions (comprised of one or more subsidiaries of the Company). Referred to as
"ABM Industries Incorporated Family of Services," they are listed below by their
respective division name:

<TABLE>
<S>                          <C>
- ABM Engineering Services   - Amtech Elevator Services
- ABM Janitorial Services    - Amtech Lighting Services
- ABM Service Network        - CommAir Mechanical
- American Commercial          Services
  Security Services          - Easterday Janitorial
- Ampco System Parking         Supply Company
</TABLE>

     Additional information relating to the Company's industry segments appears
in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8,
"Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule." The business activities
of the Company's industry segments, as they existed at October 31, 2000, are
more fully described below.

          - ABM ENGINEERING SERVICES provides building owners and managers with
     on-site engineers to operate, maintain and repair electrical, energy
     management, mechanical, and plumbing systems utilizing computerized
     maintenance management systems (CMMS). This service is primarily for
     high-rise office buildings, but customers also include schools, warehouses,
     factories, shopping malls and universities. ABM Engineering Services
     operates in 21 states through eight regional offices, two of which are in
     California and one each in Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado;
     Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; New York, New York; and Phoenix, Arizona. In
     1999, this Division earned ISO 9002 Certification, the first national
     engineering services provider of on-site operating engineers to earn this
     exclusive designation. ISO is a quality standard comprised of a rigorous
     set of guidelines and good business practices against which companies are
     rated through a comprehensive independent audit process that can take
     several years.

          - ABM JANITORIAL SERVICES (also known as "American Building
     Maintenance") provides a wide range of basic janitorial services for a
     variety of structures and organizations, including office buildings,
     industrial plants, banks, department stores, theaters, warehouses,
     educational and health institutions and airport terminals. Services
     provided include floor cleaning and finishing, wall and window washing,
     furniture polishing, rug cleaning, dusting, as well as other building
     cleaning services. ABM Janitorial Services maintains 93 offices in 36
     states, the District of Columbia and one Canadian province, and operates
     under thousands of individually negotiated building maintenance contracts,
     the majority of which are obtained by competitive bidding. Generally,
     profit margins on maintenance contracts tend to be inversely proportional
     to the size of the contract. Although many of this Division's maintenance
     contracts are fixed-price agreements, others contain clauses under which
     the customer agrees to reimburse the full amount of wages, payroll taxes,
     insurance charges and other expenses plus a profit percentage. The majority
     of ABM Janitorial Services contracts are for one-year periods, contain
     automatic renewal clauses and are subject to termination by either party
     upon 30 to 90 days written notice.

          - ABM SERVICE NETWORK provides customers with streamlined, centralized
     control and coordination of multiple facility service needs. This process
     is consistent with the greater competitive demands on corporate
     organizations to become more efficient in the business market today. By
     leveraging the core competencies of the Company's other affiliated
     divisions, this Division attempts to reduce overhead, such as redundant
     personnel, for its customers by providing multiple services under a single
     contract, with one contact

                                        3
<PAGE>   4

     and one invoice. Its National Service Center provides centralized
     dispatching, emergency services, accounting and related reports to
     financial institutions, high-tech companies, and other customers regardless
     of industry or size. ABM Service Network is headquartered in San Francisco,
     where it also maintains its National Service Center.

          - AMERICAN COMMERCIAL SECURITY SERVICES(also known as "ACSS" and "ABM
     Security Services") provides security guards, electric monitoring of fire,
     life, safety, and access control devices, and security consulting services
     to a wide range of businesses in the major metropolitan areas of Phoenix,
     Arizona; San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles, California; Chicago,
     Illinois; New Orleans, Louisiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Portland, Oregon;
     Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, Texas; Seattle,
     Washington; and Salt Lake City, Utah. Much like ABM Janitorial Services,
     the majority of this Division's contracts are for one-year periods, contain
     automatic renewal clauses and are subject to termination by either party
     upon 30 to 90 days written notice.

          - AMPCO SYSTEM PARKING (also known as "Ampco System Airport Parking"
     and "Ampco Express Airport Parking") operates approximately 1,500 parking
     lots and garages, which are either leased from or operated through
     management contracts for third parties. The lease terms generally range
     from 5 to 20 years and usually contain provisions for renewal options.
     Leases which expire may continue on a month-to-month basis or may be
     replaced by similar leases. Many leases contain provisions for contingent
     rentals based on revenues. Ampco System Parking currently operates in 29
     states and five of the 20 busiest international airports in the U.S.:
     Denver, Colorado; Honolulu, Hawaii; Newark, New Jersey; Phoenix, Arizona;
     and San Francisco, California. In conjunction with its on-airport parking
     services, this Division also operates off-airport parking facilities in
     Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Houston, Texas; and Los Angeles, California,
     and parking shuttle bus services at thirteen locations.

          - AMTECH ELEVATOR SERVICES maintains, modernizes and repairs elevators
     and escalators in major metropolitan areas of California; Houston, Texas;
     Cincinnati, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; Las Vegas,
     Nevada; Pennsauken, New Jersey; Atlanta, Georgia; Philadelphia,
     Pennsylvania; Phoenix, Arizona; Denver, Colorado; Chicago, Illinois; and
     Washington, D.C. Amtech Elevator Services maintains 17 offices and several
     parts warehouses, and operates a fleet of radio-equipped service vehicles.

          - AMTECH LIGHTING SERVICES (also known as "Sica Lighting & Electrical
     Services") provides relamping, fixture cleaning and periodic maintenance
     service to a variety of commercial customers. Amtech Lighting Services also
     repairs, services, designs and installs outdoor signage. This Division
     maintains 26 offices, eight of which are located in California; four of
     which are in Texas; and one office in each of the following states:
     Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland,
     Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Washington.

          - COMMAIR MECHANICAL SERVICES (also known as "CommAir Preferred
     Mechanical Services") installs, maintains, and repairs heating, ventilation
     and air conditioning equipment, performs chemical water treatment, and
     provides energy conservation services for commercial, industrial and
     institutional facilities. CommAir Mechanical Services maintains ten
     offices, nine of which are located in California, and one in Phoenix,
     Arizona.

          - EASTERDAY JANITORIAL SUPPLY markets janitorial supplies and
     equipment through six sales offices located in San Francisco, Los Angeles
     and Sacramento, California; Portland, Oregon; Reno, Nevada; and Houston,
     Texas. Aside from sales to ABM Janitorial Services, which, in 2000,
     accounted for approximately 27% of Easterday Janitorial Supply's total
     revenues, the principal customers for this Division are industrial plants,
     schools, commercial buildings, industrial organizations, transportation
     terminals, theaters, hotels, retail stores, restaurants, military
     establishments and janitorial service companies. Among the products sold
     are cleaning equipment, disinfectants, floor cleaners, floor finishes,
     glass cleaners, paper products and polishes. The products sold include many
     nationally advertised brands. This Division blends certain cleaning agents
     and floor finishes, which it sells under the Easterday trade name.

     Supply also provides sanitation services to the food industry.

TRADEMARKS

     The Company believes that it owns or is licensed to use all corporate
names, trade names, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents and trade
secrets which are material to the Company's operations.

COMPETITION

     The Company believes that each aspect of its business is highly
competitive, and that such competition is based primarily on price and quality
of service. Nearly all services provided by the Company are under contracts
originally obtained through competitive bidding. The Company's competitors
include a large number of regional and local companies located in major cities
throughout the United States and Canada. While the majority of the Company's
competitors operate in a limited geographic area, the operating divisions of a
few large, diversified facility service companies compete with the Company on a
national basis.

SALES AND MARKETING

     The Company's sales and marketing efforts are conducted by its corporate,
division, region, branch and district offices. Sales, marketing, management and
operations personnel in each of these offices participate directly in selling
and servicing customers. The broad geographic scope of these offices enables the
Company to provide a full range of facility services through intercompany sales
referrals, multi-service "bundled" sales and national account sales. The Company
also has designated a nationwide group of "ABM Family of Services" executives to
market all of the Company's facility services capabilities.

     The Company has a broad customer base including airports, apartment
complexes, city centers, colleges and universities, financial institutions,
industrial plants, office buildings, retail stores, shopping centers and theme
parks. No customer accounted for more than 5% of its revenues during the fiscal
year ended October 31, 2000.

EMPLOYEES

     The Company employs over 60,000 persons, of whom the vast majority are
service employees who perform air conditioning, elevator, engineering,
janitorial, lighting, parking and security services. Approximately 24,800 of
these employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements. There are
about 3,600 employees with executive, managerial, supervisory, administrative,
professional, sales, marketing or clerical responsibilities or other office
assignments.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The discussion of the Company's environmental matters can be found in Item
7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations."

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In fiscal 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No.
133") (as amended by SFAS Nos. 137 and 138). SFAS No. 133 is required to be
adopted for all fiscal quarters and fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000,
and relates to accounting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and hedging activities. It
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value. The adoption on SFAS
No. 133 is not anticipated to have a material effect on its results of
operations or its financial position.

     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements." SAB 101, as amended, is to be adopted for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1999, which for the Company would be fiscal year 2001. SAB
101 addresses various topics in revenue recognition. The Company is currently
analyzing SAB 101; however, based on management's current understanding and
interpretation, SAB 101 is not anticipated to have a material effect on its
results of operations or its financial position.

     In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Interpretation No. 44 ("FIN 44"), "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving
Stock Compensation -- An Interpretation of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
("APB") No. 25". FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB No. 25 and is effective
July 1, 2000. The Company believes that its current accounting policies are in
conformity with this interpretation.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto contained
in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule." All
information in the discussion and references to the years are based on the
Company's fiscal year that ends on October 31.

     Funds provided from operations and bank borrowings have historically been
the sources for meeting working capital requirements, financing capital
expenditures, acquisitions and paying cash dividends. Management believes that
funds from these sources will remain available and adequately serve the
Company's liquidity needs. The Company has an unsecured revolving credit
agreement with a syndicate of U.S. banks that provides a $150 million line of
credit expiring July 1, 2002. At the Company's option, the credit facility
provides interest at the prime rate or IBOR+.35%. As of October 31, 2000, the
total amount outstanding was approximately $106 million, which was comprised of
loans in the amount of $35 million and standby letters of credit of $71 million.
This agreement requires the Company to meet certain financial ratios, places
some limitations on outside borrowing and prohibits declaring or paying cash
dividends exceeding 50% of the Company's net income for any fiscal year. In
addition, the Company has a loan agreement with a major U.S. bank with a balance
of $2.6 million at October 31, 2000. This loan bears interest at a fixed rate of
6.78% with annual payments of principal, in varying amounts, and interest due
each February 15 through 2003. The Company's effective interest rate for all
long-term debt bank borrowings for the year ended October 31, 2000 was 7.4%.

     Operating activities generated cash flows in 1998, 1999 and 2000 of $32.1
million, $35.3 million and $18.9 million, respectively. The decrease in 2000
resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable, reflecting the
higher volume in sales and slower payments by some large customers. Cash paid
for acquisitions during the fiscal years ended October 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000,
including payments pursuant to contractual arrangements involved in prior
acquisitions, were approximately $10.0 million, $11.0 million and $14.2 million,
respectively. Capital expenditures during fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000 were
$11.7 million, $19.5 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Cash dividends
paid to stockholders of common and redeemable preferred stock and amounts used
to repurchase common stock were approximately $10.7 million in 1998, $18.5
million in 1999, and $22.9 million in 2000. Cash used in financing activities
during 1998 and 1999 was $11.3 million and $3.6 million, respectively. In 2000,
$12.3 million was provided by financing activities. The increase in 2000 was
primarily due to greater net borrowings and an increase in the bank overdraft
(outstanding checks). At October 31, 1999, working

                                        9
<PAGE>   10

capital was $184.3 million as compared to $224.2 million at October 31, 2000.

EFFECT OF INFLATION

     The low rates of inflation experienced in recent years have had no material
impact on the financial statements of the Company. The Company attempts to
recover increased costs by increasing sales prices to the extent permitted by
contracts and competition.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     The nature of the Company's operations, primarily services, would not
ordinarily involve it in environmental contamination. However, the Company's
operations are subject to various federal, state and/or local laws regulating
the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment, such as discharge into soil, water and air, and
the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and
hazardous substances. These laws generally have the effect of increasing costs
and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of the Company's
operations, although historically they have not had a material adverse effect on
the Company's financial position, cash flows or its results of operations.

     The Company is currently involved in three proceedings relating to
environmental matters: one involving alleged potential soil and groundwater
contamination at a Company facility in Florida; one involving alleged potential
soil contamination at a former Company facility in Arizona; and, one involving
alleged potential soil and groundwater contamination at a former dry-cleaning
facility leased by the Company in Nevada. While it is difficult to predict the
ultimate outcome of these matters, based on information currently available,
management believes that none of these matters, individually or in the
aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, cash flows, or its results of operations.

ACQUISITIONS

     The operating results of businesses acquired have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of
acquisition and are fully discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Acquisitions made during the three fiscal years ended October 31,
2000, contributed approximately $60 million to fiscal 2000 revenues.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF 2000 TO 1999

     The Company reported record revenues and earnings for 2000. Revenues and
other income (hereinafter called "revenues") were $1.8 billion in 2000, up $178
million or 11%, from $1.6 billion reported in 1999. The increase in revenues in
2000 over 1999 was attributable to new business and price increases as well as
acquisitions made during the prior years. Revenues generated from acquisitions
during the prior year contributed $17.1 million of the 2000 increase while the
current year acquisitions added $17.4 million.

     As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses and cost of goods sold was
87.1% for 2000, compared to 86.7% in 1999. Consequently, as a percentage of
revenues, the Company's gross profit (revenues minus operating expenses and cost
of goods sold) of 12.9% in 2000 was slightly lower than the gross profit of
13.3% in 1999. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was
mostly due to higher labor and related costs, particularly workers' compensation
insurance and continued competitive pressure to maintain or lower prices. In
addition, the Company's hourly workers were paid two additional workdays in 2000
compared to 1999. On fixed price monthly contracts, such increases are not
recovered.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses were $158 million in 2000, an
increase of 7.2% from $147 million in 1999. However, as a percentage of
revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 9.0% for
1999 to 8.7% for 2000, primarily due to certain costs that do not increase at
the same rate as sales. The absolute increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses was primarily due to salaries and expenses associated
with acquisitions including the amortization of goodwill, and costs associated
with the implementation of a new accounting system. The cost increases were
somewhat offset by decreased profit sharing expense.

     Interest expense was $3.3 million in 2000 compared to $2.0 million for
1999, an increase of $1.3 million. This increase was primarily due to higher
weighted average borrowings and interest rates in 2000.

     The income before income taxes (pre-tax income) for 2000 was $72.7 million
compared to
                                       10
<PAGE>   11

$67.2 million, an increase of 8% over 1999. Pre-tax income did not increase at
the same rate as revenues due to the higher operating expenses.

     The estimated effective income tax rate for 2000 was 39%, compared to 41%
in 1999. The lower tax rate was due for the most part to a significant increase
in the federal work opportunity tax credits.

     Net income for 2000 was $44.3 million, an increase of 12%, compared to net
income of $39.7 million in 1999. Diluted net income per common share also rose
12% to $1.85 for 2000 compared to $1.65 for the same period in 1999. On
September 22, 1999 the Company announced a stock repurchase program for up to
one million outstanding shares. As of October 31, 2000, 603,000 shares had been
reacquired. Earnings per share calculations also include the effect of a
preferred stock dividend deduction of $512,000 in both 2000 and 1999.

     The Company is organized into nine separate operating divisions as defined
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 131, "Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". However, only the ABM
Janitorial, Ampco System Parking, ABM Engineering, Amtech Lighting, and Amtech
Elevator Divisions are reportable using the criteria of SFAS No. 131. The
results of operations from these five reportable operating divisions for 2000 as
compared to 1999 are more fully described below:

     The ABM Janitorial Services Division reported revenues for 2000 of $1.1
billion, an increase of $120 million, or 13%, from 1999. This is the Company's
largest Division and accounted for 58% of the Company's consolidated revenues in
2000. ABM Janitorial Services revenues increased as a result of new business,
particularly in the Mid-Atlantic, Northwest and Southwest regions. Revenues
generated from acquisitions during the prior year contributed $11.8 million of
the 2000 increase while the current year acquisitions added $10.8 million. ABM
Janitorial Services' operating profits increased 9% in 2000 to $53.8 million
when compared to 1999. The lower percentage in profits can be attributed to low
profit margins and high startup costs on some large contracts in this Division's
Southeast region as well as the expense of extra workdays in fiscal 2000, as
discussed previously.

     Ampco System Parking increased revenues by 6% in 2000 from 1999 to $172.4
million, and its operating profits also increased 6% to $9.0 million during 2000
compared to 1999. The increase in revenues was mostly due to growth in
California and Texas, along with small acquisitions in Florida, Texas and
Washington.

     The ABM Engineering Services Division increased revenues by 2% in 2000 from
1999 to $156.3 million, while its operating profits decreased 2% to $8.2 million
for 2000 compared to 1999. The revenue increase was due primarily to additional
business obtained in New York City and Southern California. The decrease in
operating profits is due to lower profit margins and increased administrative
costs.

     Amtech Lighting Services reported a 24% revenue increase to $118.4 million
in 2000 from 1999 due to increased business in all its markets, except Northern
California, and an acquisition in the Southeast. In addition, a significant new
contract was obtained in New York City that began November 1, 1999. Operating
profits increased by 35% to $10.1 million during 2000 compared to the prior
year. Profit margins improved due to a reduction in labor and material costs.

     Revenues for Amtech Elevator Services were $114.4 million, up by 18% for
2000 over 1999, largely due to an increased customer base. The Amtech Elevator
Division reported a 3% increase to $6.8 million in operating profits in 2000
compared to 1999. The smaller increase in operating profits can be attributed
primarily to increased labor, material and insurance costs as well as
computer-related expenses.

COMPARISON OF 1999 TO 1998

     Revenues were $1.6 billion in 1999, up $128 million or 9%, from $1.5
billion reported in 1998. The increase in revenues in 1999 over 1998 was
attributable to new business and price increases as well as acquisitions made
during the prior years. Acquisitions during 1999 accounted for approximately $11
million, or approximately 9% of the total revenue increase of $128 million for
1999.

     As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses and cost of goods sold were
86.7% for 1999, compared to 86.5% in 1998. Consequently, the Company's gross
profit as a percentage of revenues of 13.3% in 1999 was slightly lower than the
gross profit of 13.5% in 1998. The gross profit percentage declined mostly due
to higher labor and related costs, particularly workers' compensation insurance,
and

                                       11
<PAGE>   12

continued competitive pressure to maintain or lower prices.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.2% for 1999
compared to 1998. However, as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased from 9.5% for 1998, to 9.0% for 1999,
primarily due to certain costs (such as health insurance and legal fees) that do
not increase at the same rate as sales. The dollar increase in selling, general
and administrative expenses is primarily due to salaries and expenses associated
with acquisitions including the amortization of goodwill.

     Interest expense was $2.0 million in 1999 compared to $3.5 million for
1998, a decrease of $1.5 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower
weighted average borrowings.

     The income before income taxes (pre-tax income) for 1999 was $67.2 million
compared to $57.5 million, an increase of 17% over 1998. The growth in pre-tax
income outpaced the revenue growth for 1999 primarily due to lower selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues.

     The estimated effective income tax rate for 1999 and 1998 was 41.0%.

     Net income for 1999 was $39.7 million, an increase of 17%, compared to net
income of $33.9 million in 1998. Diluted net income per common share rose 15% to
$1.65 for 1999 compared to $1.44 for the same period in 1998. The percentage
increase in diluted net income per share was less than the increase in net
income due to the 3% increase in number of diluted shares outstanding that
primarily resulted from stock purchased by employees under the Company's
Employee Stock Purchase Plan as well as stock options exercised. On September
22, 1999 the Company announced a stock repurchase program for up to one million
outstanding shares. As of October 31, 1999, 220,000 shares had been reacquired.
Earnings per share calculations also include the effect of a preferred stock
dividend deduction of $512,000 in both 1999 and 1998.

     The results of operations from the Company's five reportable operating
divisions for 1999 as compared to 1998 are more fully described below:

     Revenues of the ABM Janitorial Services Division increased by 9% during
1999 to $933.7 million over 1998, as a result of new business, particularly in
the Gulf Central, Mid-Atlantic and Southwest regions. Revenues generated from
acquisitions during 1998 contributed about $8.7 million of the 1999 increase
while the 1999 acquisitions added $9.1 million. Operating profits increased 11%
in 1999 to $49.5 million when compared to 1998. This profit increase was due
primarily to the increase in revenues, reduced legal fees and slightly lower
labor and labor related costs.

     Ampco System Parking's revenues increased by 5% to $162.4 million, while
its operating profits increased 22% to $8.5 million during 1999 compared to
1998. The increase in revenues was mostly due to growth in its California
region. The operating profit increase was due for the most part to the
conversion from leased lots to management contracts, which have higher margins,
as well as improved profits related to off-airport parking operations.

     The ABM Engineering Services Division increased revenues by 13% to $153.9
million and operating profits by 4% to $8.4 million for 1999 compared to 1998.
The large revenue increase was due primarily to new business in the Midwest,
Arizona, and Southern California regions. The smaller percentage increase in
operating profits is due to lower margins on contracts particularly in the New
York and Philadelphia regions and pressure from competition to reduce fees.

     Amtech Lighting Services reported a 9% revenue increase to $95.8 million
due to increased business in the Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleans, New York, and
Oakland markets. Operating profits increased by 8% to $7.5 million during 1999
compared to the prior year primarily due to the increased sales.

     Revenues for Amtech Elevator Services were $96.6 million, up by 8% for 1999
over 1998, largely due to an increased customer base in the maintenance and
repair sector. The Amtech Elevator Division reported a 3% increase in operating
profits in 1999 to $6.7 million compared to 1998. The smaller increase in
operating profits can be attributed primarily to the inability of the Division
to pass on increased labor and insurance costs.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

     Cautionary Safe Harbor Disclosure for Forward Looking Statements under the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Because of the factors set
forth below, as well as other variables affecting the Company's operating
results, past financial performance, should not be considered a reliable

                                       12

indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The statements contained
herein which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that are
subject to meaningful risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: (1)
significant decreases in commercial real estate occupancy, resulting in reduced
demand and prices for building maintenance and other facility services in the
Company's major markets, (2) loss or bankruptcy of one or more of the Company's
major customers, which could adversely affect the Company's ability to collect
its accounts receivable or recover its deferred costs, (3) major collective
bargaining issues that may cause loss of revenues or cost increases that
non-union companies can use to their advantage in gaining market share, (4)
significant shortfalls in adding additional customers in existing and new
territories and markets, (5) a protracted slowdown in the Company's acquisition
program, (6) legislation or other governmental action that severely impacts one
or more of the Company's lines of business, such as price controls that could
restrict price increases, or the unrecovered cost of any universal employer-paid
health insurance, as well as government investigations that adversely affect the
Company, (7) reduction or revocation of the Company's line of credit, which
would increase interest expense or the cost of capital, (8) cancellation or
nonrenewal of the Company's primary insurance policies, as many customers
contract out services based on the contractor's ability to provide adequate
insurance coverage and limits, (9) catastrophic uninsured or underinsured claims
against the Company, the inability of the Company's insurance carriers to pay
otherwise insured claims, or inadequacy in the Company's reserve for
self-insured claims, (10) inability to employ entry level personnel due to labor
shortages, (11) resignation, termination, death or disability of one or more of
the Company's key executives, which could adversely affect customer retention
and day-to-day management of the Company, and (12) other material factors that
are disclosed from time to time in the Company's public filings with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission, such as reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K
and 10-Q.

ITEM 7A.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company does not issue or invest in financial instruments or their
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The operations of the Company
are conducted primarily in the United States, and, as such, are not subject to
material foreign currency exchange rate risk. Although the Company has
outstanding debt and related interest expense, market risk in interest rate
exposure in the United States is currently not material.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
ABM Industries Incorporated:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ABM
Industries Incorporated and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1999 and 2000, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended October 31, 2000. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement
schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and the financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ABM
Industries Incorporated and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1999 and 2000, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended October 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule II, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

ABM Industries Incorporated and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of ABM Industries Incorporated and its subsidiaries ("the
Company"). All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated.

     USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and related notes to financial statements. Changes in such
estimates may affect amounts reported in future periods.

     ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE: The Company's accounts receivable are principally
trade receivables arising from services provided to its customers and are
generally due and payable on terms varying from the receipt of invoice to net
thirty days. The Company does not believe that it has any material exposure due
to either industry or regional concentrations of credit risk.

     INVENTORIES: Inventories are valued at amounts approximating the lower of
cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. At the time property, plant
and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is
reflected in income. Maintenance and repairs are charged against income.

     Depreciation and amortization are calculated principally on the
straight-line method. Lives used in computing depreciation for transportation
equipment average 3 to 5 years and 2 to 20 years for machinery and other
equipment. Buildings are depreciated over periods of 20 to 40 years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the terms of the respective
leases, or the assets' useful lives.

     The Company is implementing an enterprise-wide information system. External
direct costs of materials and services and payroll-related costs of employees
working solely on the development of the system are capitalized. In addition, in
1999 and 2000 related interest costs of approximately $135,000 and $182,000,
respectively, were capitalized. Capitalized costs of the project will be
amortized over a period of five years beginning when the system is placed in
service. Training costs are expensed as incurred.

     INTANGIBLE ASSETS: Intangible assets consist of goodwill in the amount of
$168,110,000 and other intangible assets in the amount of $2,530,000, net of
accumulated amortization of $60,543,000. Goodwill, which represents the excess
of cost over fair value of tangible assets of businesses acquired, is amortized
on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding 40 years. It is the
Company's policy to carry goodwill applicable to acquisitions prior to 1971 of
$1,450,000 at cost until such time as there may be evidence of diminution in
value.

     IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: The Company annually reviews its
long-lived assets, including goodwill. Impairment is evaluated on the basis of
whether the asset is fully recoverable from projected, undiscounted net cash
flows of the related business unit, in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121. Impairment is recognized in operating results when
a permanent diminution in value is believed to have occurred. The Company
measures impairment as the excess of any unamortized goodwill over the estimated
future discounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset.

     INCOME TAXES: Income tax expense is based on reported results of operations
before income taxes. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", deferred income taxes reflect
the impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities
recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax
purposes. These deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION: Revenues are recorded at the time services are
performed or when title transfers for products shipped.

     NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The company has reported its earnings in
accordance with State-

                                       18
<PAGE>   19

ment of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share". Basic net
income per common share, after the reduction for preferred stock dividends, is
based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per common share, after the reduction for preferred stock
dividends, is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the period, including common stock equivalents. The calculation of these amounts
is as follows:

     For the purposes of computing diluted net income per common share, weighted
average common share equivalents do not include stock options with an exercise
price that exceeds the average fair market value of the Company's common stock
for the period. On October 31, 2000, options to purchase approximately 1,078,000
shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $31.71 were
outstanding, but were excluded from the computation because the options'
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares.
At October 31, 1999, 1,268,000 shares of common stock at a weighted average
exercise price of $31.09 were outstanding, but were excluded from the
computation because the options' exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the common shares.

     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid
instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash
equivalents.

     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company accounts for its stock-based awards
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees".

     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Comprehensive income consists of net income and other
related gains and losses affecting shareholder's equity that, under generally
accepted accounting principles, are excluded from net income. For the Company,
such comprehensive income items consist of unrealized foreign currency
translation gains and losses, the tax effect of such was insignificant.

2. INSURANCE

     Certain insurable risks such as general liability, property damage and
workers' compensation are self-insured by the Company. However, the Company has
umbrella insurance coverage for certain risk exposures subject to specified
limits. Accruals for claims under the Company's self-insurance program are
recorded on a claim-incurred basis. Under this program, the estimated liability
for claims incurred but unpaid at October 31, 1999 and 2000 was $83,665,000 and
$90,820,000, respectively. In connection with certain self-insurance agreements,
the Company has standby letters of credit at October 31, 2000 supporting the
estimated unpaid liability in the amounts of $69,381,000.

5. LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENT

     The Company has a $150 million syndicated line of credit expiring July 1,
2002. The unsecured revolving credit facility provides, at the Company's

                                       19
<PAGE>   20

option, interest at the prime rate or IBOR+.35%. The facility calls for a
commitment fee payable quarterly, in arrears, of .12% based on the average,
daily, unused portion. For purposes of this calculation, irrevocable standby
letters of credit issued in conjunction with the Company's self-insurance
program plus cash borrowings are considered to be outstanding amounts. As of
October 31, 2000, the total outstanding amount under this facility was
$106,000,000, comprised of $35,000,000 in loans and $71,000,000 in standby
letters of credit. The interest rates at October 31, 2000, on loans outstanding
under this agreement ranged from 7.1% to 9.5%. The Company is required, under
this agreement to maintain financial ratios and places certain limitations on
dividend payments. The Company is prohibited from paying cash dividends
exceeding 50% of its net income for any fiscal year.

     The Company has a loan agreement with a major U.S. bank with a balance of
$2,622,000, at October 31, 2000. This loan bears interest at a fixed rate of
6.78% with annual payments of principal, in varying amounts, and interest due
each February 15 through 2003.

     The long-term debt of $37,676,000 matures in the years ending October 31 as
follows: $865,000 in 2001, $35,869,000 in 2002, and $942,000 in 2003.

     Long-term debt at October 31, is summarized as follows:

6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
(a) RETIREMENT AGREEMENTS
     The Company has unfunded retirement agreements for approximately 47 current
and former directors and senior executives, many of which are fully vested. The
agreements provide for annual benefits for ten years commencing at the later of
the respective retirement dates of those executives or age 65. The benefits are
accrued over the period these directors and senior executives are expected to be
employed by the Company. During 1998, 1999 and 2000, amounts accrued under these
agreements were $513,000, $674,000 and $684,000, respectively. Payments were
made in 1998, 1999 and 2000 in the amounts of $207,000, $231,000 and $171,000,
respectively.

(b) 401(k) AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN

     The Company has a profit sharing and 401(k) plan covering certain qualified
employees, which includes employer participation in accordance with the
provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan allows
participants to make pretax contributions and the Company matches certain
percentages of employee contributions depending on the participant's length of
service. The profit sharing portion of the plan is discretionary and
noncontributory. All amounts contributed to the plan are deposited into a trust
fund administered by independent trustees.

     The Company provided for profit sharing contributions of $1,534,000 and
$1,643,000 for 1998 and 1999, respectively. No contribution was provided for
fiscal year 2000. The Company's matching 401(k) contributions required by the
401(k) plan for 1998, 1999 and 2000 were approximately $1,066,000, $1,210,000
and $1,191,000, respectively.

(c) SERVICE AWARD BENEFIT PLAN

     In 1989, the Company adopted an unfunded service award benefit plan, with a
retroactive vesting period of five years. This plan is a "severance pay plan" as
defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and covers
certain qualified employees. The plan provides participants, upon termination,
with a guaranteed seven days pay for each year of employment subsequent to
November 1, 1989. The Company, at its discretion, may also award additional days
each year.

     Net cost of the plan is comprised of:

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named defendants in
certain litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management, based on advice of legal counsel, such matters should have no
material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

9. REDEEMABLE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK

     On June 23, 1993, the Company authorized 6,400 shares of preferred stock
having a par value of $0.01 per share. These shares designated as Series B 8%
Senior Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) shall be
entitled to one vote per share on all matters upon which common stockholders are
entitled to vote and have a redemption price of $1,000 per share, together with
accrued and unpaid dividends thereon. Redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock
is at the option of the holders for any or all of the outstanding shares after
September 1, 1998 or at the option of the Company after September 1, 2002. The
total redemption value of the shares outstanding at October 31, 1999 and 2000 in
an amount of $6,400,000 is classified on the Company's balance sheet as
redeemable cumulative preferred stock. In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, holders of the Series B
Preferred Stock shall be paid the redemption price plus all accrued dividends to
the date of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of affairs before any payment
to other stockholders.

     On September 1, 1993, the Company issued 6,400 shares of its Series B
Preferred Stock in conjunction with the acquisition of System Parking. The
acquisition agreement provided that one-half, or 3,200 shares, of the Series B
Preferred Stock be placed in escrow and will be released upon certain earnout
requirements. As of October 31, 2000, none of these shares have been released.

     Dividends of $128,000 are due and payable each quarter and are deducted
from net income in determining net income per common share.

10. CAPITAL STOCK

     In March 1999, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common

                                       21
<PAGE>   22

stock, par value $.01 per share, authorized for issue from 28,000,000 to
100,000,000.

     The Company is also authorized to issue 500,000 shares of preferred stock,
of which 50,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock of $.01 par value. None of these preferred shares have been
issued.

     In March 1998, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a stockholder
rights plan to replace an existing rights plan that expired on April 22, 1998.
The new plan provides for a dividend distribution of one preferred stock
purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock,
distributed to stockholders of record on April 22, 1998. The Rights will be
exercisable only if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company's
common stock (an "Acquiring Person") or announces a tender offer for 20% or more
of the common stock. Each Right will entitle stockholders to buy one-thousandth
of a share of newly created Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Company at an initial exercise price of $175 per Right, subject to
adjustment from time to time. However, if any person becomes an Acquiring
Person, each Right will then entitle its holder (other than the Acquiring
Person) to purchase at the exercise price common stock (or, in certain
circumstances, Participating Preferred Stock) of the Company having a market
value at that time of twice the Right's exercise price. These Rightsholders
would also be entitled to purchase an equivalent number of shares at the
exercise price if the Acquiring Person were to control the Company's Board of
Directors and cause the Company to enter into certain mergers or other
transactions. In addition, if an Acquiring Person acquired between 20% and 50%
of the Company's voting stock, the Company's Board of Directors may, at its
option, exchange one share of the Company's common stock for each Right held
(other than Rights held by the Acquiring Person). Rights held by the Acquiring
Person will become void. The Rights Plan excludes from its operation The
Theodore Rosenberg Trust and The Sydney J. Rosenberg Trust, and certain related
persons, and, as a result, their holdings will not cause the Rights to become
exercisable or nonredeemable or trigger the other features of the Rights. The
Rights will expire on April 22, 2008, unless earlier redeemed by the Board at
$0.01 per Right.

     As discussed in Note 1, the Company continues to account for its
stock-based awards using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees", and its related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized in the financial statements for employee stock
awards.

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation", requires the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and
earnings per share had the Company adopted the fair value method as of the
beginning of fiscal 1996. Under SFAS 123, the fair value of stock-based awards
to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models. The use of
these models requires subjective assumptions, including future stock price
volatility and expected time to exercise, which can have a significant effect on
the calculated values. The Company's calculations were made using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: expected life 11.4 years, 11.9 years, and 9.1 years from the date
of grant in fiscal 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively; expected stock price
volatility of 25.3%, 26.2% and 27.7%, respectively; expected dividend yields of
1.5%, 1.9% and 3.1%, and risk free interest rates of 6.0%, 5.0%, and 6.7% in
fiscal 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively.

     The Company's calculations are based on a single option valuation approach
and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. If the computed fair values of the
fiscal awards had been amortized to expense over the vesting period of the
awards, pro forma net earnings would have been $27,496,000 ($1.17 per diluted
share) for fiscal 1998, $35,409,000 ($1.47 per diluted share) for fiscal 1999,
and $39,477,000 ($1.64 per diluted share) for fiscal 2000. The impact of
outstanding stock options granted prior to fiscal 1996 has been excluded from
the pro forma calculation; accordingly, the fiscal 1998, 1999, and 2000 pro
forma adjustments are not indicative of future period pro forma adjustments,
when the calculation will apply to all future applicable stock grants.

     Under the "Price-Vested" Performance Stock Option Plan options were granted
with a ten-year term. If, during the first four years, the stock price achieved
and maintained a set price for ten out of thirty consecutive trading days, the
options associated with the price would vest. The prices established were $25,
$30, $35 and $40, with 25% of the options vesting at each price point. If, at
the end of four years, any of the stock price performance targets

                                       22
<PAGE>   23

were not achieved, then the remaining options would vest at the end of eight
years from the date the options were granted. SFAS 123 requires that the
projected value of the options be determined on the grant date and recognized
over the period in which the options are earned (the vesting period). For these
options, the projected value of the options was determined and that value was to
be recognized over the eight-year vesting period unless vesting occurred at an
earlier date. In fiscal 1998 ABM stock achieved and maintained for the requisite
ten-day period, the first three price targets. As a result, 75% of the fiscal
1997 options vested, and the projected value of that 75% was recognized in 1998
pro forma net income. Of the remaining 25% of the fiscal 1997 options, one-
eighth was recognized in each of the last four years, and the remaining amount
will be recognized over the next four years. During fiscal 1998 and 2000, the
first two price targets were met for the fiscal 1998 and 2000 grants,
respectively. One-eighth of the remaining 50% of the respective grants has been
recognized for each applicable fiscal year.

     "Time-Vested" Incentive Stock Option Plan, as amended

     In 1987, the Company adopted a stock option plan under which 1,200,000

     "Price-Vested" Performance Stock Option Plan

     In December 1996, the Company adopted a stock option plan under which
1,500,000 shares have been reserved. The options expire 10 years after the date
of grant and any options which terminate without being exercised may be
reissued. Each option will have a pre-defined vesting price which provides for
accelerated vesting if the fair market value of the Company's common stock is
equal to or greater than the pre-defined vesting price for 10 trading days in
any period of 30 consecutive trading days. Vested options will become
exercisable only after the first anniversary of its grant date. Any option that
has not vested prior to the fourth anniversary of its grant date will vest on
the eighth anniversary of its grant date. At October 31, 2000, 194,000 shares
remained available for grant.

     Transactions under this plan are summarized as follows:

     "Age-Vested" Career Stock Option Plan, as amended

     In 1984, the Company adopted a stock option plan whereby 680,000 shares
were reserved for grant. In March 1996, another 1,000,000 shares were reserved
for grant under the plan. As amended December 20, 1994, options which have been
granted at fair market value are 50% exercisable when the option holders reach
their 61st birthday and the remaining 50% will vest on their 64th birthday. To
the extent vested, the options may be exercised at any time prior to one year
after termination of employment. Options which terminate without being exercised
may be reissued. At October 31, 2000, 443,000 shares remained available for
grant.

     Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended

     In 1985, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan under which
sale of 5 million shares of its common stock has been authorized. In March 1996,
the sale of an additional 1,200,000 shares were authorized, and again in March
of 1999, 1,200,000 additional shares were authorized under this plan. The
purchase price of the shares under the plan is the lesser of 85% of the fair
market value at the commencement of each plan year or 85% of the fair market
value on the date of purchase. Employees may designate up to 10% of their
compensation for the purchase of stock. During 1998, 1999, and 2000, 562,000,
602,000, and 635,000 shares of stock were issued under the plan for an aggregate
purchase price of $10,873,000, $13,632,000 and $12,588,000, respectively. The
weighted average fair value per share of purchases in 1998, 1999, and 2000 was
$5.11, $7.32, and $7.27, respectively, and were issued at a weighted average
price of $19.34, $23.25 and $19.84, respectively. At October 31, 2000, 257,000
shares remained unissued under the plan.

net deferred tax asset will be realized.

     At October 31, 2000, ABM has a capital loss carryover of $1,057,085, which
can be carried forward to offset capital gains, if any, to reduce future federal
income taxes through October 31, 2002.

12. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

     All acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting; operations of the companies and businesses acquired have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from their
respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over fair
value of the net assets acquired is generally included in goodwill. Most
purchase agreements provide for contingent payments based on the annual pretax
income for subsequent periods ranging generally from three to five years. Any
such future payments are generally capitalized as goodwill when paid. Cash paid
for acquisitions, including any contingent amounts based on subsequent earnings,
were approximately $14 million in 2000. In addition, common shares, with a fair
market value of approximately $1.6 million at the date of issuance, were issued
in 2000 under the contingent payment provisions of a prior year acquisition. As
these acquisitions were not significant, pro forma information is not included
in these financial statements. Acquisitions and dispositions made during the
fiscal year 2000 are discussed below:

     Effective November 1, 1999, the Company acquired the operations and
selected assets of NPS Corporation, a janitorial services company, with
customers located in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau, Alaska. The terms included
a cash down payment made at closing plus annual contingent payments based on

13. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash
equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-maturity of these
instruments.

     Financial instruments included in investments and long-term receivables
have no quoted market prices and, accordingly, a reasonable estimate of fair
market value could not be made without incurring excessive costs. However, the
Company believes by reference to stated interest rates and security held, the
fair value of the assets would not differ significantly from the carrying value.

     The fair value of the Company's long-term debt approximates carrying value
based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the
current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities.

     The Company believes that it is not practical to estimate a fair market
value different from the redeemable cumulative preferred stock's carrying value
of $6.4 million, as this security was issued in conjunction with an acquisition
and has numerous features unique to this security as described in Note 9.
However, the Company believes the carrying value would not differ significantly
from the fair value.

14. SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Under Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131,
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" segment
information is presented under the management approach. The management approach
designates the internal organization that is used by management for making
operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's
reportable segments. SFAS 131 also requires disclosures about products and
services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company is organized into
nine separate operating segments as defined under SFAS 131. However the ABM
Janitorial, Amtech Elevator, ABM Engineering, Amtech Lighting and Ampco System
Parking operating segments are reportable using the quantitative threshold
criteria under SFAS 131. Included in other segments are the ABM Service Network,
American Commercial Security, CommAir Mechanical Services and Easterday
Janitorial Supply Company segments. In addition, the corporate expenses are not
allocated. All of these segments are distinct business units. They are managed
separately because of their unique services, technology and marketing
requirements. Nearly 100% of the operations and related revenues are within the
United States and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of sales.
