                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

       ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM") is the largest facility services
contractor listed on the New York Stock Exchange. With annual revenues exceeding
$1.9 billion and more than 60,000 employees, ABM and its subsidiaries (the
"Company") provide air conditioning, elevator, engineering, janitorial,
lighting, parking and security services to thousands of commercial, industrial
and institutional customers in hundreds of cities across North America.

       ABM was reincorporated in Delaware on March 19, 1985, as the successor to
a business founded in California in 1909. The Corporate Headquarters of the
Company are located at 160 Pacific Avenue, Suite 222, San Francisco, California
94111, and its telephone number is 415/733-4000.

INDUSTRY INFORMATION

       The Company's operations are grouped into eight divisions (comprised of
one or more subsidiaries of the Company), as they existed at October 31, 2001.
Referred to as "ABM Industries Incorporated Family of Services", they are listed
below by their respective division name:

                       -  ABM Engineering Services
                       -  ABM Janitorial Services
                       -  ABM Service Network
                       -  American Commercial Security Services
                       -  Ampco System Parking
                       -  Amtech Elevator Services
                       -  Amtech Lighting Services
                       -  CommAir Mechanical Services

       Additional information relating to the Company's industry segments
appears in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
Item 8, "Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule." The business
activities of the Company's industry segments, as they existed at October 31,
2001, are more fully described below.

       - ABM ENGINEERING SERVICES provides building owners and managers with
on-site engineers to operate, maintain and repair electrical, energy management,
mechanical, and plumbing systems utilizing computerized maintenance management
systems ("CMMS"). This service is primarily for high-rise office buildings, but
customers also include schools, warehouses, factories, shopping malls and
universities. ABM Engineering Services operates in 21 states through ten
regional offices, three of which are in California and one each in Arizona,
Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York and Texas. In 1999, this
Division earned ISO 9002 Certification, the first national engineering services
provider of on-site operating engineers to earn this exclusive designation. ISO
is a quality standard comprised of a rigorous set of guidelines and good
business practices against which companies are rated through a comprehensive
independent audit process that can take several years.

       - ABM JANITORIAL SERVICES (also known as "American Building Maintenance")
provides a wide range of basic janitorial services for a variety of structures
and organizations, including office buildings, industrial plants, banks,
department stores, theaters, warehouses, educational and health institutions and
airport terminals. Services provided include floor cleaning and finishing, wall
and window washing, furniture polishing, rug cleaning, dusting, as well as other
building cleaning services. ABM Janitorial Services maintains 99 offices in 35
states, the District of Columbia and one Canadian province, and operates under
thousands of individually negotiated building maintenance contracts, the
majority of which are obtained by competitive bidding. Generally, profit margins
on maintenance contracts tend to be inversely proportional to the size of the
contract. Although many of this Division's maintenance contracts are fixed-price
agreements, others contain clauses under which the customer agrees to reimburse
the full amount of wages, payroll taxes, insurance charges and other expenses
plus a profit percentage. The majority of ABM Janitorial Services contracts are
for one-year periods, contain automatic renewal clauses and are subject to
termination by either party by a 30 to 90 day written notice.


                                       3
<PAGE>

       - ABM SERVICE NETWORK (also known as "ABM Facility Services") provides
customers with streamlined, centralized control and coordination of multiple
facility service needs. This process is consistent with the greater competitive
demands on corporate organizations to become more efficient in the business
market today. By leveraging the core competencies of the Company's other
divisions, this Division attempts to reduce overhead, such as redundant
personnel, for its customers by providing multiple services under a single
contract, with one contact and one invoice. Its National Service Center provides
centralized dispatching, emergency services, accounting and related reports to
financial institutions, high-tech companies, and other customers regardless of
industry or size. ABM Service Network is headquartered in San Francisco, where
it also maintains its National Service Center.

       - AMERICAN COMMERCIAL SECURITY SERVICES (also known as "ACSS" and "ABM
Security Services") provides security guards, electric monitoring of fire, life,
safety, and access control devices, and security consulting services to a wide
range of businesses in the major metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Arizona; San
Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; New
Orleans, Louisiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Portland, Oregon; Houston, Dallas,
Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, Texas; Seattle, Washington; and Salt Lake
City, Utah. Much like ABM Janitorial Services, the majority of this Division's
contracts are for one-year periods, contain automatic renewal clauses and are
subject to termination by either party by a 30 to 90 day written notice.

       - AMPCO SYSTEM PARKING (also known as "Ampco System Airport Parking" and
"Ampco Express Airport Parking") operates approximately 1,600 parking lots and
garages, which are either leased from or operated through management contracts
for third parties. The lease terms generally range from 5 to 20 years and
usually contain provisions for renewal options. Leases which expire may continue
on a month-to-month basis or may be replaced by similar leases. Many leases
contain provisions for contingent rentals based on revenues. Ampco System
Parking currently operates in 26 states and the following airports: Austin,
Texas; Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Honolulu, Hawaii; and San Francisco,
California, to name a few. In conjunction with its on-airport parking services,
this Division also operates off-airport parking facilities in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania; Houston, Texas; Los Angeles and San Diego, California, and parking
shuttle bus services at thirteen locations.

       - AMTECH ELEVATOR SERVICES maintains, modernizes and repairs elevators
and escalators in major metropolitan areas of California; Houston, Texas;
Cincinnati, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; Las Vegas,
Nevada; Pennsauken, New Jersey; Atlanta, Georgia; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;
Phoenix, Arizona; Denver, Colorado; Chicago, Illinois; and Washington, D.C.
Amtech Elevator Services maintains 18 offices and several parts warehouses, and
operates a fleet of radio-equipped service vehicles.

       - AMTECH LIGHTING SERVICES provides relamping, fixture cleaning, and
periodic lighting maintenance service to a variety of commercial, retail, and
industrial customers. Amtech Lighting Services also maintains electrical outdoor
signage and provides electrical service and repairs for their customer base.
This Division maintains 28 offices, eight of which are located in California,
four are in Texas, two in North Carolina; and one office in each of the
following states: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana,
Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, and
Washington.

       - COMMAIR MECHANICAL SERVICES (also known as "CommAir Preferred
Mechanical Services") installs, maintains, and repairs heating, ventilation and
air conditioning equipment, performs chemical water treatment, and provides
energy conservation services for commercial, industrial and institutional
facilities. CommAir Mechanical Services maintains nine offices, eight of which
are located in California, and one in Phoenix, Arizona.

       Effective April 30, 2001, the Company sold its Easterday Janitorial
Supply Division, which in fiscal 2000 had annual revenues of $43.9 million, of
which 27% were intercompany sales. Additional information regarding this
transaction appears in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule."

       The effect on revenues and operations of the September 11 terrorist
attacks is described in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."


                                       4

TRADEMARKS

       The Company believes that it owns or is licensed to use all corporate
names, trade names, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents and trade
secrets which are material to the Company's operations.

COMPETITION

       The Company believes that each aspect of its business is highly
competitive, and that such competition is based primarily on price and quality
of service. Nearly all services provided by the Company are under contracts
originally obtained through competitive bidding. The Company's competitors
include a large number of regional and local companies located in major cities
throughout the United States and Canada. While the majority of the Company's
competitors operate in a limited geographic area, the operating divisions of a
few large, diversified facility service companies compete with the Company on a
national basis.

SALES AND MARKETING

       The Company's sales and marketing efforts are conducted by its corporate,
division, region, branch and district offices. Sales, marketing, management and
operations personnel in each of these offices participate directly in selling
and servicing customers. The broad geographic scope of these offices enables the
Company to provide a full range of facility services through intercompany sales
referrals, multi-service "bundled" sales and national account sales. The Company
also has designated a nationwide group of "ABM Family of Services" executives to
market all of the Company's facility services capabilities.

       The Company has a broad customer base including airports, apartment
complexes, city centers, colleges and universities, financial institutions,
industrial plants, office buildings, retail stores, shopping centers and theme
parks. No customer accounted for more than 5% of its revenues during the fiscal
year ended October 31, 2001.

EMPLOYEES

       The Company employs over 60,000 persons, of whom the vast majority are
service employees who perform air conditioning, elevator, engineering,
janitorial, lighting, parking and security services. Approximately 24,900 of
these employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements. There are
about 3,600 employees with executive, managerial, supervisory, administrative,
professional, sales, marketing or clerical responsibilities or other office
assignments.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

       The nature of the Company's operations, primarily services, would not
ordinarily involve it in environmental contamination. However, the Company's
operations are subject to various federal, state and/or local laws regulating
the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment, such as discharge into soil, water and air, and
the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and
hazardous substances. These laws generally have the effect of increasing costs
and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of the Company's
operations, although historically they have not had a material adverse effect on
the Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

       The Company is currently involved in three proceedings relating to
environmental matters: one involving alleged potential soil and groundwater
contamination at a Company facility in Florida; one involving alleged potential
soil contamination at a former Company facility in Arizona; and one involving
alleged potential soil and groundwater contamination at a former dry-cleaning
facility leased by the Company in Nevada. While it is difficult to predict the
ultimate outcome of these matters, based on information currently available,
management believes that none of these matters, individually or in the
aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. As any
liability related to these claims is neither probable nor estimable, no accruals
have been made related to these matters.

       Stockholders' equity per common share is calculated by dividing
stockholders' equity at the end of the fiscal year by the number of shares of
common stock outstanding at that date. The Company believes that stockholders'
equity per common share is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used
by analysts, investors and other interested persons. However, stockholders'
equity per common share as presented in this report may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

FINANCIAL CONDITION

       The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto contained
in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedule." All
information in the discussion and references to the years are based on the
Company's fiscal year that ends on October 31.

       Funds provided from operations and bank borrowings have historically been
the sources for meeting working capital requirements, financing capital
expenditures and acquisitions, and paying cash dividends. Management believes
that funds from these sources will remain available and adequately serve the
Company's liquidity needs. The Company has an unsecured revolving credit
agreement with a syndicate of U.S. banks that provides a $150 million line of
credit expiring July 1, 2002. At the Company's option, the credit facility
provides interest at the prime rate or IBOR+.35%. As of October 31, 2001 the
total amount outstanding was approximately $52 million, which was comprised of
loans in the amount of $10 million and standby letters of credit of $42 million.
This agreement requires the Company to meet certain financial ratios and places
some limitations on outside borrowing. In addition, the Company has a loan
agreement with a major U.S. bank with a balance of $1.8 million at October 31,
2001. This loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.78% with annual payments of
principal, in varying amounts, and interest due each February 15 through 2003.

       On September 4, 2001, the Company redeemed 6,400 shares of Series B 8%
Senior Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock having a par value of $0.01 per
share and redemption price of $1,000 per share.

       Operating activities generated cash flows in 2001, 2000 and 1999 of $65.8
million, $18.9 million and $35.3 million, respectively. While each year's cash
flows were impacted by higher volume in revenues, the 2000 decrease reflected
slower payments by some large customers. Cash paid for acquisitions during the
fiscal years ended October 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, including payments pursuant
to contractual arrangements involved in prior acquisitions, were approximately
$23.4 million, $14.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively. Capital
expenditures during fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $16.9 million, $18.7
million and $19.5 million, respectively. Cash dividends paid to stockholders of
common and redeemable preferred stock and amounts used to repurchase common
stock were approximately $16.2 million in 2001, $22.9 million in 2000, and $18.5
million in 1999. Cash from financing activities changed in 2001 compared to 2000
primarily due to repayments of nearly $26 million in debt and a reduction in the
bank overdraft (outstanding checks) of nearly $16 million .

       At October 31, 2001, working capital was $229.5 million as compared to
$224.2 million at October 31, 2000. The largest component of working capital
consists of trade accounts receivable that totaled $367 million at October 31,
2001 compared to $353 million at October 31, 2000. These amounts were net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts of $9.4 million and $8.8 million at October 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. As of October 31, 2001, accounts receivable that
were over 90 days past due had increased $6.6 million to $55.9 million (15% of
the total outstanding) from $49.3 million (14% of the total outstanding) at
October 31, 2000.

       The Company self-insures, generally up to $500,000 per occurrence,
certain insurable risks such as general liability, property damage and workers'
compensation. Commercial umbrella policies are obtained to provide for $125
million of coverage above the self-insured retention limits. It is the Company's
policy to annually retain an outside actuary to review the adequacy of its
self-insurance claim reserves.

       The energy crisis in the State of California has not had a material
impact on the Company.

IMPACT OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS

       As previously reported by the Company, the World Trade Center in New York
was the Company's largest single job site with annual revenues of approximately
$65 million (3% of ABM's consolidated revenues). Nearly 800 operating engineers,
janitorial workers and lighting technicians from three divisions of the Company
worked various shifts throughout the day and night. There has been no further
information regarding the fate of seventeen employees still missing and now
presumed dead. The Company estimates that annual gross profits


                                       9
<PAGE>

on this business approached $10 million. Additionally, the Company provided
approximately $60 million in annual services to neighboring job sites which had
various major disruptions.

       The Company has commercial insurance policies covering business
interruption, property damage and other losses related to this tragic incident
and has been working with its carrier, Zurich Insurance, in providing
preliminary claim information regarding the property damage and lost business
income. Zurich has neither accepted nor denied coverage for all or any part of
the claim as of the date of this filing. However, Zurich filed for a Declaratory
Judgement Action in the Southern District of New York claiming the loss of the
business profit falls under a Contingent Business Interruption Sub-limit within
the policy of $10 million. Based on review of the policy and consultation with
coverage counsel and other claim experts, the Company believes that its business
interruption claim does not fall under the $10 million sub-limit on contingent
business interruption. Zurich's filing does not impact any other aspects of the
claim.

       Under the guidance published by the Emerging Issues Task Force of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board "Accounting for the Impact of the Terrorist
Attacks of September 11, 2001", the Company has not recognized the amounts it
expects to recover from its business interruption insurance as income. Any gain
from insurance proceeds is considered a contingent gain and, under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," can only
be recognized as income in the period when any and all contingencies relating to
the insurance claim have been resolved. The Company has recognized income from
insurance policies to the extent of costs incurred for property damage and
direct expenditures related to the attacks.

       In response to these announced developments, on September 16, 2001, the
Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million
shares of its outstanding stock at any time through December 31, 2001. On
December 17, 2001, the Board of Directors extended this authorization to
repurchase until December 31, 2002. As of the filing date of this report, there
has been no repurchase by the Company of its outstanding shares.

EFFECT OF INFLATION

       The low rates of inflation experienced in recent years have had no
material impact on the financial statements of the Company. The Company attempts
to recover increased costs by increasing sales prices to the extent permitted by
contracts and competition.

ACQUISITIONS

       The operating results of businesses acquired have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of
acquisition and are more fully discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Acquisitions made during the three fiscal years ended
October 31, 2001, contributed approximately $119.2 million to fiscal 2001
revenues.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF 2001 TO 2000

       The Company reported record revenues for 2001. Revenues and other income
(hereinafter called "revenues") were over $1.9 billion in 2001, up $142 million
or 8%, from $1.8 billion reported in 2000. The increase in revenues in 2001 over
2000 was attributable to new business and acquisitions made during the prior
years. Revenues generated from acquisitions during the prior year contributed
$9.4 million of the 2001 increase while the current year acquisitions added
$65.7 million. Although the Company achieved record annual revenues, net income
fell by 26% to $32.8 million ($1.30 per diluted share) in 2001 from $44.3
million ($1.85 per diluted share) in 2000 primarily due to a $20 million pre-tax
charge to strengthen the Company's self-insurance reserves reflecting the
results of the annual independent actuarial review completed in December. The
actuarial report this year revealed that while the frequency of claims is
trending favorably as expected, the severity of claims in 2000 and 2001 trended
higher than anticipated in the report received last year. The impact of these
trends on known claims and Claims Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) called for an
increase of approximately $8.5 million for fiscal 2001 claims while
approximately $10.5 million reflects the unfavorable trend on pre-2001 claims.
Additionally, 2001 required a loss of $1.0 million in claims related to the


                                       10
<PAGE>
World Trade Center terrorist attack. As a result of the actuarial report, the
Company has increased its self-insurance rates in 2002 by 21% over 2001. The
estimated future charge is designed to capture the recent experience and trends.
Actual results could be different. Excluding the insurance charge of $0.50 per
diluted share, net income per diluted share declined 3% to $1.80 for 2001 from
$1.85 for 2000 due to the increase in diluted average shares outstanding
resulting from option exercises.

       As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses and cost of goods sold
was 88.3% for 2001, compared to 87.1% in 2000. Consequently, as a percentage of
revenues, the Company's gross profit (revenues minus operating expenses and cost
of goods sold) of 11.7% in 2001 was lower than the gross profit of 12.9% in
2000. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was mostly due to
the $20 million insurance adjustment, higher labor and related costs and
continued competitive pressure to maintain or lower prices.

       Selling, general and administrative expenses were $172 million in 2001,
an increase of 9% from $158 million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues,
selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 8.7% for 2000 to
8.8% for 2001, primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of $3.2 million
over the prior year and to salaries and expenses associated with acquisitions
including the amortization of goodwill.

       Interest expense was $2.6 million in 2001 compared to $3.3 million for
2000, a decrease of $718,000. This decrease was primarily due to lower weighted
average borrowings and interest rates in 2001.

       The effective income tax rate for 2001 was 38%, compared to 39% in 2000.
The lower tax rate was due for the most part to a significant increase in the
federal work opportunity tax credits in relation to pre-tax income.

       The Company is currently organized into eight separate operating
divisions as defined under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information".
However, only the ABM Janitorial, Ampco System Parking, ABM Engineering, Amtech
Lighting, and Amtech Elevator Divisions are reportable using the criteria of
SFAS No. 131. Results of Easterday Janitorial Supply Division are included in
Other Segments prior to its sale on April 29, 2001. Additional information
relating to the Company's industry segments appears in Note 13 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8, "Financial Statements and

reportable operating divisions for 2001 as compared to 2000 are more fully
described below:

       The ABM Janitorial Services Division reported revenues for 2001 of $1.2
billion, an increase of $107 million, or 10%, from 2000. This is the Company's
largest Division and accounted for nearly 60% of the Company's consolidated
revenues in 2001. ABM Janitorial Services revenues increased as a result of
acquisitions and new business, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
regions. Revenues generated from acquisitions during the prior year contributed
$4.8 million of the 2001 increase while the current year acquisitions added
$51.1 million. ABM Janitorial Services' operating profits increased 13% in 2001
to $59.9 million when compared to 2000. The higher percentage increase in
profits compared to revenues can be primarily attributed to the Company's fixed
price contracts on which hourly workers were paid one less workday in 2001
compared to 2000. The change in the number of workdays affects the profit margin
on this type of contract.

       Ampco System Parking revenues decreased by 4% in 2001 from 2000 to $166
million, and its operating profits decreased by 53% to $4.1 million during 2001
compared to 2000. The decrease in revenues was mostly due to the loss of three
airport contracts, the conversion of lease contracts to management fee
contracts, and the effect of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 on
sales at airport and hotel facilities. The decrease in operating profits
resulted from litigation expense, increased insurance costs and the decline in
sales.

       The ABM Engineering Services Division increased revenues by 9% in 2001
from 2000 to $171 million, while its operating profits increased 11% to $9
million for 2001 compared to 2000. The revenue increase was due primarily to
additional business. The increase in operating profits is due to the increase in
sales and slightly higher profit margins as a result of lower administrative
costs.

       Amtech Lighting Services reported a 22% revenue increase to $144 million
in 2001 from 2000 due to acquired business from the purchase of SLI Lighting
Solutions in March 2001, and sales increases in the Northwest region. The
smaller increase in operating profits of 9% to $11 million during 2001 compared
to the prior year is attributable to lower margins in the Southeast on business
acquired in 2001.

       Revenues for Amtech Elevator Services were $121 million, up by 6% for
2001 over 2000, largely due to an increased customer base. The Amtech Elevator
Division reported $4.8 million in operating profits in 2001, a 29% decrease
compared to 2000. This decrease in operating profits can be attributed primarily
to lower margins on maintenance contracts and losses on several modernization
contracts, as well as higher insurance, bad debt, communications and computer
related expenses.

       The significant increase in unallocated Corporate expenses for 2001
includes the $20 million insurance adjustment mentioned previously and
centralization of marketing and sales expenses compared to the prior year.

       Other Segments represent the results of the remaining divisions including
the operating results of Easterday Janitorial Supply Company prior to its sale
effective April 30, 2001, which includes a pre-tax gain on sale of $718,000. The
loss of Easterday's income in the third and fourth quarter of 2001 was more than
offset by the increase in the operating profit of the Company's American
Commercial Security Services and CommAir Mechanical Services Divisions.

COMPARISON OF 2000 TO 1999

       Revenues were $1.8 billion in 2000, up $178 million or 11%, from $1.6
billion reported in 1999. The increase in revenues in 2000 over 1999 was
attributable to new business and acquisitions made during the prior years.
Acquisitions during 2000 accounted for approximately $17.4 million, or 10%, of
the total revenue increase of $178 million for 1999. Net income for 2000 was
$44.3 million, an increase of 12%, compared to net income of $39.7 million in
1999. Diluted net income per common share also rose 12% to $1.85 for 2000
compared to $1.65 for the same period in 1999. On September 22, 1999 the Company
announced a stock repurchase program for up to one million outstanding shares.
As of October 31, 2000, 603,000 shares had been reacquired.

       As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses and cost of goods sold
were 87.1% for 2000, compared to 86.7% in 1999. Consequently, the Company's
gross profit as a percentage of revenues of 12.9% in 2000 was slightly lower
than the gross profit of 13.3% in 1999. The gross profit percentage declined
mostly due to higher labor and related costs, particularly workers' compensation
insurance, and continued competitive pressure to maintain or lower prices. In
addition, the Company's hourly workers were paid two additional workdays in 2000
compared to 1999. On fixed price monthly contacts, such increases are not
recovered.

       Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7.2% for 2000
compared to 1999. However, as a percentage of revenues, selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased from 9.0% for 1999, to 8.7% for 2000,
primarily due to certain costs that do not increase at the same rate as sales.
The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily
due to salaries and expenses associated with acquisitions including the
amortization of goodwill, and costs associated with the implementation of a new
accounting system. The cost increases were somewhat offset by decreased profit
sharing expense.

       Interest expense was $3.3 million in 2000 compared to $2.0 million for
1999, a decrease of $1.3 million. This decrease was primarily due to lower
weighted average borrowings and interest rates in 2000.

       The income before income taxes (pre-tax income) for 2000 was $72.7
million compared to $67.2 million, an increase of 8% over 1999. Pre-tax income
did not increase at the same rate as revenues due to the higher operating
expenses.

       The effective income tax rate for 2000 was 39%, compared to 41% in 1999.
The lower tax rate was due for the most part to a significant increase in the
federal work opportunity tax credits.

       The results of operations from the Company's five reportable operating
divisions for 2000 as compared to 1999 are more fully described below:


                                       12
<PAGE>

       Revenues of the ABM Janitorial Services Division increased by 13% during
2000 to $1.1 billion over 1999, as a result of new business, particularly in the
Mid-Atlantic, Northwest and Southwest regions. Revenues generated from
acquisitions during 1999 contributed about $11.8 million of the 2000 increase
while the 2000 acquisitions added $10.8 million. Operating profits increased 8%
in 2000 to $53.1 million when compared to 1999. The lower percentage increase in
profits can be attributed to low profit margins and high startup costs on some
large contracts in this Division's Southeast region as well as the expense of
extra workdays in fiscal 2000, as discussed previously.

       Ampco System Parking's revenues increased by 6% to $172.4 million, and
its operating profits also increased by 4% to $8.7 million during 2000 compared
to 1999. The increase in revenues and operating profits was mostly due to growth
in California and Texas, along with small acquisitions in Florida, Texas and
Washington.

       The ABM Engineering Services Division increased revenues by 2% to $156.3
million, while its operating profits decreased by 2% to $8.2 million for 2000
compared to 1999. The large revenue increase was due primarily to additional
business obtained in New York City and Southern California. The decrease in
operating profits was due to lower profit margins and increased administrative
costs.

       Amtech Lighting Services reported a 24% revenue increase to $118.4
million in 2000 from 1999 due to increased business in all its markets, except
Northern California, and an acquisition in the Southeast. Operating profits
increased by 35% to $10.1 million during 2000 compared to the prior year. Profit
margins improved due to a reduction in labor and material costs.

       Revenues for Amtech Elevator Services were $114.4 million, up by 18% for
2000 over 1999, largely due to an increased customer base. The Amtech Elevator
Division reported a 3% increase in operating profits in 2000 to $6.8 million
compared to 1999. The smaller increase in operating profits can be attributed
primarily to increased labor, material and insurance costs as well as
computer-related expenses.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

       In fiscal 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (as amended by SFAS Nos. 137 and
138). SFAS No. 133 relates to accounting for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and hedging
activities. It requires that an entity recognizes all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 133 on November 1, 2000; however, the Company is not a party to
any contracts that would meet the definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133.
Upon adoption of this standard there was no effect on the Company's financial
statements.

       In July 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", and SFAS
No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". SFAS No. 141 requires all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. Historically, all acquisitions by the Company
have been accounted for as purchases, thus there was no effect on the Company's
financial statements upon adoption of this standard. SFAS No. 142 becomes
effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with early adoption
permitted. The Company plans to early adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 142
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. In accordance with this standard,
goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual assessment
for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. All other intangible assets
will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill
amortization expense was $12.3 million for the twelve months ended October 31,
2001. The Company's preliminary determination has indicated no impairment of its
goodwill carrying value.

       In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations", which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
associated retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a
liability for an asset


                                       13
<PAGE>
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. SFAS No. 143 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is not
anticipated to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or
financial condition.

       In August 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". SFAS No. 144 supercedes SFAS No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed of", and elements of APB 30, "Reporting the Results of
Operations--Reporting the Effects on Disposal of a Segment of a Business and
Extraordinary, Unusual or Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions". SFAS
No. 144 establishes a single-accounting model for long-lived assets to be
disposed of while maintaining many of the provisions relating to impairment
testing and valuation. SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 31, 2001. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 is not anticipated to have
a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

       Cautionary Safe Harbor Disclosure for Forward Looking Statements under
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Because of the factors set
forth below, as well as other variables affecting the Company's operating
results, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable
indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The statements contained
herein which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that are
subject to meaningful risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: (1)
significant decreases in commercial real estate occupancy, resulting in reduced
demand and prices for building maintenance and other facility services in the
Company's major markets, (2) loss or bankruptcy of one or more of the Company's
major customers, which could adversely affect the Company's ability to collect
its accounts receivable or recover its deferred costs, (3) major collective
bargaining issues that may cause loss of revenues or cost increases that
non-union companies can use to their advantage in gaining market share, (4)
significant shortfalls in adding additional customers in existing and new
territories and markets, (5) a protracted slowdown in the Company's acquisition
activities, (6) legislation or other governmental action that severely impacts
one or more of the Company's lines of business, such as price controls that
could restrict price increases, or the unrecovered cost of any universal
employer-paid health insurance, as well as government investigations that
adversely affect the Company, (7) reduction or revocation of the Company's line
of credit, which would increase interest expense or the cost of capital, (8)
cancellation or nonrenewal of the Company's primary insurance policies, as many
customers contract out services based on the contractor's ability to provide
adequate insurance coverage and limits, (9) catastrophic uninsured or
underinsured claims against the Company, the inability of the Company's
insurance carriers to pay otherwise insured claims, or inadequacy in the
Company's reserve for self-insured claims, (10) inability to employ entry level
personnel due to labor shortages, (11) resignation, termination, death or
disability of one or more of the Company's key executives, which could adversely
affect customer retention and day-to-day management of the Company, and (12)
other material factors that are disclosed from time to time in the Company's
public filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, such
as reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q.

ITEM 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

       The Company does not issue or invest in financial instruments or their
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The operations of the Company
are conducted primarily in the United States, and, as such, are not subject to
material foreign currency exchange rate risk. Although the Company has
outstanding debt and related interest expense, market risk in interest rate
exposure in the United States is currently not material.

ABM Industries Incorporated and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

       PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of ABM Industries Incorporated and its subsidiaries ("the
Company"). All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated. Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to
conform with the current year presentation.

       USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and related notes to financial statements.
Changes in such estimates may affect amounts reported in future periods.

       TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE: The Company's accounts receivable arise from
services provided to its customers and are generally due and payable on terms
varying from the receipt of invoice to net thirty days. The Company does not
believe that it has any material exposure due to either industry or regional
concentrations of credit risk.

       INVENTORIES: Inventories are valued at amounts approximating the lower of
cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

       PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment are stated
at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. At the time property,
plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is reflected in income. Maintenance and repairs are charged against income.

       Depreciation and amortization are calculated principally on the
straight-line method. Lives used in computing depreciation for transportation
equipment average 3 to 5 years and 2 to 20 years for machinery and other
equipment. Buildings are depreciated over periods of 20 to 40 years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the terms of the respective
leases, or the assets' useful lives.

       The Company is implementing an enterprise-wide information system.
External direct costs of materials and services and payroll-related costs of
employees working solely on the development of the system are capitalized.
Capitalized costs of the project are being amortized over a period of seven
years beginning on May 1, 2000. Training costs are expensed as incurred.

       GOODWILL: Goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over fair value
of net tangible assets of businesses acquired, is amortized on a straight-line
basis over periods not exceeding 40 years. It is the Company's policy to carry
goodwill applicable to acquisitions prior to 1971 of $1,433,000 at cost until
such time as there may be evidence of diminution in value.

       INCOME TAXES: Income tax expense is based on reported results of
operations before income taxes. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", deferred income
taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets
and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts
recognized for tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

       REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company earns revenue primarily under service
contracts that are either fixed price or are time and materials based. In both
contract types, revenue is recognized as the services are performed. Under the
fixed price contacts, there are no up-front fee arrangements or


                                       19
<PAGE>

acceptance requirements that would require deferral of revenue recognition under
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101.

       NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company has reported its earnings in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings
per Share". Basic net income per common share, after the reduction for preferred
stock dividends, is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per common share, after the reduction for
preferred stock dividends, is based on the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period, including common stock equivalents. The
calculation of these amounts is as follows:

</TABLE>

       For the purposes of computing diluted net income per common share,
weighted average common share equivalents do not include stock options with an
exercise price that exceeds the average fair market value of the Company's
common stock for the period. On October 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, options to
purchase common shares of 874,000, 1,078,000 and 1,268,000 at a weighted
average exercise price of $32.62, $31.71 and $31.09, respectively, were
excluded from the computation.

       CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid
instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash
equivalents.

       STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company accounts for its stock-based awards
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees".

       COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Comprehensive income consists of net income and
other related gains and losses affecting shareholders' equity that, under
generally accepted accounting principles, are excluded from net income. For the
Company, such comprehensive income items consist of unrealized foreign currency
translation gains and losses.

2.     INSURANCE

       Certain insurable risks such as general liability, property damage and
workers' compensation are self-insured by the Company. However, the Company has
umbrella insurance coverage for certain risk exposures subject to specified
limits. Accruals for claims under the Company's self-insurance program are
recorded on a claim-incurred basis. The accrual includes any general liability,
property damage or workers' compensation claim that as of the applicable
accounting period end was incurred. The Company's method accounts for known
claims and incurred but not reported claims. The claim-incurred method includes
cost factors for inflation and the cost of litigation and administration. The
Company uses independent actuaries to annually evaluate and record the Company's
estimated claim costs and liabilities and accrues an amount that is within an
actuarial range of exposure. The estimated liability for claims incurred but
unpaid at October 31, 2001 and 2000 was $111,692,000 and $90,820,000,
respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company recorded a
$20,000,000 pre-tax expense to strengthen reserves as a result of the actuarial
evaluation. In connection with certain self-insurance agreements, the Company
has standby letters of credit at October 31, 2001 supporting the estimated
unpaid liability in the amount of $39,800,000.

4.     LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENT

       The Company has a $150 million syndicated line of credit which will
expire July 1, 2002. The unsecured revolving credit facility provides, at the
Company's option, interest at the prime rate or IBOR+.35%. The facility calls
for a commitment fee payable quarterly, in arrears, of .12% based on the
average, daily, unused portion. For purposes of this calculation, irrevocable
standby letters of credit issued in conjunction with the Company's
self-insurance program plus cash borrowings are considered to be outstanding
amounts. As of October 31, 2001, the total outstanding amount under this
facility was $52,000,000, comprised of $10,000,000 in loans and $42,000,000 in
standby letters of credit. The interest rate at October 31, 2001, on loans
outstanding under this agreement was 2.9%. The Company is required under this
agreement to maintain certain financial ratios and has limitations on outside
borrowings.

       One of the provisions of the Company's revolving credit facility required
a fixed charge ratio to be maintained at the end of each quarterly reporting
period. As a result of its fiscal 2001 fourth quarter loss, the Company's fixed
charge ratio did not meet this requirement for the quarter ended October 31,
2001. The Company received a waiver from its lenders addressing the deficiency
for the quarter ended October 31, 2001. The Company was in compliance with all
other debt covenants as of October 31, 2001.

       The Company has a loan agreement with a major U.S. bank with a balance of
$1,808,000, at October 31, 2001. This loan bears interest at a fixed rate of
6.78% with annual payments of principal, in varying amounts, and interest due
February 15, 2002 and 2003.

       The long-term debt and credit facility of $11,819,000 matures in the
years ending October 31 as follows: $10,877,000 in 2002 and $942,000 in 2003.

       Long-term debt at October 31, is summarized as follows:

5.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

       All of the Company's employee benefit plans are unfunded, thus there is
no additional pension liability and hence no other comprehensive income to
disclose.

(a)    RETIREMENT AGREEMENTS

       The Company has unfunded retirement agreements for approximately 52
current and former directors and senior executives, many of which are fully
vested. The agreements provide for annual benefits for ten years commencing at
the later of the respective retirement dates of those executives or age 65. The
benefits are accrued over various periods based on expected retirement dates.
During 2001, 2000 and 1999, amounts accrued under these agreements were
$506,000, $684,000 and $674,000, respectively. Payments were made in 2001, 2000
and 1999 in the amounts of $242,000, $171,000 and $231,000, respectively. At
October 31, 2001, the present value of estimated future payments under these
agreements is approximately $4,400,000.

(b)    401(k) AND PROFIT SHARING PLAN

       The Company has a profit sharing and 401(k) plan covering certain
qualified employees, which includes employer participation in accordance with
the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan allows
participants to make pretax contributions and the Company matches certain
percentages of employee contributions depending on the participant's length of
service. The profit sharing portion of the plan is discretionary and
noncontributory. All amounts contributed to the plan are deposited into a trust
fund administered by independent trustees.

       The Company provided for profit sharing contributions of $1,643,000 for
1999. No contribution was provided for fiscal year 2001 and 2000. The Company's
matching 401(k) contributions required by the 401(k) plan for 2001, 2000 and
1999 were approximately $1,534,000, $1,191,000 and $1,210,000, respectively.

       Effective January 1, 2002, the Company is amending its plan to adopt the
"safe harbor" rules of 401(k) plans. These rules contain more generous company
match provisions and cover many employees not previously included. Therefore,
the Company will incur additional future costs, which will be dependent on
increased levels of voluntary participation.

(c)    SERVICE AWARD BENEFIT PLAN

       In 1989, the Company adopted an unfunded service award benefit plan, with
a retroactive vesting period of five years. This plan is a "severance pay plan"
as defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and covers
certain qualified employees. The plan provides participants, upon termination,
with a guaranteed seven days pay for each year of employment subsequent to
November 1, 1989. The Company, at its discretion, may also award additional days
each year.

       Effective January 1, 2002, this plan will be amended to no longer award
any additional days to employees. The enhancement of the 401(k) plan has
replaced benefits previously provided under this plan. The Company will continue
to incur interest costs related to this plan as the value of previously earned
benefits continues to increase.

       Net cost of the plan is comprised of:

(d)    PENSION PLAN UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

       Certain qualified employees of the Company are covered under
union-sponsored collectively bargained multi-employer defined benefit plans.
Contributions for these plans were approximately $30,259,000, $26,913,000 and
$25,516,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These plans are not
administered by the Company and contributions are determined in accordance with
provisions of negotiated labor contracts.

6.     LEASE COMMITMENTS AND RENTAL EXPENSE

       The Company is obligated under noncancelable operating leases for various
facilities and equipment.

       As of October 31, 2001, future minimum lease commitments under
noncancelable operating leases are as follows:

7.     REDEEMABLE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK

       On June 23, 1993, the Company authorized and on September 1, 1993, issued
6,400 shares of preferred stock having a par value of $0.01 per share shares in
conjunction with the acquisition of System Parking. These shares designated as
Series B 8% Senior Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred
Stock) were entitled to one vote per share on all matters upon which common
stockholders were entitled to vote and had a redemption price of $1,000 per
share, together with accrued


                                       23
<PAGE>

and unpaid dividends thereon. Redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock was at
the option of the holders for any or all of the outstanding shares after
September 1, 1998 or at the option of the Company after September 1, 2001. The
total redemption value of the shares outstanding at October 31, 2000 in an
amount of $6,400,000 was classified on the Company's balance sheet as redeemable
cumulative preferred stock. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the affairs of the Company, holders of the Series B Preferred
Stock would have been paid the redemption price plus all accrued dividends to
the date of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of affairs before any payment
to other stockholders.

       On September 4, 2001, the Company redeemed 6,400 shares of Series B 8%
Senior Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock having a par value of $0.01 per
share and redemption price of $1,000 per share.

       Dividends of $128,000 were due and payable each quarter on the Series B
Preferred Stock. In fiscal 2001, $128,000 was paid in each of the first three
quarters and $48,000 was paid for the remaining period at time of redemption.
The dividends were deducted from net income in determining net income per common
share.

8.     CAPITAL STOCK

       The Company is authorized to issue 500,000 shares of preferred stock, of
which 50,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock of $.01 par value. None of these preferred shares have been
issued.

       In March 1998, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a stockholder
rights plan to replace an existing rights plan that expired on April 22, 1998.
The new plan provides for a dividend distribution of one preferred stock
purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock,
distributed to stockholders of record on April 22, 1998. The Rights will be
exercisable only if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company's
common stock (an "Acquiring Person") or announces a tender offer for 20% or more
of the common stock. Each Right will entitle stockholders to buy one-thousandth
of a share of newly created Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Company at an initial exercise price of $175 per Right, subject to
adjustment from time to time. However, if any person becomes an Acquiring
Person, each Right will then entitle its holder (other than the Acquiring
Person) to purchase at the exercise price common stock (or, in certain
circumstances, Participating Preferred Stock) of the Company having a market
value at that time of twice the Right's exercise price. These Rightsholders
would also be entitled to purchase an equivalent number of shares at the
exercise price if the Acquiring Person were to control the Company's Board of
Directors and cause the Company to enter into certain mergers or other
transactions. In addition, if an Acquiring Person acquired between 20% and 50%
of the Company's voting stock, the Company's Board of Directors may, at its
option, exchange one share of the Company's common stock for each Right held
(other than Rights held by the Acquiring Person). Rights held by the Acquiring
Person will become void. The Rights Plan excludes from its operation The
Theodore Rosenberg Trust and The Sydney J. Rosenberg Trust, and certain related
persons, and, as a result, their holdings will not cause the Rights to become
exercisable or nonredeemable or trigger the other features of the Rights. The
Rights will expire on April 22, 2008, unless earlier redeemed by the Board at
$0.01 per Right.

       As discussed in Note 1, the Company continues to account for its
stock-based awards using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees", and its related interpretations. In the three-year period ended
October 31, 2001, the exercise price of all options granted to employees had
equivalent fair market values. Therefore, no compensation expense has been
recognized in the financial statements for employee stock awards.

       Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation", requires the disclosure of pro forma net earnings
and earnings per share had the


                                       24
<PAGE>

Company adopted the fair value method as of the beginning of fiscal 1996. Under
SFAS 123, the fair value of stock-based awards to employees is calculated
through the use of option pricing models. The use of these models requires
subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected
time to exercise, which can have a significant effect on the calculated values.
The Company's calculations were made using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions: expected life 9.2 years,
9.1 years, and 11.9 years from the date of grant in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively; expected stock price volatility of 28.1%, 27.7% and 26.2%,
respectively; expected dividend yields of 2.2%, 3.1% and 1.9%, and risk free
interest rates of 5.3%, 6.7%, and 5.0% in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.

       The Company's calculations are based on a single option valuation
approach and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. If the computed fair
values of the fiscal awards had been amortized to expense over the vesting
period of the awards, pro forma net earnings would have been $29,102,000 ($1.15
per diluted share) for fiscal 2001, $39,477,000 ($1.64 per diluted share) for
fiscal 2000, and $35,409,000 ($1.47 per diluted share) for fiscal 1999. The
impact of outstanding stock options granted prior to fiscal 1996 has been
excluded from the pro forma calculation; accordingly, the fiscal 2001, 2000, and
1999 pro forma adjustments are not indicative of future period pro forma
adjustments, when the calculation will apply to all future applicable stock
grants.

       Under the "Price-Vested" Performance Stock Option Plan options were
granted with a ten-year term. If, during the first four years, the stock price
achieved and maintained a set price for ten out of thirty consecutive trading
days, the options associated with the price would vest. The prices established
were $25, $30, $35 and $40, with 25% of the options vesting at each price point.
If, at the end of four years, any of the stock price performance targets were
not achieved, then the remaining options would vest at the end of eight years
from the date the options were granted. SFAS 123 requires that the projected
value of the options be determined on the grant date and recognized over the
period in which the options are earned (the vesting period). For these options,
the projected value of the options was determined and that value was to be
recognized over the eight-year vesting period unless vesting occurs at an
earlier date. In fiscal 2001 ABM stock achieved and maintained for the requisite
ten-day period, the price required for the third target. As a result, 75% of all
options issued prior to the current fiscal year are now vested, and the
projected value of that 75% less any amounts previously recognized for
outstanding options is recognized in this year's pro forma calculation.
Additionally as a result of the price performance, the options awarded during
the current fiscal year will vest 75% in December 2001, the one-year anniversary
of the grant date. Of the remaining 25% of the granted options yet to be vested,
one-eighth is recognized annually from the grant date, unless vesting occurs at
an earlier date by the stock achieving a price of $40 per share and maintaining
that price for ten out of 30 consecutive trading days.

"TIME-VESTED" INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN, AS AMENDED

       In 1987, the Company adopted a stock option plan under which 1,200,000
shares were reserved for grant until December 31, 1996. In March 1994, this plan
was amended to reserve an additional 1,000,000 shares. In March 1996, the plan
was amended again to reserve another 2,000,000 shares. Options which terminate
without being exercised may be reissued. At October 31, 2001, 637,850 shares
remained available for grant.

       Transactions under this plan are summarized as follows:

"PRICE-VESTED" PERFORMANCE STOCK OPTION PLAN

       In December 1996, the Company adopted a stock option plan under which
1,500,000 shares have been reserved. The options expire 10 years after the date
of grant and any options which terminate without being exercised may be
reissued. Each option will have a pre-defined vesting price which provides for
accelerated vesting if the fair market value of the Company's common stock is
equal to or greater than the pre-defined vesting price for 10 trading days in
any period of 30 consecutive trading days. Vested options will become
exercisable only after the first anniversary of its grant date. Any option that
has not vested prior to the fourth anniversary of its grant date will vest on
the eighth anniversary of its grant date. At October 31, 2001, 100,000 shares
remained available for grant.

       Transactions under this plan are summarized as follows:

"AGE-VESTED" CAREER STOCK OPTION PLAN, AS AMENDED

       In 1984, the Company adopted a stock option plan whereby 680,000 shares
were reserved for grant. In March of 1996, another 1,000,000 shares were
reserved for grant under the plan. As amended December 20, 1994, options which
have been granted at fair market value are 50% exercisable when the option
holders reach their 61st birthday and the remaining 50% will vest on their 64th
birthday. To the extent vested, the options may be exercised at any time prior
to one year after termination of employment. Options which terminate without
being exercised may be reissued. At October 31, 2001, 418,000 shares remained
available for grant.

       Transactions under this plan are summarized as follows:

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, AS AMENDED

       In 1985, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan under which
sale of 5 million shares of its common stock has been authorized. In March of
1996 and 1999, sales of an additional 1,200,000 shares each were authorized, and
again in March of 2001, 1,200,000 additional shares were authorized under this
plan. The purchase price of the shares under the plan is the lesser of 85% of
the fair market value at the commencement of each plan year or 85% of the fair
market value on the date of purchase. Employees may designate up to 10% of their
compensation for the purchase of stock. During 2001, 2000, and 1999, 527,000,
635,000, and 602,000 shares of stock were issued under the plan for an aggregate
purchase price of $12,142,000, $12,588,000 and $13,632,000, respectively. The
weighted average fair value of those purchase rights granted in 2001, 2000, and
1999 was $7.00, $7.27, and $7.32, respectively, and were issued at a weighted
average price of $23.04, $19.84 and $23.25, respectively. At October 31, 2001,
930,000 shares remained unissued under the plan.

10.    ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

       All acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting; operations of the companies and businesses acquired have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from their
respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over fair
value of the net assets acquired is generally included in goodwill. Most
purchase agreements provide for contingent payments based on the annual pretax
income for subsequent periods ranging generally from three to five years. Any
such future payments are generally capitalized as goodwill when paid. Cash paid
for acquisitions, including any contingent amounts based on subsequent earnings,
was $23,401,000 in 2001. In addition, common shares, with a fair market value of
$1,666,000 at the date of issuance, were issued in 2001 under the contingent
payment provisions of a prior year acquisition. As these acquisitions were not
significant, pro forma information is not included in these financial
statements.

       Acquisitions and dispositions made during the fiscal year 2001 are
discussed below:

       Effective February 1, 2001, the Company acquired the operations and
selected assets of Arcade Cleaning L.P., a janitorial services company, with
customers located in the Northeast and Midwest regions. The terms included a
cash payment made at closing plus annual contingent payments based on operating
profits to be made over five years. This acquisition contributed $47,141,000 in
revenues in fiscal year 2001.

       Effective March 26, 2001, the Company acquired selected customer
contracts and certain assets of SLI Lighting Solutions, a lighting services
company, with customers in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions. The terms
included a cash payment made at closing plus semi-annual contingent payments
based on gross profits to be made over three years. This acquisition contributed
$13,455,000 in revenues in fiscal year 2001.

       Effective April 1, 2001, the Company acquired the operations and selected
assets of CarpetMaster Cleaning, a provider of janitorial and related services
in Albany and the surrounding capital district of New York. The terms included a
cash payment, of which 51% was made at closing and 49% paid in May 2001, plus
annual contingent payments based on operating profits to be made over five
years. This acquisition contributed $3,946,000 in revenues in fiscal year 2001.

       Effective June 11, 2001, the Company acquired the operations and selected
assets of Sundown Security, Inc., a security services company, with customers
located in the Sacramento, California area. The terms included a cash payment
made at closing plus annual contingent payments based on


                                       29
<PAGE>

operating profits to be made over five years. This acquisition contributed
$1,130,000 in revenues in fiscal year 2001.

       The aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions was $11,749,000
including $7,222,000 allocated to goodwill.

       Effective April 30, 2001, the Company sold its Easterday Janitorial
Supply Division to AmSan West, Inc. In fiscal 2000, this Division had annual
revenues of $43,868,000, of which 27% were intercompany sales, and assets of
$11,574,000. In 2001, this Division contributed $15,054,000 in revenues after
intercompany sales elimination. The sale of Easterday will allow the Company to
focus on its building maintenance and other operational services. The sale does
not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated net assets, financial
position or results of operations. The sales price for Easterday was
$12,000,000, which was received on May 1, 2001. Included in operating profits
for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001, is a pre-tax gain of $718,000.

11.    DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

       The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash
equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-maturity of these
instruments.

       Financial instruments included in investments and long-term receivables
have no quoted market prices and, accordingly, a reasonable estimate of fair
market value could not be made without incurring excessive costs. However, the
Company believes by reference to stated interest rates and security held that
the fair value of the assets would not differ significantly from the carrying
value.

       The fair value of the Company's long-term debt approximates carrying
value based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the
current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities.

12.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

       The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named defendants in
certain litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management, based on advice of legal counsel, such matters should have no
material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

13.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

       Under Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131,
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" segment
information is presented under the management approach. The management approach
designates the internal organization that is used by management for making
operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's
reportable segments. SFAS 131 also requires disclosures about products and
services, geographic areas and major customers. The Company is organized into
nine separate operating segments as defined under SFAS 131. However, only the
ABM Janitorial, Amtech Elevator, ABM Engineering, Amtech Lighting and Ampco
System Parking operating segments are reportable using the quantitative
threshold criteria under SFAS 131. Included in other segments are ABM Service
Network, American Commercial Security, CommAir Mechanical Services, and
Easterday Janitorial Supply Company that was sold, as previously reported,
during the second quarter of fiscal year 2001. In addition, the corporate
expenses are not allocated. The significant increase in unallocated Corporate
expenses for 2001 includes the $20 million insurance adjustment mentioned
previously and centralization of marketing and sales expenses compared to the
prior year. All of these segments are distinct business units. They are managed
separately because of their unique services, technology and marketing
requirements. Nearly 100% of the operations and related revenues are within the
United States and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of sales.
