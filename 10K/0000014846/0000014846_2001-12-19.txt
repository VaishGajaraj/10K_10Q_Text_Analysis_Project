Item l.  Business.
         --------

General

     BRT is a real estate investment trust organized as a business trust in 1972
under the laws of the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts  (all references  herein to
"BRT" or the "Trust" include BRT's wholly-owned  subsidiaries).  BRT's principal
business  activity  is  to  generate  income  by  originating  and  holding  for
investment  for its own account,  senior real estate  mortgage  loans secured by
income  producing  real property and to a lesser extent  second  mortgage  loans
secured by income  producing  real  property.  BRT  emphasizes  loans with terms
ranging from six months to three years  (referred to as bridge loans) to persons
requiring  short term  funds,  among other  reasons,  for the  acquisition  of a
property,  the purchase  (normally at a discount) of a mortgage  applicable to a
property owned by the borrower,  repositioning,  rehabilitating  or renovating a
property or converting a commercial  property to residential use (co-op or condo
conversions).  BRT does not  finance  new  construction  and  normally  does not
provide  financing for undeveloped real property.  In the last two fiscal years,
BRT has expanded its activities by originating for its own account participating
mortgage  loans  and by  participating  as  both  a  lender  to  and  an  equity
participant in joint ventures which acquire income  producing real property (see
"Investment Policy" below).

     Although BRT will originate and hold for  investment  loans secured by real
property  located  anywhere in the United States and Puerto Rico, its activities
are focused on the New York  metropolitan  area, New Jersey and Connecticut.  At
September 30, 2001 BRT had  $67,928,000  principal  amount of loans  outstanding
(62% of total  assets),  of which 29% were secured by properties  located in New
York City, Nassau and Suffolk counties,  42% were secured by properties  located
in the New York  metropolitan  area,  New  Jersey and  Connecticut  and 21% were
secured by  properties  located in the state of Florida.  During the 2001 fiscal
year, BRT originated  $44,276,000  principal amount of loans, it had payoffs and
paydowns of $20,011,000 principal amount of loans and it earned $911,000 of loan
related fees.

     Substantially  all mortgage loans  originated and held by BRT bear interest
at a floating  rate related to the prime rate  (referred to as  adjustable  rate
mortgages)  with a stated minimum  interest rate. The interest rate adjusts when
the prime rate changes but not below the stated  minimum  interest  rate.  Since
only a  minimal  amount  of  leverage  has  been  used  by  BRT  in its  lending
activities,  a decrease in the prime rate will negatively impact BRT's revenues,
but this impact is minimized due to a significant  portion of BRT's loans having
a stated  minimum  interest  rate.  Interest  on  mortgage  loans held by BRT is
payable monthly and BRT usually holds escrows,  also payable  monthly,  for real
estate taxes and insurance  (casualty and  liability)  premiums.  BRT receives a
commitment  fee on all  mortgage  loans it  originates  and usually  receives an
extension  fee in  connection  with  the  extension  of a loan.  These  fees are
generally  paid  at the  time a loan  is  funded  or  extended.  Commitment  and
extension fees are taken into income over the life of the commitment  and/or the
loan.  If BRT issues a commitment  and the loan is not  consummated,  the fee is
recognized at the expiration of the commitment. A non-refundable  processing fee
(which  includes an advance  against  projected legal fees to be incurred by BRT
and other  projected  miscellaneous  costs) is  received  on  substantially  all
commitments.

     In the fiscal year ended  September 30, 1998,  BRT,  through a wholly-owned
subsidiary,  originated longer term senior real estate mortgage loans secured by
income producing real property,  primarily multi-family properties.  These loans
provided  for a fixed  rate of  interest,  had an  initial  five-year  term  and
provided for  amortization  of principal over 20 to 25 years. In the fiscal year
ended  September 30, 1999,  BRT sold to a banking  institution,  at par,  senior
participations  in  $9,399,000   principal  amount  of  the  longer  term  loans
originated by it, with BRT retaining a junior  participation  in the loans sold.
The interest rate paid to the institution  acquiring the senior participation is
somewhat  less  than the  interest  rate  provided  for in the  applicable  loan
documents,  thereby  enhancing  the  return  to BRT on the  retained  junior  or
subordinated  position.  Since the junior position is subordinate to the payment
in full of the senior position, it is a riskier investment and in the event of a
default  under the  mortgage,  BRT will have to determine if it will protect its
position by paying out the senior  portion.  At September  30, 2001,  $5,894,000
principal  amount of loans  originated by its subsidiary and $561,000  principal
amount  of  junior   participations  in  loans  originated  by  its  subsidiary,
representing  9.50% of BRT's  mortgage  portfolio,  were held in BRT's  mortgage
portfolio.  In view of the highly  competitive market for this conventional type
lending  activity,  BRT Funding  Corp.  discontinued  activity in this market in
December  1998.  BRT is currently  engaged in discussions to sell all, or senior
participations in, the balance of the conventional type loans held by BRT in its
mortgage portfolio.

     At September  30, 2001 BRT's  mortgage  portfolio  consisted of 42 mortgage
loans totaling  $66,547,000 in aggregate  principal amount (net of allowances of
$1,381,000),  representing 60% of BRT's total assets.  At September 30, 2001 all
outstanding loans, except for one first mortgage loan in the principal amount of
$415,000  (with no allowance  for loan losses)  were earning  interest.  The one
mortgage loan not earning  interest  represents  less than 1% of the outstanding
loan  portfolio at September 30, 2001. BRT expects to recover the full principal
amount and the unpaid interest on this non-earning loan.

     Of the principal  amount of loans  outstanding  at September 30, 2001,  65%
represented  first mortgage loans and 35%  represented  second  mortgage  loans,
wrap-around  loans and junior  participations.  There were no loans  outstanding
secured by undeveloped real property.

     During  the  fiscal  year  ending   September  30,  2001,  in  addition  to
originating  mortgage  loans,  BRT was engaged in managing  its loan  portfolio,
supervising  the management of real estate assets owned by BRT,  supervising the
activities of joint  ventures in which BRT is involved as an equity  participant
and leasing and selling real estate  assets.  Approximately,  12% of BRT's total
assets at September 30, 2001, or an aggregate of  $13,383,000  (after  valuation
allowances)  was  represented  by real estate assets  (excluding  mortgage loans
receivable), including investments in joint ventures.

     In  December  1999 (the  first  quarter  of the 2000  Fiscal  Year),  BRT's
management  recommended  to its  Board of  Trustees  and the  Board of  Trustees
authorized the investment of a portion of BRT's  available cash in securities of
other publicly  traded real estate  investment  trusts.  The  recommendation  of
management  and the  authorization  by the  Board of  Trustees  was based on the
following  considerations:  (i) in the  opinion of  management  and the Board of
Trustees the securities of many publicly  traded real estate  investment  trusts
were  undervalued;  (ii) the yields on the securities of real estate  investment
trusts was  significantly  greater  than the yields  obtainable  from other REIT
qualifying  investments  without  a  substantial  increase  in risk,  and  (iii)
investments  in the  securities  of other  real  estate  investment  trusts  are
qualifying investments for REIT qualification purposes.  Purchases of securities
of other publicly  traded real estate  investment  trusts  commenced in December
1999,  subsequent to the Board's  authorization.  At September  30, 2001,  BRT's
balance sheet  reflects an investment of  $24,030,000 in the securities of other
real estate investment  trusts (22% of total assets),  of which $22,909,000 (21%
of total assets)  represents an investment in the common shares of Entertainment
Properties Trust ("EPR"). BRT currently owns 1,355,600 shares of Common Stock of
EPR,  or  9.21%  of  EPR's  outstanding  shares,  at a cost of  $17,806,000.  At
September  30, 2001,  BRT has an  unrealized  gain on its  investment  in EPR of
$5,103,000, and $175,000, of net unrealized gain on the securities of other real
estate investment  trusts.  For a further  discussion of BRT's investment in EPR
and the business of EPR, see "Investment in EPR" below.

     With respect to real estate which BRT has taken back in foreclosure or deed
in lieu thereof, it has been BRT's policy to offer for sale all such real estate
at prices which management believes represents fair value in the geographic area
in which the property is located.  At September  30, 2001,  BRT's  balance sheet
reflects  ownership of real estate taken back in foreclosure  of $2,898,000.  In
the year ended  September  30, 2001,  BRT sold shares (and  assigned the related
proprietary  leases) in  cooperative  apartments  resulting  in net  proceeds of
approximately  $623,000 and gain on sale of  $506,000.  In the 2001 fiscal year,
BRT also disposed of its residual interest in a real estate venture for proceeds
of  $1,431,000.  This  interest  which  had no  basis,  resulted  in a  gain  of
$1,431,000. There were no other sales of real estate assets in Fiscal 2001.

Investment Policy

     BRT's investment policy  emphasizes  short-term senior real estate mortgage
loans secured by first liens on income  producing  real property and to a lesser
extent  junior real estate  loans  secured by income  producing  real  property.
Junior  mortgage  loans  are  subordinate  to one or more  prior  liens.  Junior
mortgage  loans may be wrap-around  loans which are subject to prior  underlying
mortgage indebtedness. In the case of a wrap-around mortgage loan, the principal
amount on which interest payable is calculated is the outstanding  balance under
the prior  existing  mortgage loan plus the amount  actually  advanced under the
wrap-around  loan.  The terms of a  wrap-around  loan  normally  require  that a
borrower make  principal and interest  payments  directly to BRT and BRT in turn
pays the holder of the prior mortgage loan.

     The Trust also  originates  participating  mortgage  loans. A participating
mortgage loan (which is generally secured by a first mortgage lien) provides for
a floating  interest  rate  (related  to the prime  rate)  which is usually at a
somewhat  lesser  base  rate than the rate  charged  by BRT on its  bridge  type
mortgage  loans,  is  usually  for a longer  term and  provides  for  payment of
"additional  or  appreciation  interest"  either  at the  time  of the  sale  or
refinancing  of the  property  securing the loan or at the maturity of the loan.
The additional  interest is usually calculated based on the incremental value of
the property securing the mortgage (from the date the loan is consummated to the
date the loan is paid off), but can also be based on the period of time the loan
is outstanding,  the profit realized by the borrower on the sale of the property
securinig the loan or other negotiated  criteria.  At September 30, 2001 BRT had
$5,117,000 of principal amount participating mortgage loans outstanding.

     BRT also  originates  short term mortgage loans (first and second  mortgage
loans)  to  joint  ventures  in  which  BRT  is  an  equity  participant.  If  a
determination  is  made  by  management  that  an  investment  will  provide  an
opportunity  for above  market  returns and an  opportunity  to  participate  in
capital  appreciation,  BRT will make an equity investment on a pari passu basis
with its  borrower,  and make a short term loan to the  venture.  Joint  venture
transactions  are usually  entered into with  borrowers  who have  established a
favorable  record with BRT and provide for a repayment of interest and principal
on the loan portion of the transaction  before any distributions are made to the
equity  participants.  At September  30, 2001,  BRT had  $6,931,000  invested in
unconsolidated   joint  ventures  and   $3,425,000  of  second   mortgage  loans
outstanding  to these joint  ventures.  At September 30, 2001, BRT had an equity
investment of $1,336,000 in a consolidated joint venture and advanced $2,400,000
as a first mortgage loan to the entity to provide  sufficient funds to acquire a
property  (all of  which  was  repaid  in the 2001  fiscal  year  from  mortgage
financing  from an unrelated  party).  Any mortgage  loan made by BRT to a joint
venture in which it is an equity participant is secured by the property owned by
the venture.

     BRT has no fixed policy or  limitation  on the amount or  percentage of its
assets  which it may  invest in a single  mortgage  loan.  During the year ended
September 30, 2001 the average loan originated was approximately $3,300,000. The
largest  loan   originated   in  2001  was   $12,000,000   (which  is  currently
outstanding).  There are no other loans outstanding to this borrower.  It is not
the present  intent of BRT's  management  to cause BRT to originate or otherwise
invest in any mortgage secured by property located outside the United States and
Puerto Rico.

     BRT's  lending  activities  are  nationwide,   with  loans  outstanding  at
September 30, 2001 being secured by properties located in 8 states. However, the
focus of BRT's lending  activities is the New York  metropolitan area (including
the counties of Nassau,  Suffolk and  Westchester) and the states of Connecticut
and New  Jersey.  Lack of  geographic  diversification  exposes  BRT to a higher
potential risk of loss from regional economic and business factors.

     Loan  approvals  and  approval  of joint  venture  investments  of the type
described  above are based on a review of an  application  that is prepared  and
submitted by the proposed borrower,  and considerable due diligence  activities,
including  site visits to the  property by at least two officers of BRT, a title
review of the underlying property, in-house property appraisals, a review of the
results of operations of the property,  and a review of the financial  statement
of the  prospective  borrower.  Final  approval by a loan  committee  made up of
executive  officers of BRT must be obtained  before a commitment  is issued.  In
addition,  in most  instances,  BRT has an engineering  inspection and a Phase I
environmental  study  conducted,  both of which  are  paid for by the  potential
borrower. BRT does not require a property appraisal by an independent appraiser.

     BRT uses its own capital for investing in mortgage loans.  In addition,  it
has  arranged  a credit  facility  with  North  Fork Bank  ("NFB") to make funds
available for real estate mortgage lending. Under the Credit Facility, NFB makes
available up to $15,000,000 on a revolving  basis.  The maximum amount which can
be  outstanding  under  the  Credit  Facility  is the  greater  of 60% of  first
mortgages pledged to NFB and $15,000,000,  but no more than 20% principal amount
of the  pledged  loans  may be on  properties  located  outside  of the New York
metropolitan  area  (defined  in the loan  agreement  as New York,  New  Jersey,
Connecticut and Pennsylvania).  At November 30, 2001,  $10,800,000 was available
under the  facility,  none of which was  outstanding.  The  facility  matures on
August 1, 2004, with two one year extensions  available to BRT. Borrowings under
the facility  bear  interest at prime plus 1/2 of 1%, but the rate is reduced to
prime if certain  compensating  balance requirements are met. The loan agreement
contains  certain  affirmative and negative  covenants,  including a minimum net
worth  requirement and a required debt coverage ratio. BRT is in compliance with
all covenants. Borrowings will be made by BRT under this facility if loan demand
increases and BRT's management  determines,  after examination of the underlying
property,  loan application and completion of its due diligence,  that it should
expand its loan  portfolio.  Use of  leverage  will  increase  yield,  since the
spreads between interest paid on the credit line and interest paid by a borrower
can range from four to six percent.  Use of leverage will impose additional risk
on BRT.

     The mortgage loans which BRT originates are usually with full recourse, but
are not insured,  in whole or in part, as to  collectability.  BRT will obtain a
personal guarantee or, alternatively a "walk-away  guarantee" from the principal
or principals of the borrower for most loans originated. A "walk-away guarantee"
provides in substance that the guarantee  terminates if the borrower conveys the
property  to  BRT,  provided  that  at  the  time  of  conveyance  interest  and
amortization  payments to BRT are  current,  real  estate  taxes are current and
outstanding  bills  related  to  the  property's  operations  are  current.  The
"walk-away guarantee" is intended to provide an incentive to the principals of a
borrower to deed a property to BRT, in lieu of foreclosure,  thereby eliminating
the need for foreclosure, in situations in which the borrower is not financially
able or capable of operating the property on a cash flow positive basis and runs
the risk of losing the property in a foreclosure.

     Loan defaults will reduce BRT's current return and may require it to become
involved in  expensive  and time  consuming  procedures,  including  foreclosure
and/or  bankruptcy  proceedings.  In the event of a default by the borrower on a
mortgage loan, BRT will foreclose the mortgage or seek to protect its investment
through  negotiations with the borrower and or other interested  parties,  which
may involve further cash outlays.  During a mortgage foreclosure  proceeding BRT
will  usually not receive  interest  payments  under its  mortgage.  Foreclosure
proceedings in certain jurisdictions can take a considerable period of time (two
years  or more in many  instances).  In  addition,  if the  borrower  files  for
protection  under the federal  bankruptcy laws during the  foreclosure  process,
delays  may be  longer.  In a  foreclosure  proceeding,  BRT will seek to have a
receiver  appointed by the Court or an independent  third party property manager
appointed (with the borrower's agreement) in order to preserve the rental income
stream and provide for the maintenance of the property. At the conclusion of the
foreclosure or negotiated workout process (after the property is sold at auction
to a third party purchaser or acquired by BRT or another investor or the workout
process  results in the borrower or its designee  retaining  the  property)  the
amounts  collected  by the receiver or the third party  manager,  less costs and
expenses of operating  the property and the  receiver's or manager's  fees,  are
usually paid over to BRT. No foreclosure  proceedings  were pending at September
30, 2001.

     In instances in which BRT invests in junior  mortgage  loans,  sells senior
participations   in  loans   (retaining  the  junior  position)  or  invests  in
wrap-around  loans,  the mortgages  securing BRT's loans are  subordinate to the
liens of senior  mortgages  or senior  participations.  At  September  30,  2001
approximately  35% of BRT's real estate  mortgages  were  represented  by junior
mortgages,  junior  participations or wrap-around  mortgage loans.  Although the
Trust seeks to protect itself by obtaining  title  insurance in connection  with
each loan it originates, in certain circumstances a mortgage owned by BRT may be
subordinate to mechanic's liens or government liens. In the event the underlying
asset value is not sufficient to satisfy both the senior and junior  lienholder,
the junior lienholder could lose all or a portion of its investment.  In certain
cases,  BRT may  find it  advisable  to make  additional  payments  in  order to
maintain the current  status of prior liens or to discharge  them entirely or to
make working capital advances to support current operations. It is possible that
the total  amount  which may be  recovered  in cases in which BRT holds a junior
lien or  junior  participation  may be  less  than  its  total  investment  less
allowances for possible losses.

Current Loan Status

     BRT's lending  activities  focus on  multi-family  residential  properties,
office buildings,  shopping centers, and industrial  buildings.  As of September
30,  2001  BRT  had 42  mortgage  loans  in  its  mortgage  portfolio,  totaling
$67,928,000 in aggregate  principal amount and $66,547,000  after allowances for
possible  losses  of  $1,381,000.  During  the year  ended  September  30,  2001
$44,276,000  of mortgage loans were  originated  and  $20,011,000 of outstanding
loans  were  repaid  in whole or in  part.  The  three  largest  mortgage  loans
outstanding   at  September  30,  2001  represent   10.91%,   6.36%  and  4.86%,

more than 3.31% of BRT's total assets at September 30, 2001.

     Loan  originations  are  generated  by BRT in a number of ways.  To a large
extent,  BRT relies on the  relationships  developed by its management with real
estate  investors,  commercial real estate  brokers,  and mortgage  bankers.  In
addition, BRT advertises its programs and activities in real estate publications
and journals and its executive  officers and loan  originators  attend  industry
activities and trade shows.  BRT has experienced a great deal of repeat business
with its borrowers.

         (2) Includes $3,057,000 of senior participations and the $7,500,000
underlying first mortgage position of a wraparound mortgage. BRT holds junior
participations of $340,000 on these loans.

         (3) Includes $1,992,000 of senior participantions.  BRT holds junior
participations of $221,000 on these loans.

     At September 30, 2001, BRT had  allowances for possible  losses on its real
estate  mortgage loans of $1,381,000.  In determining the allowance for possible
loan  losses,  BRT  takes  into  account  numerous  factors  including  a market
evaluation of the underlying  collateral,  the underlying  property's  estimated
cash flow during the projected holding period and estimated sales value computed
by applying an expected  capitalization  rate to the  stabilized  net  operating
income of the specific  property,  less estimated  selling costs. BRT also takes
into account the extent of liquidity in the real estate  industry,  particularly
in  the  New  York  metropolitan  area  (New  York  City,  Nassau,  Suffolk  and
Westchester  counties),  where  approximately  29% of the  portfolio is located.
Management  monitors  a  borrowers  performance  and  compliance  with  the loan
doucments  and where BRT holds a second lien, it monitors the status of payments
to the  first  mortgagee.  BRT's  management  reviews  the loan  portfolio  on a
quarterly basis to determine if allowances are needed.

     When a mortgage loan is in default, BRT may acquire the underlying property
through  foreclosure  or may take other legal  action as is necessary to protect
its investment.  In negotiated workouts BRT seeks to acquire title to a property
and in certain  cases  affords the borrower  the  opportunity  to reacquire  the
property at a fixed price over a specified period of time.

Investment in EPR

     As  of  September  30,  2001,   BRT  owned   1,355,600   common  shares  of
Entertainment Properties Trust (NYSE:EPR),  constituting  approximately 9.21% of
the 14,723,726 common shares of EPR outstanding. The shares were purchased for a
total consideration of $17,806,000,  or an average cost of $13.14 per share. The
value of this  investment was  $22,909,000,  or $16.90 per share as of September
30, 2001. In calendar 2001, EPR paid or declared cash dividends to  shareholders
totaling  $1.80 per share,  providing  BRT with an annual  yield of 13.7% on its
investment.  In early 2001 BRT  proposed  Fredric H.  Gould,  Chairman  of BRT's
Board, for election to the EPR Board and solicited proxies on Mr. Gould's behalf
and in opposition to the nominee of EPR's  management.  The nominee  proposed by
EPR's management was reelected to the Board.

         EPR's Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2000
states the following with respect to EPR's business:

         "Entertainment Properties Trust (the `Company') was formed on August
22, 1997 as a Maryland real estate investment trust (`REIT') to capitalize on
the opportunities created by the development of destination entertainment and
entertainment-related properties, including megaplex movie theatre complexes.
The Company completed an initial public offering (`IPO') of its common shares of
beneficial interest (`Shares') on November 18, 1997. The Company is the first
publicly-traded REIT formed exclusively to invest in entertainment-related
properties.

         The Company is a self-administered REIT. As of December 31, 2000, the
Company's real estate portfolio was comprised primarily of 26 megaplex theatre
properties, including joint venture properties, located in eleven states, one
entertainment-themed related center (`ETRC') development property located in
Westminister, Colorado and land parcels leased to restaurant operators and
related properties adjacent to several of its theatre properties. The Company's
theatre properties are leased to leading theatre operators, including American
Multi-Cinema, Inc. (`AMC'), a subsidiary of AMC Entertainment, Inc. (`AMCE'),
Muvico Entertainment LLC (`Muvico'), Edwards Theatre Circuits, Inc. (`Edwards'),
Consolidated Theatres (`Consolidated') and Loews Cineplex Entertainment
(`Loews').

     The Company  believes  entertainment  is an important  sector of the retail
real estate  industry and that, as a result of the Company's focus on properties
in this  sector  and the  industry  relationships  of its  management,  it has a
competitive  advantage  in  providing  capital to  operators  of these  types of
properties.  The  principal  business  strategy  of the  Company is to  continue
acquiring    high-quality     properties    leased    to    entertainment    and
entertainment-related  business operators,  generally under long-term triple-net
leases that require the tenant to pay substantially all expenses associated with
the operation and maintenance of the property.

     Megaplex  theatres  typically have at least 14 screens with stadium - style
seating (seating with elevation  between rows to provide  unobstructed  viewing)
and are equipped with amenities that significantly  enhance the audio and visual
experience  of the patron.  The Company  believes  the  development  of megaplex
theatres has  accelerated  the  obsolesce  of many  existing  movie  theatres by
setting new standards for movie-goers,  who, in the Company's  experience,  have
demonstrated  their  preference  for the  more  attractive  surroundings,  wider
variety of films and superior customer service typical of megaplex theatres ...

     The Company expects the development of megaplex theatres to continue in the
United  States  and  abroad  for the  foreseeable  future.  As a  result  of the
significant  capital  commitment  involved in building these  properties and the
experience and industry  relationships of the Company's management,  the Company
believes it will continue to have opportunities to provide capital to businesses
that seek to develop  and operate  these  properties  but would  prefer to lease
rather  than own the  properties.  The Company  believes  its ability to finance
these properties will enable it to continue to grow and diversify its asset base
 . . . "

     Discussion  in this Form 10K of the business of EPR is taken  verbatim from
EPR's Form 10-K for the year ended  December  31,  2000.  BRT has only  included
those portions of the Annual Report of EPR which it determined was necessary for
an  understanding  of the  business of EPR,  and the above  discussion  of EPR's
business is  qualified  in its  entirety by  reference to EPR's Form 10K for the
year ending  December  31, 2000,  (including  a  discussion  of the Risk Factors
applicable to EPR's business,  operations and industry, the financial statements
of EPR, and  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and
Results  of  Operations),  as well as all Form  10Q's and Form 8K's filed by EPR
since January 1, 2001. BRT has no knowledge of the business, financial condition
or results of operations of EPR, other than as set forth in the reports filed by
EPR with the  Securities and Exchange  Commission,  published  industry  reports
related to the exhibition of motion  pictures and analysts  reports  relating to
EPR.  Reference is made to EPR's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000,
its Form 10-Q for the quarters  ended March 31, June 30 and  September  30, 2001
and to its Forms 8-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  for
information  concerning  EPR's  business,  financial  condition  and  results of
operations.

Competition

     With  respect to its real  estate  lending  activities,  BRT  competes  for
acceptable  investments  with other REITs,  commercial  banks,  savings and loan
associations,  conduits,  pension funds, private lending companies, and mortgage
banking firms. Competition for mortgage loans, particularly mortgages secured by
multi-family  residential  properties,  is  highly  competitive,   with  lenders
competing on rate,  fees,  amounts  committed,  term and service.  Many of BRT's
competitors possess greater financial and other resources than those of BRT. BRT
competes by offering  quick  response  time in terms of approval  and closing to
satisfy  the needs of its  customer  base and may  offer a higher  loan to value
ratio than institutional competitors.  In addition, the experience and expertise
of its management in real estate and real estate  lending  provides BRT with the
ability to structure loans which solve a potential borrowers unique issues while
satisfying BRT's underwriting standards.


Employees

     BRT has 11 full-time  employees,  of which 3 are engaged  primarily in loan
origination activities. In addition, BRT has entered into an agreement with REIT
Management Corp. pursuant to which REIT Management Corp. acts as its advisor. At
the present time,  REIT  Management,  subject to  supervision  of BRT's Board of
Trustees,  participates in originating,  investigation and evaluating investment
opportunities,  administers BRT's portfolio of mortgages receivables, engages in
negotiations  in workout  situations  with respect to non-earning and delinquent
loans and supervises  and provides  support  services in litigation  activities.
REIT  Management  Corp. also supervises the  maintenance,  leasing,  sale and/or
financing  of real  estate  owned by BRT and  joint  ventures  in  which  BRT is
involved as a venturer.  Reference is made to BRT's Proxy  Statement to be filed
pursuant to Regulation 14A for  information  concerning the amount and method of
computing REIT Management Corp.'s fee.

     BRT engages entities,  including  entities  affiliated with REIT Management
Corp., to manage properties (including  cooperative  apartments) acquired by BRT
in foreclosure  or deed in lieu of  foreclosure  and joint ventures in which BRT
has an equity interest.  The management  services  include,  among other things,
rent  billing  and  collection,  accounting,  property  maintenance,  contractor
negotiation,  construction management, sales, leasing and mortgage brokerage. In
management's  judgment  the fees  paid to REIT  Management  Corp.  and  entities
affiliated  with REIT Management  Corp. are  competitive  with or less than fees
that would be charged for comparable services by unrelated entities.

Item 2.  Properties.
         ----------

     BRT's executive offices are located at 60 Cutter Mill Road, Great Neck, New

</TABLE>


         As of November 30, 2001 there were approximately 925 holders of record
of BRT's Beneficial Shares and approximately 2,500 shareholders.

     BRT  qualifies  as a real estate  investment  trust for Federal  income tax
purposes.  In order to maintain that status, it is required to distribute to its
shareholders  at  least  90%  of its  annual  taxable  income.  As a  result  of
accumulated  tax  losses  BRT was not  required  to make cash  distributions  to
maintain  its real estate  investment  trust status  until its  accumulated  tax
losses  had been  fully  used.  Accumulated  tax  losses  were fully used in the
quarter ending March 31, 2001 and accordingly  the Board of Trustees  authorized
the resumption of cash distributions,  with the initial  distribution being made
on July 3, 2001 to record  holders  of June 22,  2001.  The amount and timing of
future distributions will be at the discretion of the Board of Trustees and will
depend upon BRT's financial  condition,  earnings,  business plan, cash flow and
other factors.  Provided BRT is not in default of its  affirmative  and negative
covenants,  the credit  agreement  with North  Fork Bank does not  preclude  the
payment by BRT of the cash  distributions  necessary to maintain its status as a
real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
         ---------------------------------------------------------------
         Results of Operations
         ---------------------

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     BRT engages in the  business  of  originating  and  holding for  investment
senior real  estate  mortgages  secured by income  producing  property  and to a
lesser extent  junior real estate  mortgage  loans  secured by income  producing
property.  It's investment policy emphasizes  short-term mortgage loans. It also
originates  participating mortgage loans and loans to joint ventures in which it
is an equity  participant.  Repayments  of real  estate  loans in the  amount of
$46,031,000  are due  during  the  twelve  months  ending  September  30,  2002,
including  $4,067,000  due on demand.  The  availability  of mortgage  financing
secured by real  property  and the market for selling  real estate is  cyclical.
Accordingly,  BRT cannot project the portion of loans  maturing  during the next
twelve  months which will be paid or the portion of loans which will be extended
for a fixed term or on a month to month basis.

     On July 25, 2001, BRT consummated a $15,000,000  revolving  credit facility
with North Fork Bank ("NFB") The  facility  provides  for  borrowings  up to the
greater of $15,000,000 or 60% of qualified  first mortgage loans pledged to NFB,
provided  that no more than 20% of the  pledged  loans may relate to  properties
situated outside of the New York metropolitan area (as defined). $12,200,000 was
available under this line at September 30, 2001.

     During the twelve months ended  September 30, 2001,  BRT generated  cash of
$7,683,000  from operating  activities,  $2,752,000 from the sale of real estate
properties and available for sale securities,  $20,011,000 from collections from
real estate  loans and  $4,951,000  from an  increase in borrowed  funds and the
placement of a mortgage on a leasehold  interest.  These  funds,  in addition to
cash on hand,  were used primarily to fund real estate loans of $44,276,000  and
to make joint venture investments in the aggregate amount of $866,000.

     BRT will satisfy its liquidity needs in the year ending  September 30, 2002
from cash and cash  investments on hand, the credit facility with NFB,  interest
and principal  payments  received on outstanding  real estate loans and net cash
flow generated  from the operation and sale of real estate assets.  BRT also has
the  ability  to borrow on  margin,  using the  shares it owns in  Entertainment
Properties  Trust as collateral.  At September 30, 2001 there was  approximately
$3,000,000 available under this facility.





Results of Operations

2001 vs. 2000

     Interest  and fees on loans  increased  to  $8,685,000  for the year  ended
September 30, 2001 as compared to $ 6,205,000  for the year ended  September 30,
2000. The increase of $ 2,480,000 was primarily the result of an increase in the
average  balance of loans  outstanding  during the year. The average  balance of
loans  increased from $ 43,075,000 in fiscal 2000 to $ 54,208,000 in fiscal 2001
causing an increase in interest income of $ 1,386,000. During the current fiscal
year the Trust  received  $994,000 of  "additional  Interest"  and fees from the
payoff of two loans,  one of which was a participating  loan. In addition a loan
that was previously  non-performing  returned to performing status in 2001 and $
170,000 of delinquent  interest was received.  These  increases  were  partially
offset by a decline in the  interest  rate earned on the loan  portfolio  in the
current  fiscal  year.  The average  rate earned  declined 17 basis  points from
12.61% in the prior year to 12.44% in the current  year.  This  accounted  for a
$73,000 decline in interest income.

     Operating  income on real estate  assets,  which is composed  primarily  of
rental  income,  increased  $703,000  from  $948,000  in the  fiscal  year ended
September  30, 2000 to $ 1,651,000 in the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2001.
This increase is the result of rental income generated from a leasehold interest
purchased by a consolidated joint venture at the end of the prior fiscal year.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated  ventures increased in the fiscal year
ended  September  30,  2001 to $889,000  from  $626,000 in the fiscal year ended
September  30, 2000.  This  increase of $ 263,000 was  primarily the result of a
full year of operations by a joint venture  entered into at the end of the prior
fiscal year.

     Other revenues, which is primarily composed of investment income, increased
$473,000  from  $3,107,000  in the  fiscal  year  ended  September  30,  2000 to
$3,580,000  in the  current  fiscal  year.  During the  current  fiscal year BRT
received  $438,000 from a distribution on a residual interest held in a venture.
This residual  interest  resulted  from the sale of a partnership  interest in a
prior year. The average rate earned on invested assets increased 29 basis points
from 9.33% in the prior fiscal year to 9.62% in the current  fiscal year causing
an increase in interest  income of $93,000.  Offsetting  these  increases  was a
decline in the average balance of invested assets  outstanding  from $33,200,000
in the prior fiscal year to $32,700,000 in the current fiscal year.  This caused
a decline of $58,000 in interest income.

     Interest on notes and loans payable declined from $77,000 in the year ended
September 30, 2000 to $53,000 in the year ended September 30, 2001. This decline
of $24,000 is the result of a reduced  level of  borrowings  during the  current
fiscal year.

     The Advisor's fee,  which is calculated  pursuant to agreement and is based
on invested  assets,  increased  $179,000 in the fiscal year ended September 30,
2001 to $745,000  from  $566,000 in the fiscal year ended  September  30,  2000.
During  the  current  fiscal  year the Trust  experienced  a higher  outstanding
balance of invested assets thereby causing an increase in the fee.

     Other  taxes  increased  $51,000  to  $249,000  in the  fiscal  year  ended
September  30, 2001 from $ 198,000 in the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2000.
This  increase  is the result of an  increase in the amount of federal and state
alternative minimum tax paid in the current year.

     Expenses  related to  investment  income was $ 575,000  for the fiscal year
ended  September 30, 2001. The fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 contained no
such expenses. During the current year the Trust incurred legal, printing, proxy
solicitor fees and other expenses related to the solicitation of proxies to vote
in favor of BRT's nominee to the Board of Trustees of  Entertainment  Properties
Trust  (NYSE:EPR).  BRT owns 9.21% of the  outstanding  shares of  Entertainment
Properties Trust and is its largest shareholder.

     Operating  expenses  relating to real estate assets  declined $ 13,000 to $
925,000  for the  current  fiscal  year from $ 938,000 for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2000. In the current  fiscal year operating  expenses  increased $
420,000 primarily due to the purchase of a leasehold  interest at the end of the
prior fiscal year.  Offsetting  this  increase was a $ 466,000  decline in legal
expenses  relating to a property  that the Trust  acquired in  foreclosure  in a
prior fiscal year.  General operating  expenses on other properties  increased $
33,000 in the current fiscal year.

     Gain on the sale of real estate assets and foreclosed  properties increased
$123,000  in the fiscal  year  ended  September  30,  2001 to $  1,937,000  from
$1,814,000 in the fiscal year ended  September  30, 2000. In the current  fiscal
year  $1,431,000 of the gain resulted from the sale of a residual  interest in a
venture.  The  remaining  gain of $506,000  resulted from the sale of individual
cooperative  apartment units that were previously  acquired in foreclosure.  For
the prior fiscal year the Trust  recognized gains of $1,714,000 from the sale of
cooperative apartment units and $ 100,000 of miscellaneous gains.

     In the  fiscal  year  ended  September  30,  2001  the  Trust  recorded  an
extraordinary  expense of $ 264,000 on the early  extinguishment  of debt.  This
amount  represents the write off of unamortized  deferred fees associated with a
revolving credit line that was terminated during the current fiscal year.


2000 vs. 1999

     Interest  and fees on loans  decreased  to  $6,205,000  for the year  ended
September  30, 2000 as compared to $7,283,000  for the year ended  September 30,
1999.  The decrease of $1,078,000  was primarily the result of a decrease in the
average  balance of loans  outstanding  during the year. The average  balance of
loans declined from $51,036,000 in fiscal 1999 to $43,075,000  causing a decline
in interest income of $1,087,000.  During the current fiscal year two loans were
classified as non-accrual.  These loans caused an additional decline in interest
income of  $226,000.  These  declines  were offset by an increase in the average
interest rate earned on the loan portfolio.  The average  interest rate on loans
increased  65 basis  points from 14.27% in fiscal 1999 to 14.92% in fiscal 2000.
This accounted for an increase of $235,000 in interest income.

     Operating  income on real estate  assets,  which is composed  primarily  of
rental income, decreased $2,477,000 from $3,425,000 for the year ended September
30, 1999 to $948,000 for the year ended September 30, 2000. This decline was the
result of BRT's contribution of a property to a limited liability company at the
end of the prior fiscal year. This contribution  resulted in a decline in rental
income of $  2,557,000.  This  property  is now  accounted  for using the equity
method  of  accounting  and its  results  are no  longer  consolidated  with the
financial  statements  of the  Trust.  This  decline  was  offset by an  $80,000
increase in other rental revenues.

     The 1999  fiscal  year was  favorably  affected  by  revenues  of  $660,000
recognized from the recovery of previously  provided  allowances and write offs.
This was  related to a loan that paid off in full in fiscal  1999.  There was no
comparable revenue item in the current fiscal year.

     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated  ventures increased in the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2000 to $626,000, from a loss of $50,000 in the prior fiscal
year ended  September  30,  1999.  In the prior  fiscal year BRT  contributed  a
property to a limited  liability  company  which is now  accounted for using the
equity  method.  This  accounted  for $525,000 of the  increase.  The  remaining
increase  is due to  increased  rents of an  existing  joint  venture  and rents
received from joint ventures entered into during the current fiscal year.

     Other revenues, which is primarily composed of investment income, increased
$  2,252,000  from  $855,000  in the fiscal  year ended  September  30,  1999 to
$3,107,000 in the 2000 fiscal year.  The average  balance of cash and investable
funds increased by $14,424,000,  from $18,865,000 in the prior fiscal year, to $
33,289,000 in the 2000 fiscal year. This caused investment income to increase by
$955,000.  In addition,  the Trust invested a significant  portion of its excess
funds into higher  yielding REIT  securities and treasury  securities and out of
lower earning money market  funds.  The average rate earned on investable  funds
increased  633 basis points from 6.04% in the prior fiscal year to 12.37% in the
current  fiscal year.  This increase  accounted  for the  remaining  increase of
$1,279,000.

     Interest  expense on notes and loans  payable  decreased  by $343,000  from
$420,000  for the year ended  September  30,  1999 to $77,000 for the year ended
September  30,  2000.  This  decrease  was a  direct  result  of  lower  average
outstanding balances under the credit facility during 2000.

     General and  administrative  expenses decreased by $194,000 from $3,223,000
for the fiscal year ended  September 30, 1999 to $3,029,000  for the fiscal year
ended  September  30,  2000.  In the prior  year,  the Trust  incurred  costs in
connection  with  the  potential  acquisition  and/or  start  up of a  financial
institution. No similar expenses were incurred in the fiscal year.

     Other  taxes  decreased  $212,000  from  $386,000  in the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1999 to $174,000 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000. This
decline is the result of a decrease in the amount of federal alternative minimum
tax the Trust paid in the 2000 year.

     Operating expenses relating to real estate assets decreased to $938,000 for
the 2000 fiscal year from  $2,148,000  for the fiscal year ended  September  30,
1999. This decline of $1,210,000 was primarily the result of BRT  contributing a
property to a limited  liability  company  which is now  accounted for using the
equity method of accounting.  This  accounted for $1,724,000 of the  difference.
The  decline was offset by  $538,000  in legal and other  professional  expenses
incurred in  connection a litigation  related to a property sold by BRT in which
BRT is  involved  as a  defendant.  BRT was  granted  summary  judgment  in this
litigation and  reimbursement  of its legal fees. The amount of reimbursement of
legal fees is subject to ultimate determination by the Court and there can be no
estimate given as to the amount, if any, of such reimbursement.

     Gain on the sale of foreclosed properties declined in the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2000 to $1,814,000  from $5,719,000 in the prior fiscal year. This
decline of $3,905,000  was the result of a decline in the number of sales in the
current  fiscal year caused,  in large part, by the sale in prior fiscal year of
substantially all remaining foreclosed  properties.  During the 2000 fiscal year
BRT sold  cooperative  apartment units in two projects and recognized gains of $
1,714,000  In the 1999 fiscal year BRT sold several  properties  for a gain of $
3,973,000.  In the  1999  fiscal  year  the  Trust  also  recognized  a gain  of
$1,746,000 on the payoff in full of two loans that were previously  written off.
There was no such gain in the current  fiscal year. In the current  fiscal year,
the Trust also recognized miscellaneous gains totaling $ 100,000.

Outlook

     The real  estate  business  in general is  cyclical  and to a large  extent
depends  upon,  among other  factors,  national and local  business and economic
conditions,  government  economic policies and the level of interest rates. Most
economists  indicate that the national  economy has been in a recessionary  mode
for many months. In addition,  the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks have had
a negative  effect on the economy of New York City and  throughout  the country.
Notwithstanding  the difficult  national and local economies (which is projected
by some economists to be on the upswing in 2002) and the effect of the events of
September 11th, BRT to date has not experienced any material  adverse effects on
its business.  However,  a difficult or declining  real estate market in the New
York  metropolitan  area or in other parts of the country could potentially have
the  following  adverse  effects  on BRT's  business:  (i) an  increase  in loan
defaults which will result in decreased  interest and fees on real estate loans,
an increase  in loan loss  reserves  and an  increase  in  expenses  incurred in
foreclosures and restructurings; (ii) a decrease in loan originations; and (iii)
a decrease in rental income from properties owned by the Trust or joint ventures
in which BRT is a venture  participant  and an  increase in  operating  expenses
related to real estate properties.

     However,  a declining real estate market could also pose  opportunities for
BRT,  since in a declining  market  other  lenders,  particularly  institutional
lenders, become more conservative in their lending activities. If such a lending
environment occurs, the amount of potential business for BRT could increase.

     BRT's management is aware of the difficulties which could be encountered in
a declining  real estate  environment.  It  therefore  continually  monitors its
mortgage  portfolio for  compliance by its borrowers.  Management  also believes
that its loan  underwriting  policies will  ultimately  result in minimizing the
negative long-term effects of a declining real estate environment.

     Since approximately 77% of BRT's loan portfolio provides for stated minimum
or fixed interest rates, the current "low" interest rate  environment,  although
negatively  affecting BRT's revenues and net income,  has not had and should not
have a material adverse effect on revenues and net income.  BRT's loan portfolio
is to a large extent adjustable,  based on prime.  Accordingly,  any increase in
interest rates would have a positive effect on BRT's revenues and income.

Cash Distribution Policy

     BRT has  elected to be taxed as a real  estate  investment  trust under the
Internal  Revenue Code for more than eighteen years. To qualify as a real estate
investment  trust,  BRT must meet a number  of  organizational  and  operational
requirements,  including a requirement that it distribute currently at least 90%
of its adjusted taxable income to its shareholders.  It is management's  current
intention to comply with these requirements and maintain the Trust's real estate
investment trust status.  As a real estate  investment trust, BRT generally will
not be subject to corporate  federal income tax on taxable income it distributes
currently  (in  accordance  with  the  Internal   Revenue  Code  and  applicable
regulations)  to its  shareholders.  If BRT fails to  qualify  as a real  estate
investment trust in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes
at  regular  corporate  rates and may not be able to  qualify  as a real  estate
investment  trust for four  subsequent  tax  years.  Even if BRT  qualifies  for
federal taxation as a real estate investment trust, it may be subject to certain
state and local  taxes on its income and to federal  income and excise  taxes on
its undistributed  taxable income,  i.e.,  taxable income not distributed in the
amounts and in the time  frames  prescribed  by the  Internal  Revenue  Code and
applicable regulations thereunder.

     As a result of  accumulated  tax losses,  BRT was not required to make cash
distributions to shareholders to maintain its status as a real estate investment
trust for federal  income tax  purposes  until its  accumulated  tax losses were
fully used. The  accumulated tax losses were fully used during the 2001 calendar
year and BRT resumed the payment of cash  distributions  in July,  2001. For tax
purposes,  BRT is on a calendar  year  basis (as  distinguished  from  financial
reporting purposes for which it is on a September 30th fiscal year). Through the
date of this Form 10-K, BRT has paid cash  distributions at the rate of $.22 per
share per quarter totalling $3,226,000.  Including a cash distribution of $.24 a
share to be paid on January 3, 2002 to holders of record on December  21,  2001,
BRT will have paid  $4,992,000  for calendar  2001.  The Company  estimates  its
taxable  income  for  2001  will be  $9,631,000  after  the  utilization  of any
remaining net operating loss carryforwards,  of which  approximately  $1,945,000
represents capital gains income.

     It is BRT's  intention to pay to its  shareholders  within the time periods
prescribed  by the  Internal  Revenue  Code 100% of its annual  taxable  income,
excluding  gains from the sale of real  estate and  recognized  gains on sale of
available-for-sale  securities.  The Board of Trustees has not yet determined if
it will distribute capital gains income to its shareholders.

Item 7A - Market Risk Disclosure
          ----------------------

     BRT's primary component of market risk is interest rate sensitivity.  BRT's
interest  income and to a lesser  extent its  interest  expense  are  subject to
changes in  interest  rates.  BRT seeks to minimize  these risks by  originating
loans that are indexed to the prime rate,  with a stated minimum  interest rate,
and  borrowing,  when  necessary,  from its available  credit line which is also
indexed to the prime  rate.  At  September  30,  2001  approximately  65% of the
portfolio  was variable rate based  primarily on the prime rate.  Any changes in
the prime  interest  rate could have a positive  or  negative  effect on the net
interest income of BRT. When  determining  interest rate sensitivity BRT assumes
that any  change in  interest  rates is  immediate  and that the  interest  rate
sensitive assets and liabilities  existing at the beginning of the period remain
constant  over the period being  measured.  BRT has assessed the market risk for
its variable rate mortgage  receivables and variable rate debt and believes that
a one percent  increase in interest  rates would have  approximately  a $418,000
positive  effect on income  before  taxes and a one percent  decline in interest
rates  would have  approximately  a $134,000  negative  effect on income  before
taxes. In addition,  BRT originates  loans with short maturities and maintains a
strong  capital  position.  At  September  30,  2001  BRT's loan  portfolio  was
primarily secured by properties  located in the New York metropolitan  area, New
Jersey and  Connecticut  and in  Florida  and it is  therefore  subject to risks
associated with the economies of these localities.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS




To the Trustees and Shareholders
BRT Realty Trust


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BRT Realty Trust
and  Subsidiaries  (the  "Trust") as of  September  30,  2001 and 2000,  and the
related consolidated statements of income,  shareholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended  September 30, 2001.  Our audits
also  included the  financial  statement  schedules  listed in the Index at Item
14(a).  These financial  statements and schedules are the  responsibility of the
Trust's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an  opinion  on these
financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated   financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the consolidated  financial position of BRT Realty Trust
and Subsidiaries at September 30, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  September 30, 2001, in conformity with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States.  Also,  in our  opinion,  the related  financial
statement  schedules,  when  considered  in  relation  to  the  basic  financial
statements  taken  as a whole,  present  fairly  in all  material  respects  the
information set forth therein.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

                    (Amounts in Thousands Except Share Data)


NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation; Basis of Preparation

The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of BRT Realty Trust
and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  Investments  in less  than  majority-owned
entities have been accounted for using the equity method.  Material intercompany
items  and  transactions   have  been  eliminated.   Many  of  the  wholly-owned
subsidiaries were organized to take title to various properties  acquired by BRT
Realty Trust. BRT Realty Trust and its subsidiaries are hereinafter  referred to
as the "Trust".

Income Tax Status

The Trust qualifies as a real estate  investment trust under Sections 856-860 of
the Internal Revenue Code.

The  Trustees  may,  at their  option,  elect to operate the Trust as a business
trust not qualifying as a real estate investment trust.

Income Recognition

Income and  expenses are recorded on the accrual  basis of  accounting  for both
financial reporting and income tax purposes.  The Trust does not accrue interest
or rental income on impaired  loans or real estate owned where,  in the judgment
of management and the Trustees,  collection of interest or rent according to the
contractual terms is considered doubtful.  Among the factors the Trust considers
in making an evaluation  of the amount of interest or rent that are  collectable
are the status of the loan or property,  the financial condition of the borrower
or tenant and  anticipated  future  events.  The Trust  records cash receipts on
impaired  loans  using the  interest  income  method by directly  adjusting  the
recorded  investment leaving the valuation  constant  throughout the life of the
impaired loan. For impaired non-accrual loans,  interest is recognized on a cash
basis.  Loan discounts are amortized over the life of the real estate loan using
the constant interest method.

Loan commitment and extension fee income is deferred and recorded as income over
the  life  of  the   commitment   and  loan.   Commitment   fees  are  generally
non-refundable.  When a commitment  expires or the Trust no longer has any other
obligation to perform, the fee is recognized into income. If a loan subsequently
becomes  non-earning,  the unamortized  portion of the fee is offset against the
loan balance.

Rental  income  includes  the base rent that each  tenant is  required to pay in
accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line
basis over the initial term of the lease.

The basis on which the cost was  determined  in computing  the realized  gain or
loss on available-for-sale securities is historical cost.

Loans  held for sale are  carried  at lower of cost or  estimated  fair value as
determined  on an  aggregate  basis.  Deferred  fees on loans  held for sale are
recognized as a component of gain or loss upon the sale.  Gains or losses on the
sale are  determined  by the  difference  between  the  sales  proceeds  and the
carrying value of the loan.

Allowance for Possible Losses

The Trust  measures the  impairment of its real estate loans based upon the fair
value of the  underlying  collateral  which is determined on an individual  loan
basis.  In arriving at the fair value of the  collateral,  numerous  factors are
considered,   including,   market  evaluations  of  the  underlying  collateral,
operating cash flow from the property during the projected  holding period,  and
estimated  sales value computed by applying an expected  capitalization  rate to
the  stabilized  net  operating  income of the specific  property,  less selling
costs,   discounted  at  market  discount  rates.  If  upon  completion  of  the
valuations,  the underlying collateral securing the impaired real estate loan is
less than the recorded  investment  in the loan,  an allowance is created with a
corresponding charge to expense.

Real Estate Assets

Real estate  properties  is  comprised  of real  property in which the Trust has
invested  directly and  properties  acquired by  foreclosure  which are held for
sale.

When real estate is acquired by foreclosure or by a deed in lieu of foreclosure,
it is recorded at estimated fair value, net of foreclosure costs, at the time of
foreclosure.  In subsequent periods,  individual  foreclosed properties held for
sale are valued at the lower of the recorded  cost or estimated  fair value less
costs to sell, as described  below,  and if required,  a valuation  allowance is
recognized.  Assets  acquired  through  foreclosure  and held for sale,  are not
depreciated,  while  assets  held  long-term  for the  production  of income are
depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Costs incurred in connection with
the  foreclosure  of the  properties  collateralizing  the real estate loans and
costs  incurred  to  extend  the  life  or  improve  the  assets  subsequent  to
foreclosure are capitalized. With respect to the operating properties, operating
income and expenses are reflected in the statements of income.

The Trust  accounts  for the sale of real estate when title passes to the buyer,
sufficient  equity  payments  have been  received  and when there is  reasonable
assurance that the remaining receivable will be collected.

Investments  in joint  ventures  that the Trust does not own a greater  than 50%
interest  or in which it does not have the ability to  exercise  operational  or
financial control, are accounted for using the equity method.  Accordingly,  the
Trust reports its pro rata share of net profits and losses from its  investments
in   unconsolidated   entities  in  the  accompanying   consolidated   financial
statements.

Valuation Allowance on Real Estate Assets

The Trust reviews each real estate asset owned,  including  investments  in real
estate  ventures,  for which  indicators of impairment  are present to determine
whether  the  carrying  amount of the asset will be  recovered.  Recognition  of
impairment is required if the undiscounted  cash flows estimated to be generated
by the assets are less than the assets'  carrying  amount.  Measurement is based
upon the fair value of the asset. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at
the lower of cost or fair  value,  less costs to sell,  on an  individual  asset
basis.  Upon  evaluating the property,  many indicators of value are considered,
including current and expected  operating cash flow from the property during the
projected  holding  period,  costs  necessary  to extend the life or improve the
asset, expected capitalization rates, projected stabilized net operating income,
selling costs,  and the ability to hold and dispose of such real estate owned in
the ordinary course of business.  Valuation  adjustments may be necessary in the
event  that  effective   interest  rates,   rent-up  periods,   future  economic
conditions,  and other relevant factors vary significantly from those assumed in
valuing the property at the time of foreclosure. If future evaluations result in
a diminution in the value of the property, the reduction will be recognized as a
valuation allowance.  If the value of the property subsequently  increases,  the
valuation allowance will be reduced.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments:

Cash and cash  equivalents:  The carrying  amounts reported in the balance sheet
for these instruments approximate their fair values.

Available-for-sale   securities:   Investment  in  securities   are   considered
"available-for-sale",  and are  reported on the balance  sheet based upon quoted
market prices.

Real estate loans:  The earning mortgage loans of the Trust have either variable
interest rate  provisions,  which are based upon a margin over the prime, or are
currently  fixed at  effective  interest  rates  which  approximate  market.  At
September  30,  2001 and 2000 these  interest  rates are  reflective  of current
market  conditions  for these loans.  Accordingly,  the carrying  amounts of the
earning,  non-impaired mortgage loans approximate their fair values. For earning
loans  which are  impaired,  the Trust has valued such loans based upon the fair
value of the underlying  collateral.  Accordingly,  their  carrying  amounts are
recorded at fair value.

Notes  and  mortgages  payable:  There is no  material  difference  between  the
carrying  amounts and fair value  because  interest  rates  approximate  current
market rates.

Per Share Data

Basic  earnings per share was  determined  by dividing net income  applicable to
common  shareholders  for each year by the weighted  average number of Shares of
Beneficial  Interest  outstanding  during each year.  Diluted earnings per share
reflects  the  potential  dilution  that  could  occur  if  securities  or other
contracts to issue Shares of  Beneficial  Interest  were  exercised or converted
into Shares of  Beneficial  Interest  or  resulted in the  issuance of Shares of
Beneficial  Interest  that then shared in the earnings of the  Company.  Diluted
earnings per share was  determined  by dividing net income  applicable to common
shareholders for each year by the total of the weighted average number of Shares
of Beneficial  Interest  outstanding  plus the dilutive  effect of the Company's
outstanding options using the treasury stock method.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid  investments,  primarily direct United
States treasury  obligations and money market type U.S. Government  obligations,
with maturities of three months or less when purchased.

Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  conformity  with  accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.  requires management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results  could  differ from those
estimates.

Segment Reporting

Effective October 1, 1998, the Trust adopted the Financial  Accounting Standards
Board's Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 131,  Disclosure About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Statement 131 superceded FASB
Statement  No. 14 Financial  Reporting  for  Segments of a Business  Enterprise.
Statement  No.  131  establishes  standards  for the way  that  public  business
enterprises  report  information  about operating  segments in annual  financial
statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about
operating  segments  in  interim  financial  reports.  Statement  No.  131  also
establishes  standards  for related  disclosures  about  products and  services,
geographical  areas, and major customers.  The adoption of Statement No. 131 did
not affect  results of operations or financial  position.  As the Trust operates
predominantly  in one industry  segment,  has  determined it has one  reportable
segment and operates primarily in one geographic  location,  management believes
it is in compliance with the standards established by Statement No. 131.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The FASB issued  Statement No. 137,  Accounting for Derivative  Instruments  and
Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133. The
Statement  deferred for one year the effective  date of FASB  Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities.  The rule applies
to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  Because of the Company's minimal
use of derivatives,  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new
statement will have a significant  effect on earnings or the financial  position
of the Company.

reclassification

Certain amounts reported in previous financial statements have been reclassified
in the  accompanying  financial  statements  to  conform to the  current  year's
presentation.

</TABLE>

The real estate loan not earning  interest at September  30, 2001 was not deemed
impaired,  as it is probable  that the Trust will be able to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual  terms. At September 30, 2000,  $3,250 of loans
were  non-earning  and deemed  impaired  because it was probable  that the Trust
would not be able to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms. During
the current year one of the loans with a net balance of $2,835 was  restructured
and all past due  interest  has been paid.  A second  loan with a net balance of
$415 is no longer considered  impaired as BRT expects to collect all amounts due
under the contractual terms.  Subsequently,  no allowance for possible losses is
being  provided  for this loan.  Of the real estate  loans  earning  interest at
September  30,  2001 and 2000,  $6,579 and  $1,418,  respectively,  were  deemed
impaired and all are subject to allowances  for possible  losses.  For the years
ended  September  30, 2001,  2000 and 1999,  respectively,  an average  $11,025,
$4,482 and $4,893 of real estate loans were deemed  impaired,  on which  $1,310,
$255 and $520 of interest income was recognized.

Loans  originated by the Trust generally  provide for interest rates,  which are
indexed to the prime rate. The weighted  average  interest rate on earning loans
was 11.75% and 13.56% at September 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Included in real estate  loans are three  second  mortgages to ventures in which
the Trust (through wholly owned subsidiaries) holds a 50% interest. At September
30, 2001 and  September 30, 2000,  the balance of the mortgage  loans was $3,425
and $850,  respectively.  Interest  received on these loans totaled $187 and $40
for the year ended September 30, 2001 and September 30, 2000, respectively.

Annual maturities of real estate loans receivable before allowances for possible
losses during the next five years and thereafter  reflect revised maturities and
are summarized as follows:

     Years Ending September 30                                     Amount

     Total............................................            $ 67,928
                                                                  ========

The Trust's  portfolio  consists  primarily of senior and junior mortgage loans,
secured by residential and commercial property,  42% of which are located in the
New York metropolitan  area (which includes New Jersey and Connecticut),  21% in
Florida, 18% in California and 9.5% in Georgia.

If a loan is not repaid at maturity, in addition to foreclosing on the property,
the Trust may either  extend the loan or consider  the loan past due.  The Trust
analyzes each loan separately to determine the  appropriateness of an extension.
In  analyzing  each  situation,  management  examines  many  aspects of the loan
receivable, including the value of the collateral, the financial strength of the
borrower,  past payment  history and plans of the owner of the property.  Of the
$46,031 of real estate loans receivable which mature in Fiscal 2002, $8,599 were
extended during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001.

If  all  loans   classified  as  non-earning  were  earning  interest  at  their
contractual  rates for the year  ended  September  30,  2001 and 2000,  interest
income would have increased by $46 and $226, respectively.

The Trust's  interests in wraparound  mortgages of $8,950 and $8,850 are subject
to  underlying  mortgages  aggregating  $7,500 at both at September 30, 2001 and
2000 respectively. Interest income earned on these loans was $1,012 and $433 for
the years ended  September  30, 2001 and 2000,  respectively,  of which $686 and
$281 was paid to the holder of the prior mortgage loan.

At September 30, 2001 the three largest real estate loans had principal balances
outstanding of approximately $12,000,  $7,800 and $5,350,  respectively.  Of the
total interest and fees earned on real estate loans during the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2001, 3.2%, 9.3% and 3.0% related to these loans, respectively.

NOTE 7  - INCOME TAXES

The Trust has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT),  as
defined under the Internal  Revenue Code. As a REIT the Trust will generally not
be subject to Federal  income taxes at the corporate  level if it distributes at
least 90% of its REIT taxable income, as defined, to its shareholders. There are
a number  organizational  and  operational  requirements  the Trust must meet to
remain a REIT. If the Trust fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year,  its
taxable income will be subject to Federal income tax at the corporate  rates and
it may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four  subsequent tax years.  Even if
it is qualified as a REIT,  the Trust may be subject to certain  state and local
income taxes and to Federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable
income.

At December 31, 2000, the Trust had available net operating  loss  carryforwards
of $936 of which,  $338 will  expire in 2009,  $527 will  expire in 2010 and $71
will expire in 2011. As of September 30, 2001 all of the remaining tax operating
loss caryforwards have been utilitzed.

During the years ended  September 30, 2001 and 2000 the Trust  recorded $249 and
$198, respectively,  of expense of which $187 and $174 related to the payment of
alternative  minimum tax. The Trust was required to pay alternative  minimum tax
related to the usage of the net operating loss carryforwards.

Earnings  and  profits,   which   determine  the   taxability  of  dividends  to
shareholders,  differ than net income reported for financial  statement purposes
due to various items among which are timing differences  related to depreciation
methods and carrying values.

The taxable  income is expected  to be $598 lower than the  financial  statement
income during calendar 2001.

NOTE 8 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

Distributions

In July 2001 the Trust  commenced  paying a  dividend  to  holders  of shares of
beneficial  interest.  There  were no  distributions  on the  Trust's  shares of
beneficial interest declared during the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999.

Stock Options

On December 8, 1995, the Board of Trustees granted,  under the 1988 Stock Option
Plan  (Incentive/Nonstatutory  Stock  Option  Plan),  options  to  purchase  the
remaining  53,000 shares of  beneficial  interest  available  under this plan at
$4.375 per share to various officers and employees of the Trust. The options are
cumulatively  exercisable at a rate of 25% per annum, for a period of five years
commencing  six  months  after the date of grant.  During the  current  year the
remaining 43,000 of the options were exercised.  At September 30, 2001 there are
no remaining options under the Plan.

On December 6, 1996,  the Board of  Trustees  adopted the BRT 1996 Stock  Option
Plan  (Incentive/Nonstatutory  Stock Option Plan),  whereby a maximum of 450,000
shares of beneficial interest are reserved for issuance to the Trust's officers,
employees,  trustees and  consultants or advisors to the Trust.  Incentive stock
options are granted at per share amounts at least equal to the fair value at the
date of grant, whereas for nonstatutory stock options, the exercise price may be
any amount determined by the Board, but not less than the par value of a share.

Also on December 6, 1996,  the Board of Trustees  granted,  under the 1996 Stock
Option Plan options to purchase a total of 82,500 shares of beneficial  interest
at $6.00 per share to a number of officers,  employees  and  consultants  to the
Trust.  The options  are  cumulatively  exercisable  at a rate of 25% per annum,
commencing  after six  months,  and expire  five years  after the date of grant.
During the current year 62,000 of the options were  exercised.  At September 30,
2001 options to purchase 15,500 shares are exercisable,  none of which have been
exercised.

In March and April  1998 the Board of  Trustees  granted,  under the 1996  Stock
Option Plan options to purchase  50,000 shares of beneficial  interest at prices
ranging from $7.3125 to $7.9375 per share to a number of directors, officers and
employees of the Trust.  The options are  cumulatively  exercisable at a rate of
25% per annum,  commencing after two years, and expire ten years after the grant
date. During the current year 20,000 of the options were exercised. At September
30, 2001 none of the remaining options are exercisable.

In December  1998 the Board of  Directors  granted,  under the 1996 Stock Option
Plan options to purchase  180,000  shares of beneficial  interest at $5.9375 per
share to a number of officers, employees, consultants and trustees of the Trust.
The options are cumulatively  exercisable at a rate of 25% per annum, commencing
after one year (50,000) and two years (130,000),  and expire five years (50,000)
and ten years  (130,000)  after the date of the grant.  During the current  year
40,625 of the options  were  exercised.  At  September  30, 2000 12,500 of these
options were  exercisable,  none of which were exercised.  At September 30, 2001
options  to  purchase  13,625  shares are  exercisable,  none of which have been
exercised.

In December 2000 the Board of Directors granted under the 1996 Stock Option Plan
options to purchase 165,500 shares of beneficial  interest at $7.75 per share to
a number of officers,  employees and  consultants of the Trust.  The options are
cumulatively  exercisable at a rate of 25% per annum, commencing after two years
and expire ten years after grant date.  At September 30, 2001 none of these were
exercisable.

The Trust elected  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees ("APB 25"), and related  Interpretations in accounting
for its  employee  stock  options.  Under APB 25,  no  compensation  expense  is
recognized  because the exercise  price of the Trust's  employee  stock  options
equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
FAS No.  123,  and has been  determined  as if the Trust had  accounted  for its
employee  stock options  under the fair value  method.  The fair value for these
options was  estimated at the date of the grant using the  Black-Scholes  option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

</TABLE>

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded  options which have no vesting  restrictions  and are fully
transferable.  In addition,  option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective  assumptions  including expected stock price volatility.  Because the
Trust's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from
those of traded  options,  and changes in the subjective  input  assumptions can
materially  affect the fair value  estimate,  management  believes  the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of
its employee stock options.
