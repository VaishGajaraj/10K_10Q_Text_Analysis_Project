Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Forward-looking  statements  have been made in this  document,  and in documents
that are incorporated by reference, that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
These forward-looking statements describe future plans or strategies and include
Associated Banc-Corp's  expectations of future results of operations.  The words
"believes,"   "expects,"   "anticipates,"   or  similar   expressions   identify
forward-looking statements.

Shareholders  should  note  that  many  factors,  some of  which  are  discussed
elsewhere  in this  document  and in the  documents  that  are  incorporated  by
reference, could affect the future financial results of Associated Banc-Corp and
could  cause  those  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  in
forward-looking  statements  contained  or  incorporated  by  reference  in this
document. These factors include the following:

-    operating, legal, and regulatory risks;

-    economic,   political,   and  competitive   forces   affecting   Associated
     Banc-Corp's  banking,  securities,  asset  management,  and credit services
     businesses; and

-    the risk that  Associated  Banc-Corp's  analyses  of these risks and forces
     could be  incorrect  and/or that the  strategies  developed to address them
     could be unsuccessful.

These factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements,
and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Associated Banc-Corp
undertakes  no obligation  to update or revise any forward  looking  statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

                                     PART I

ITEM 1       BUSINESS

General

Associated  Banc-Corp (the  "Corporation") is a bank holding company  registered
pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act"). It was
incorporated  in Wisconsin in 1964 and was inactive  until 1969 when  permission
was  received  from the Board of  Governors  of the  Federal  Reserve  System to
acquire three banks. At December 31, 2001, the Corporation owned four commercial
banks located in Illinois,  Minnesota,  and Wisconsin (the "affiliates") serving
their local communities and, measured by total assets held at December 31, 2001,
was  the  second  largest  commercial  bank  holding  company  headquartered  in
Wisconsin.  The Corporation also owned 18 limited purpose banking and nonbanking
subsidiaries  (the  "subsidiaries")  located in Arizona,  California,  Illinois,
Nevada, and Wisconsin.

Services

The Corporation  provides  advice and specialized  services to its affiliates in
banking   policy  and   operations,   including   auditing,   data   processing,
marketing/advertising,  investing,  legal/compliance,  personnel services, trust
services,  risk  management,   facilities  management,   security,   purchasing,
treasury, finance, accounting, and other financial services functionally related
to banking.

Responsibility   for  the  management  of  the  affiliates  remains  with  their
respective Boards of Directors and officers. Services rendered to the affiliates
by the  Corporation  are  intended  to  assist  the  local  management  of these
affiliates to expand the scope of services  offered by them.  Bank affiliates of
the Corporation at December 31, 2001, provided services through 208 locations in
145 communities.

The  Corporation,  through its affiliates,  provides a complete range of banking
services  to  individuals  and  businesses.  These  services  include  checking,
savings,  and money market deposit accounts,  business,  personal,  educational,
residential,  and commercial mortgage loans, other  consumer-oriented  financial
services,  including IRA and Keogh  accounts,  lease  financing for a variety of
capital  equipment  for  commerce  and  industry,  and safe  deposit  and  night
depository  facilities.  Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), which provide 24-hour
banking services to customers of the affiliates, are installed in many locations
in the  affiliates'  service areas.  The affiliates are members of an interstate
shared ATM network, which allows their customers to perform

                                       3
<PAGE>

banking  transactions from their checking,  savings,  or credit card accounts at
ATMs in a multi-state  environment.  Among the services designed specifically to
meet the needs of businesses  are various types of specialized  financing,  cash
management services, and transfer/collection facilities.

The affiliates  provide lending,  depository,  and related financial services to
individual,  commercial, industrial, financial, and governmental customers. Term
loans, revolving credit arrangements,  letters of credit, inventory and accounts
receivable  financing,  real  estate  construction  lending,  and  international
banking services are available.

Lending  involves credit risk.  Credit risk is controlled and monitored  through
active  asset  quality  management  and the use of lending  standards,  thorough
review of potential borrowers,  and active asset quality administration.  Active
asset quality  administration,  including early problem loan  identification and
timely resolution of problems,  further ensures appropriate management of credit
risk and minimization of loan losses.  The allowance for loan losses  represents
management's  estimate  of an amount  adequate to provide  for  probable  losses
inherent in the loan portfolio.  Management's  evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses is based on management's ongoing review and grading of
the loan portfolio,  consideration of past loan loss experience,  trends in past
due and nonperforming loans, risk characteristics of the various classifications
of loans, current economic conditions,  the fair value of underlying collateral,
and other  factors  which could  affect  potential  credit  losses.  Credit risk
management is discussed under sections "Loans," "Allowance for Loan Losses," and
"Nonperforming Loans, Potential Problem Loans, and Other Real Estate Owned," and
under Notes 1 and 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Additional  emphasis is given to noncredit  services for  commercial  customers,
such as advice and  assistance in the placement of  securities,  corporate  cash
management,   and  financial  planning.  The  affiliates  make  available  check
clearing, safekeeping, loan participations, lines of credit, portfolio analyses,
and other services to approximately 120 correspondent financial institutions.

A trust company subsidiary and an investment  management subsidiary offer a wide
variety of fiduciary,  investment  management,  advisory,  and corporate  agency
services to  individuals,  corporations,  charitable  trusts,  foundations,  and
institutional investors. They also administer (as trustee and in other fiduciary
and  representative  capacities)  pension,  profit  sharing  and other  employee
benefit plans, and personal trusts and estates.

Investment  subsidiaries  provide discount and full-service  brokerage services,
including  the  sale  of  fixed  and  variable  annuities,   mutual  funds,  and
securities,  to the  affiliates'  customers  and the general  public.  Insurance
subsidiaries  provide commercial and individual insurance services and engage in
reinsurance.  Various life, property,  casualty,  credit, and mortgage insurance
products are available to the affiliates'  customers and the general public. Two
investment  subsidiaries located in Nevada hold, manage, and trade cash, stocks,
and securities  transferred from the affiliates and reinvest  investment income.
Three additional investment  subsidiaries formed in Nevada and headquartered and
domiciled in the Cayman  Islands  provide  investment  services for their parent
bank, as well as provide  management of their respective Real Estate  Investment
Trust  ("REIT")  subsidiaries.  An  appraisal  subsidiary  provides  real estate
appraisals for customers, government agencies, and the general public.

The mortgage banking subsidiary is involved in the origination,  servicing,  and
warehousing  of mortgage  loans,  and the sale of such loans to  investors.  The
primary focus is on one- to four-family residential and multi-family properties,
which are generally  salable into the secondary  mortgage market.  The principal
mortgage  lending  areas  of  this  subsidiary  are  Wisconsin,  Minnesota,  and
Illinois. Nearly all long-term,  fixed-rate real estate mortgage loans generated
are sold in the secondary market and to other financial  institutions,  with the
subsidiary retaining the servicing of those loans.

In addition to real estate loans, the Corporation's  affiliates and subsidiaries
originate and/or service consumer loans, business credit card loans, and student
loans.  Consumer,  home equity,  and student lending  activities are principally
conducted in Wisconsin  and  Illinois,  while the credit card base and resulting
loans are  principally  centered in the Midwest.  In April 2000, the Corporation
entered  into  an  agreement  with  Citibank  USA  for  the  acquisition  of the
Corporation's  retail  credit  card  portfolio.  That  agreement,  along  with a
five-year agency

                                       4

<PAGE>

agreement entered into  contemporaneously  with Citibank USA, provides for agent
fees and other income on new and existing card business.

The  Corporation,  its  affiliates,  and  subsidiaries  are not dependent upon a
single or a few  customers,  the loss of which  would  have a  material  adverse
effect  on  the  Corporation.  No  material  portion  of  the  business  of  the
Corporation, its affiliates, or its subsidiaries is seasonal.

Foreign Operations

The  Corporation,  its  affiliates,  and  subsidiaries  do  not  engage  in  any
operations in foreign  countries,  other than three investment  subsidiaries all
formed  under  the  General  Corporation  Law  of the  State  of  Nevada.  These
investment  subsidiaries are  headquartered  and  commercially  domiciled in the
Cayman  Islands.  Each subsidiary has at least one employee who is a resident of
the Cayman  Islands.  In addition,  Associated  Bank,  National  Association,  a
banking  affiliate of the  Corporation,  has  established a branch in the Cayman
Islands under a Class B Banking  License issued by the Cayman  Islands  Monetary
Authority. It has at least one employee who is a resident of the Cayman Islands.

Employees

At December 31, 2001, the Corporation,  its affiliates,  and subsidiaries,  as a
group, had 3,845 full-time equivalent employees.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive.  The Corporation competes
for loans, deposits, and financial services in all of its principal markets. The
Corporation  competes directly with other bank and nonbank  institutions located
within its markets,  with  out-of-market  banks and bank holding  companies that
advertise or otherwise serve the Corporation's  markets,  money market and other
mutual  funds,  brokerage  houses,  and various  other  financial  institutions.
Additionally,   the  Corporation  competes  with  insurance  companies,  leasing
companies, regulated small loan companies, credit unions, governmental agencies,
and  commercial  entities  offering  financial  services  products.  Competition
involves efforts to obtain new deposits, the scope and type of services offered,
interest  rates paid on deposits and charged on loans,  as well as other aspects
of banking.  All of the affiliates also face direct  competition from members of
bank holding  company  systems that have greater assets and resources than those
of the Corporation.

Supervision and Regulation

Financial institutions are highly regulated both at the federal and state level.
Numerous  statutes  and  regulations   presently  affect  the  business  of  the
Corporation,  its  affiliates,  and  its  subsidiaries.  Proposed  comprehensive
statutory  and  regulatory  changes  could  have an effect on the  Corporation's
business.

As a registered  bank holding  company  under the Act, the  Corporation  and its
nonbanking  affiliates are regulated and supervised by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (the "Board"). The affiliates of the Corporation with
a national  charter  are  supervised  and  examined  by the  Comptroller  of the
Currency.  The  affiliates  with a state charter are  supervised and examined by
their  respective  state banking agency,  and by the Federal  Deposit  Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC").  All affiliates of the Corporation that accept insured
deposits are subject to examination by the FDIC.

The activities of the Corporation, its affiliates, and subsidiaries, are limited
by the Act to those activities that are banking or those  nonbanking  activities
that are closely  related or incidental to banking.  The Corporation is required
to act as a source of financial  strength to each of its affiliates  pursuant to
which  it  may be  required  to  commit  financial  resources  to  support  such
affiliates in circumstances when, absent such requirements,  it might not do so.
The Act also  requires the prior  approval of the Board for the  Corporation  to
acquire  direct or  indirect  control of more than five  percent of any class of
voting shares of any bank or bank holding company.  Further restrictions imposed
by the Act include  capital  requirements,  restrictions  on  transactions  with

                                       5

<PAGE>

affiliates, on issuances of securities, on dividend payments, on inter-affiliate
liabilities,  on  extensions  of credit,  and on  expansion  through  merger and
acquisition.

The  federal  regulatory   authorities  have  broad  authority  to  enforce  the
regulatory  requirements  imposed  on  the  Corporation,   its  affiliates,  and
subsidiaries.  In particular,  the Financial  Institutions Reform,  Recovery and
Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"),  and their implementing  regulations,  carry
greater enforcement  powers.  Under FIRREA, all commonly controlled FDIC insured
depository  institutions  may be held  liable for any loss  incurred by the FDIC
resulting  from a  failure  of,  or any  assistance  given by the  FDIC to,  any
commonly controlled  institutions.  Pursuant to certain provisions under FDICIA,
the federal  regulatory  agencies  have broad  powers to take prompt  corrective
action if a depository  institution  fails to maintain  certain  capital levels.
Prompt  corrective  action may include the inability of the  Corporation  to pay
dividends,  restrictions  in  acquisitions  or activities,  limitations on asset
growth, and other restrictions.

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 contains
provisions  which  amended  the  Act  to  allow  an  adequately-capitalized  and
adequately-managed  bank  holding  company to acquire a bank  located in another
state as of

September 29, 1995. Effective June 1, 1997, interstate branching was
permitted. The Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997 clarifies the applicability of
host state laws to any branch in such state of an out-of-state bank.

The FDIC  maintains the Bank  Insurance  Fund (BIF) and the Savings  Association
Insurance Fund (SAIF) by assessing depository  institutions an insurance premium
twice a year.  The amount  each  institution  is  assessed  is based both on the
balance of insured  deposits held during the preceding two quarters,  as well as
on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund. FDIC assesses
higher  rates on those  institutions  that pose greater  risks to the  insurance
funds. Effective April 1, 2000, the FDIC Board of Directors (FDIC Board) adopted
revisions to the FDIC's regulation governing deposit insurance assessments which
it believes enhance the present system by allowing  institutions  with improving
capital  positions to benefit from the improvement  more quickly while requiring
those whose capital is failing to pay a higher  assessment  sooner.  The Federal
Deposit  Insurance  Act governs the  authority  of the FDIC Board to set BIF and
SAIF  assessment  rates and  directs the FDIC Board to  establish  a  risk-based
assessment system for insured depository institutions and set assessments to the
extent necessary to maintain the reserve ratio at 1.25%.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, P.L. 106-102,  enacted on November 12, 1999,
has made major amendments to the Act. The amendments,  among other things, allow
certain  qualifying  bank  holding  companies to engage in  activities  that are
financial in nature and that  explicitly  include the  underwriting  and sale of
insurance.  The amendments also amend the Act provisions governing the scope and
manner of the Board's supervision of bank holding companies, the manner in which
activities may be found to be financial in nature, and the extent to which state
laws on  insurance  will  apply  to  insurance  activities  of  banks  and  bank
affiliates.  The Board has issued regulations implementing these provisions. The
amendments  allow for the expansion of activities by banking  organizations  and
permit consolidation among financial organizations generally.

The  laws  and  regulations  to  which  the  Corporation,  its  affiliates,  and
subsidiaries  are subject are constantly  under review by Congress,  the federal
regulatory agencies, and the state authorities. These laws and regulations could
be changed  drastically in the future,  which could affect the  profitability of
the Corporation,  its ability to compete effectively,  or the composition of the
financial services industry in which the Corporation competes.

Government Monetary Policies and Economic Controls

The  earnings  and growth of the  banking  industry  and the  affiliates  of the
Corporation  are  affected  by the  credit  policies  of  monetary  authorities,
including  the Federal  Reserve  System.  An  important  function of the Federal
Reserve  System is to regulate  the  national  supply of bank credit in order to
combat  recession and curb  inflationary  pressures.  Among the  instruments  of
monetary policy used by the Federal  Reserve to implement  these  objectives are
open  market  operations  in U.S.  government  securities,  changes  in  reserve
requirements  against member bank deposits,  and changes in the Federal  Reserve
discount rate. These means are used in

                                       6

<PAGE>

varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments, and
deposits,  and may  also  affect  interest  rates  charged  on loans or paid for
deposits.  The monetary  policies of the Federal Reserve  authorities have had a
significant  effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and
are expected to continue to have such an effect in the future.

In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets,
as well as the effect of credit  policies  by monetary  and fiscal  authorities,
including the Federal Reserve  System,  no prediction can be made as to possible
future changes in interest  rates,  deposit  levels,  and loan demand,  or their
effect on the business and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates.

ITEM 2       PROPERTIES

The  Corporation's  headquarters  are  located in the  Village  of  Ashwaubenon,
Wisconsin,  in a leased facility with approximately 30,000 square feet of office
space. The space is subject to a five-year lease with two consecutive  five-year
extensions.

At December  31, 2001,  the  affiliates  occupied  208 offices in 145  different
communities  within  Illinois,  Minnesota,  and  Wisconsin.  The main  office of
Associated Bank, National  Association,  is owned. The affiliate main offices in
downtown  Chicago,  Rockford,  and  Minneapolis  are  located in the  lobbies of
multi-story  office  buildings.  Most affiliate branch offices are free-standing
buildings that provide adequate customer parking,  including drive-in facilities
of various numbers and types for customer convenience. Some affiliates also have
branch  offices  in  various  supermarket  locations,  as  well  as  offices  in
retirement  communities.  In addition,  the Corporation owns other real property
that,  when  considered  in the  aggregate,  is not  material  to its  financial
position.

ITEM 3       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

There are legal proceedings  pending against certain affiliates and subsidiaries
of the Corporation which arose in the normal course of their business.  Although
litigation  is subject to many  uncertainties  and the  ultimate  exposure  with
respect to these matters cannot be ascertained,  management believes, based upon
discussions with counsel, that the Corporation has meritorious defenses, and any
ultimate  liability would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position or results of operations of the Corporation.

ITEM 4       SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no matters  submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2001.

ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion is management's analysis to assist in the understanding
and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations
of Associated Banc-Corp (the "parent company"), together with its affiliates and
subsidiaries  (the  "Corporation").  It should be read in  conjunction  with the
consolidated  financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data
presented elsewhere in this report.

During  2001,  the  Corporation  merged  all of the  Wisconsin  bank  affiliates
(Associated  Bank  South  Central,   Associated  Bank  North,   Associated  Bank
Milwaukee,  Associated Bank,  National  Association,  Associated Bank Lakeshore,
National Association,  and Associated Bank Green Bay, National Association) into
a single national banking charter,  headquartered in Green Bay, Wisconsin, under
the name Associated Bank,  National  Association.  Certain nonbank  subsidiaries
(Associated Leasing,  Inc., Associated Banc-Corp Services,  Inc., and Associated
Commercial  Mortgage,  Inc.)  also  merged  with and into  the  resultant  bank,
becoming operating divisions of Associated Bank, National Association.

The  financial   discussion  that  follows  may  refer  to  the  impact  of  the
Corporation's  business combination  activity,  detailed under section "Business
Combinations" and Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.  The
detailed  financial  discussion  focuses  on  2001  results  compared  to  2000.
Discussion of 2000 results to 1999 is predominantly in section "2000 Compared to
1999."

Performance Summary

The  Corporation  recorded  net  income of  $179.5  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2001, an increase of $11.5 million or 6.9% over the $168.0  million
earned in 2000.  Basic  earnings per share for 2001 were $2.72, a 10.6% increase
over 2000 basic  earnings per share of $2.46.  Earnings  per diluted  share were
$2.70, a 9.8% increase over 2000 diluted earnings per share of $2.46.  Return on
average  assets ("ROA") and return on average equity ("ROE") for 2001 were 1.37%
and 17.31%, respectively,  compared to 1.31% and 18.26%, respectively, for 2000.
Cash dividends paid in 2001 increased by 10.2% to $1.22 per share over the $1.11
per share paid in 2000. Key factors behind these results were:

-    Taxable  equivalent net interest income was $444.2 million for 2001,  $38.9
     million or 9.6%  higher  than 2000.  Interest  expense  decreased  by $88.9
     million,  while taxable equivalent interest income decreased $50.0 million.
     The  volume of  average  earning  assets  increased  $225  million to $12.3
     billion,  which  exceeded the $81.7  million  increase in  interest-bearing
     liabilities. Increases in the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing
     liabilities,  as well as changes in product  mix,  added  $18.3  million to
     taxable  equivalent  net interest  income,  while changes in interest rates
     resulted in a $20.6 million increase.

-    Net interest  income and net interest  margin were also impacted in 2001 by
     the declining  interest rate environment,  competitive  pricing  pressures,
     branch deposit sales, and funding of stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve
     lowered interest rates an unprecedented eleven times during 2001, producing
     an average  Federal  funds rate for 2001 that was 238 basis  points  ("bp")
     lower than the average for 2000.

-    The net interest margin was 3.62% for 2001, a 26 bp increase from 3.36% for
     2000, the net result of the 31 bp increase in interest rate spread,  offset
     by  a  5  bp  decline  in  the  net  free  funds  contribution.   Rates  on
     interest-bearing liabilities in 2001 were 86 bp lower than last year, while
     the yield on interest earning assets decreased 55 bp, bringing the interest
     rate spread up by 31 bp.

-    Total loans were $9.0  billion at December  31,  2001,  an increase of $106
     million or 1.2% over  December 31, 2000.  The loan mix  continued to shift,
     with  commercial   loan  balances   increasing  $603  million  (13.0%)  and
     representing  58% of total loans at December 31,  2001,  compared to 52% at
     year-end 2000.  Total deposits were $8.6 billion at December 31, 2001, $679
     million lower than December 31, 2000,  with brokered CDs decreasing by $626
     million.  To take advantage of the lower rate environment,  the Corporation
     increased  long-term  debt by  $1.0  billion,  including  $200  million  of
     subordinated debt, $200 million of bank notes, and longer-term Federal Home
     Loan Bank advances.

-    Asset quality  remained  relatively  strong.  The provision for loan losses
     increased to $28.2 million  compared to $20.2  million in 2000.  Net charge
     offs were $20.2 million, an increase of $11.3 million, primarily due to the
     charge off of several large commercial credits.  Net charge offs were 0.22%
     of average loans compared to 0.10% in 2000. The ratio of allowance for loan
     losses  to loans  was  1.42%  and  1.35% at  December  31,  2001 and  2000,
     respectively. Nonperforming loans were $52.1 million, representing 0.58% of
     total loans at year-end  2001,  compared to $47.7 million or 0.54% of total
     loans last year.

-    Noninterest  income  was $195.6  million  for 2001,  $11.4  million or 6.2%
     higher  than  2000.  Net  gains  on the  sales  of  assets  and  investment
     securities  totaled  $2.7  million in 2001,  compared to net gains of $16.8
     million in 2000.  Excluding  these asset and  security  sales,  noninterest
     income was $192.9  million,  or $25.5 million  (15.2%) over 2000.  Mortgage
     banking  revenue more than  doubled,  adding  $33.8  million over the prior
     year,  and service  charges on deposit  accounts  were up $4.5 million over
     2000.  Partially  offsetting these increases were an $8.6 million reduction
     in trust service fees and a $3.3 million decrease in retail commissions.

-    Noninterest expense was $338.4 million, up $20.6 million or 6.5% over 2000.
     Personnel   expenses  rose  $14.4  million,   of  which  $6.7  million  was
     attributable  to salary  expense and $7.7 million was due to fringe benefit
     expense.   Mortgage  servicing  rights  expense  increased  $10.6  million,
     predominantly  driven by an increase to the  valuation  reserve on mortgage
     servicing  rights.  All other expense  categories were down, in total, $4.4
     million.

-    Income tax expense  increased to $71.5 million,  up $9.6 million from 2000.
     The  effective tax rate in 2001 was 28.5%  compared to 26.9% for 2000.  The
     increase was  primarily  attributable  to the increase in net income before
     tax,  an  increase in state tax  expense,  and a decrease in tax  valuation
     allowance adjustments.

Business Combinations

There  were  no  business  combinations  during  2001  or  2000.  There  was one
transaction  pending at December 31,  2001,  which was  consummated  in February
2002,  as noted  below.  There  were  three  business  combination  transactions
completed  during  1999.  The  Corporation's  business  combination  activity is
further summarized in Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

On September  10, 2001,  the  Corporation  announced the signing of a definitive
agreement to acquire Signal Financial Corporation ("Signal") of Mendota Heights,
Minnesota.  Based upon the  Corporation's  closing  stock price on September 10,
2001 (the date of public announcement of the acquisition) and other terms of the
Merger  Agreement,  the acquisition  price is approximately  $192.5 million,  of
which, $58.4 million will be paid in cash and the remainder in the Corporation's
common stock. On February 28, 2002, the Corporation  consummated its acquisition
of 100% of the  outstanding  common  shares of Signal.  As the  transaction  was
accounted  for under the purchase  method,  the results of  operations of Signal
will be included by the  Corporation  beginning on the  consummation  date,  and
therefore,   are  not  included  in  the  accompanying   consolidated  financial
statements. At February 28, 2002, Signal reported $1.2 billion in total assets.

INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income

Net interest  income is the primary  source of the  Corporation's  revenue.  Net
interest income is the difference  between  interest income on interest  earning
assets,   such  as  loans  and   securities,   and  the   interest   expense  on
interest-bearing  deposits  and other  borrowings,  used to fund those and other
assets or activities.  The amount of net interest  income is affected by changes
in interest rates and by the amount and  composition of interest  earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities.  Additionally, net interest income is impacted
by the  sensitivity  of the  balance  sheet to changes in  interest  rates which
factors in characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial
instruments, contractual maturities, and repricing frequencies.

                                       12

<PAGE>

Net interest income in the consolidated statements of income (which excludes the
taxable equivalent adjustment on tax exempt assets) was $422.0 million, compared
to $383.6 million last year. The taxable equivalent adjustments (the adjustments
to bring  tax-exempt  interest  to a level that would  yield the same  after-tax
income had that income been subject to taxation,  using a 35% tax rate) of $22.2
million  for 2001  and  $21.7  million  for  2000,  resulted  in  fully  taxable
equivalent  net  interest   income  of  $444.2   million  and  $405.3   million,
respectively.  The taxable  equivalent  adjustment  between years was relatively
unchanged  (up  $509,000)  and was in line with the growth in average  municipal
securities balances.

Tax equivalent  net interest  income was $444.2 million for 2001, an increase of
$38.9  million or 9.6% from 2000.  The increase in tax  equivalent  net interest
income  was  primarily  attributable  to the  benefit of lower  interest  rates,
particularly on the cost of interest-bearing  liabilities, and a higher level of
earning  assets.  Interest  rates fell steadily  during 2001, but were generally
rising during 2000.  Comparatively,  the average Federal funds rate for 2001 was
238 bp lower than for 2000,  while the rate at  December  31,  2001,  was 475 bp
lower than at December 31, 2000.

Interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain
changes in net interest income.  Interest rate spread is the difference  between
the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for  interest-bearing  liabilities
that fund those assets.  The net interest  margin is expressed as the percentage
of net  interest  income to average  earning  assets.  The net  interest  margin
exceeds the interest rate spread  because  noninterest-bearing  sources of funds
(net free funds),  principally  demand deposits and stockholders'  equity,  also
support earning assets.  To compare  tax-exempt  asset yields to taxable yields,
the yield on tax-exempt  loans and  securities  is computed on a tax  equivalent
basis.  Net interest income,  interest rate spread,  and net interest margin are
discussed further on a tax equivalent basis.

Table 2  provides  average  balances  of  earning  assets  and  interest-bearing
liabilities,  the associated interest income and expense,  and the corresponding
interest  rates earned and paid, as well as net interest  income,  interest rate
spread,  and net interest margin on a  tax-equivalent  basis for the three years
ended December 31, 2001.  Tables 3 through 5 present  additional  information to
facilitate  the review and  discussion of tax  equivalent  net interest  income,
interest rate spread, and net interest margin.

As  indicated  in Tables 2 and 3,  increases in volume and changes in the mix of
both earning assets and interest-bearing  liabilities added $18.3 million to tax
equivalent net interest  income,  while changes in the rates resulted in a $20.6
million increase, for a net increase of $38.9 million.

The net interest margin for 2001 was 3.62%, compared to 3.36% in 2000. The 26 bp
increase in net interest  margin is attributable to a 31 bp increase in interest
rate  spread  (i.e.,  an  86  bp  decrease  in  the  cost  of   interest-bearing
liabilities,  net of a 55 bp decrease in the yield on earning assets), partially
offset by a 5 bp lower contribution from net free funds. In conjunction with the
stock  buy-back  programs (see further  detail under section  "Capital"),  $34.4
million  was used in 2001 for the  repurchase  of 1.0  million  shares of common
stock,  while $92.3 million was used in 2000 to repurchase  3.7 million  shares.
Given the lower interest rate  environment  of 2001,  the  combination of buying
back fewer shares and lower  funding costs  favorably  impacted the net interest
margin by approximately 2 bp in 2001.

For 2001, the cost of  interest-bearing  liabilities  decreased 86 bp,  impacted
favorably by the  declining  rate  environment  during 2001,  reducing  interest
expense by $90.7 million (with  interest-bearing  deposits  accounting for $46.2
million of the decrease). The combined average cost of interest-bearing deposits
excluding  brokered CDs was 3.94%,  down 58 bp, primarily from carrying a higher
proportion  of  lower-costing  transaction  accounts  during 2001  versus  2000.
Higher-costing   brokered  CDs  fell  to  represent  3.8%  of   interest-bearing
liabilities  (versus 7.9% for 2000) and cost 99 bp less than last year. The cost
of wholesale funds  (comprised of all short-term  borrowings and long-term debt)
decreased 154 bp to 4.78% for 2001  (primarily a function of the declining  rate
environment and the predominantly  short-term nature of the funds) which reduced
interest expense by $44.5 million. For 2001, the yield on earning assets fell 55
bp (driven  primarily  by a 75 bp decline in the loan  yield),  which  decreased
interest earned by $70.1 million (with loans accounting for $65.4 million of the
decrease).  The  average  loan yield was 7.63%,  down 75 bp from last year.  The
repricing  of variable  rate loans,  as well as  competitive  factors on new and
refinanced  loans,  in the  declining  interest rate  environment,  put downward
pressure on loan yields for 2001, as did the sale of the higher-yielding  credit
card  receivables  in

                                       13

April 2000. The yield on securities and short-term investments combined was down
only 11 bp,  supported  by  portfolio  strategies  that  started  during 2000 to
mitigate  interest rate risk,  decreasing tax equivalent  interest  income by an
aggregate $4.7 million.

In combination,  the growth and composition change of earning assets contributed
an additional  $20.1 million to tax  equivalent net interest  income,  while the
growth and composition of  interest-bearing  liabilities cost an additional $1.8
million, netting a $18.3 million increase to tax equivalent net interest income.

Average  earning assets were $12.3 billion in 2001, an increase of $225 million,
or 1.9%,  from 2000.  Loans  accounted for the majority of the growth in earning
assets,  increasing to 74.1% of average  earning  assets,  compared to 72.1% for
2000.  Average loans were $9.1 billion in 2001, up $405 million or 4.7% compared
to 2000,  despite the sale of $128 million of credit card  receivables  in April
2000 and despite  high-refinancing  and sales of residential  mortgages in 2001.
During 2001, the  Corporation  continued to focus on shifting the composition of
its  loan  portfolio,   growing  the  proportion  of  commercial  loans,   which
represented  53.9% of average  loans for 2001  compared  to 49.6% for 2000.  For
2001,  tax  equivalent  interest  income on loans  increased  $31.1 million from
growth,  but decreased $65.4 million from the impact of the rate environment (as
noted above),  for a net decrease of $34.3  million  versus last year (see Table
3).  In  support  of  funding  a  portion  of the loan  growth,  securities  and
short-term  investments  combined  decreased $180 million on average.  Thus, for
2001, tax equivalent  interest  income on securities and short-term  investments
decreased $11.0 million from the volume changes, and decreased $4.7 million from
the rate  changes  (as noted  above),  for a net $15.7  million  decrease to tax
equivalent interest income.

Average  interest-bearing  liabilities  were  $10.8  billion  in 2001,  a slight
increase of $81.7 million,  or 0.8%, from 2000.  While  relatively  unchanged in
balance, the mix of interest-bearing  liabilities changed significantly compared
to last year. Average interest-bearing deposits, a predominant source of funding
(down $602  million  or 7.5%),  represented  69.0% of  average  interest-bearing
liabilities  for 2001,  compared to 75.1% last year,  driven by a  reduction  in
brokered CDs as cheaper funding sources were utilized. Without the brokered CDs,
interest-bearing   deposits   represented  65.2%  of  average   interest-bearing
liabilities  for 2001,  versus  67.2% last year.  Given this decline and coupled
with the  growth  in  earning  assets  and other  cash  needs,  the  Corporation
increased  its use of  wholesale  funding.  To take  advantage of the lower rate
environment, improve liquidity, and mitigate interest rate risk, the Corporation
increased its long-term  debt to 5.3% of average  interest-bearing  liabilities,
compared  to  1.1%  for  2000.   Therefore,   for  2001,   interest  expense  on
interest-bearing deposits decreased $80.9 million, the result of a $34.7 million
reduction  from the declines in volume and a $46.2  million  reduction  from the
favorable impact of the rate  environment.  To reiterate,  brokered CDs were the
predominant  driver of this change (primarily from utilization of less expensive
funding  sources),  down $436  million and costing 99 bp less in 2001 than 2000,
while all other  non-brokered  interest-bearing  deposits were down $166 million
and cost 58 bp less than last year. Total  interest-bearing  deposits cost 4.03%
on  average  for  2001  (71 bp less  than  last  year).  Total  wholesale  funds
(including   all   short-term   and   long-term   funding   sources  other  than
interest-bearing  deposits)  were $3.3  billion  on  average  for 2001,  up $683
million or 25.7%,  with $460 million of the increase in average  long-term debt.
Wholesale  funding on a combined basis cost 4.78% (154 bp lower than last year),
of which long-term debt cost 5.07% on average for 2001 (128 bp lower than 2000).
Thus,  for 2001,  interest  expense on wholesale  funds  decreased $8.0 million,
attributable to a $44.5 million  decrease from the favorable  impact of the rate
environment,  offset  partially by a $36.5  million  increase from the growth in
volume.

Provision for Loan Losses

The  provision for loan losses in 2001 was $28.2  million.  In  comparison,  the
provision  for loan  losses for 2000 was $20.2  million,  and $19.2  million for
1999.  The  provision  for  loan  losses  is  predominantly  a  function  of the
methodology  used to  determine  the adequacy of the  allowance  for loan losses
which  focuses  on  changes  in the size and  character  of the loan  portfolio,
changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming  loans,  historical losses
on each portfolio category, the risk inherent in specific loans,  concentrations
of loans to specific borrowers or industries,  existing economic conditions, the
fair value of  underlying  collateral,  and other  factors  which  could  affect
potential  credit  losses.  The ratio of the  allowance for loan losses to total
loans was  1.42%,  up from  1.35% at  December  31,  2000,  and up from 1.36% at
December 31, 1999. See additional discussion under section,  "Allowance for Loan
Losses."

Noninterest Income

Noninterest  income was $195.6  million for 2001,  $11.4  million or 6.2% higher
than 2000.  Primary  categories that have impacted the change between comparable
periods were mortgage banking, net gains (losses) on both investment  securities
and asset sales,  and trust  service  fees.  Fee income as a percentage of total
revenues (defined as total noninterest  income less gains or losses on asset and
investment  sales ("fee  income")  divided by taxable  equivalent  net  interest
income plus fee income) was 30.3% for 2001 compared to 29.2% last year.

Trust service fees for 2001 were $29.1 million,  down $8.6 million  (22.7%) from
last year. The change was predominantly due to a decrease in the market value of
assets  under  management,  a  function  of the market  and  competitive  market
conditions.  Trust assets under management totaled $4.2 billion and $4.6 billion
at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Service charges on deposits were $37.8 million, $4.5 million (13.6%) higher than
2000 primarily due to 2001 benefiting from the 2000 mid-year increases,  changes
in non-sufficient  fund/overdraft  charges and other service charges,  and lower
waive percentages.

Mortgage banking income was $53.7 million in 2001, an increase of $33.8 million,
more than double the 2000 level.  Mortgage  banking income consists of servicing
fees, the gain or loss on sales of mortgage loans to the secondary market, gains
on  sales   of   servicing,   and   production-related   revenue   (origination,
underwriting,  and escrow waiver fees).  The increase was driven  primarily by a
significant  increase in secondary  mortgage loan  production  and related sales
between  comparable  periods  ($2.3  billion of  production  in 2001 versus $456
million in 2000).  The higher  production  levels  positively  impacted gains on
sales of  mortgages  (up $29.5  million,  of which,  $4.1 million was related to
gains in the fair value of mortgage  derivatives and $4.3 million was due to the
sale of mortgage  servicing rights) and  volume-related  fees (up $6.2 million).
Servicing fees were down $1.9 million compared to 2000, in line with the decline
in the portfolio serviced for others. The portfolio serviced for others was down
5% to $5.2  billion  from $5.5  billion at December  31,  2000,  due to sales of
mortgage  servicing  rights on a portion of the portfolio,  partially  offset by
increases attributable to higher sales volume.

Credit card and other  nondeposit  fees were $26.7 million for 2001, an increase
of $0.9  million or 3.9% over 2000,  with $1.6  million  in  increased  merchant
income and a $0.6 million decline in other nondeposit charges.  The other credit
card revenue was enhanced by the April 2000 acquisition  agreement and five-year
agency agreement with Citibank USA which provide for agent fees and other income
on new and existing card business.

Retail  commission  income  (which  includes   commissions  from  insurance  and
brokerage product sales) was $16.9 million,  down $3.3 million or 16.4% compared
to last year. The decrease was primarily  attributable  to declines in the stock
market,  lower portfolio  valuations,  and general market uncertainty due to the
state  of the  economy.  Brokerage  commissions  declined  $2.1  million,  while
insurance commissions declined $1.2 million.

Asset sale gains for 2001 were $2.0  million,  including  the $0.9  million  net
premium on the sale of $12  million in  deposits  from one branch  during  2001.
Asset sale gains for 2000 were $24.4  million,  including the $12.9 million gain
recognized on the sale of $128 million  credit card  receivables to Citibank USA
and the $11.1  million net premium on the sales of $109 million in deposits from
six branches during 2000.

Bank owned life insurance income was $12.9 million, up $0.5 million or 4.4% over
last year.  Other  noninterest  income  was $15.8  million  for 2001,  down $2.5
million  from 2000.  The sale of stock in a regional  ATM network  resulted in a
gain of $2.6 million during 2001, while 2000 included $1.5 million recognized in
connection with an interim servicing  agreement with Citibank USA related to the
credit  card   receivable   sale,  and  $3.6  million  in  connection  with  the
Corporation's  mid-2000  change in data  processing and  management  information
system vendors,  both of which compensated for certain additional costs incurred
by the Corporation.

Investment  securities gains for 2001 were $0.7 million.  The 2000 net losses of
$7.6 million were primarily from various securities sold and the proceeds either
reinvested to mitigate  interest  rate risk and enhance  future yields or to pay
down higher cost borrowings.

Noninterest Expense

Total noninterest  expense for 2001 was $338.4 million,  a $20.6 million or 6.5%
increase over 2000 noninterest expense.

Personnel  expense  (including   salary-related   expenses  and  fringe  benefit
expenses)  increased $14.4 million or 9.1% over 2000, and  represented  50.6% of
total  noninterest  expense in 2001  compared to 49.4% in 2000.  Salary  expense
increased  $6.7  million or 5.3% in 2001,  despite a modest  decrease in average
full-time  equivalent  employees,  due  primarily  to  increases  in  bonus  and
incentive pay and temporary  help.  Average  full-time  equivalent  employees of
3,849  during  2001 were down 60 or 1.5%  from the  3,909  full-time  equivalent
employees during 2000. Fringe benefits increased $7.7 million in 2001, primarily
the result of a $3.8 million  increase in profit sharing expense (given a higher
profit share  percentage in 2001),  and a $2.0 million increase in premium based
benefits  (directly  related to the rising  costs of  health,  dental,  and life
insurance coverage).

Occupancy and equipment  expense on a combined basis was $38.4 million for 2001,
essentially  unchanged from last year. Data processing  costs decreased to $19.6
million,  down $2.8  million  or 12.4%  over last  year,  attributable  to lower
overall  vendor costs related to the change in service  providers and the system
conversion

                                       19

in mid-2000. Business development and advertising decreased to $13.1 million for
2001, down $0.3 million  compared to 2000,  primarily in television  advertising
for a branding campaign in 2000.

Mortgage  servicing  rights expense  includes the  amortization  of the mortgage
servicing  rights asset and  increases or decreases to the  valuation  allowance
associated with the mortgage  servicing  rights asset.  Amortization of mortgage
servicing rights increased by $10.6 million between 2001 and 2000, predominantly
driven by an increase of $10.7  million to the  valuation  reserve  during 2001,
reflecting  the  decline  in  interest  rates  in 2001 and the  acceleration  in
prepayment  speeds in the portfolio of loans serviced for others.  See Note 1 of
the notes to consolidated financial statements for the Corporation's  accounting
policy for mortgage servicing rights,  which is considered a critical accounting
policy given that  estimating  the fair value of the mortgage  servicing  rights
involves judgment, particularly of estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying
mortgages  serviced.  A valuation  allowance  is  established  to the extent the
carrying  value of the mortgage  servicing  rights  exceeds the  estimated  fair
value.  Net income could be affected if management's  estimate of the prepayment
speeds or other factors  differ  materially  from actual  prepayments.  Mortgage
servicing  rights,  included in other assets on the consolidated  balance sheet,
were $32.1 million,  net of a $10.7 million valuation  allowance at December 31,
2001 (see Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).

Intangible  amortization  decreased to $8.4 million,  primarily as the result of
the reduction of intangibles  associated with the six branches sold during 2000.
Intangible amortization includes amortization of goodwill and other identifiable
intangible  assets.  Under the  provisions  of a new  accounting  pronouncement,
goodwill and intangible  assets with  indefinite  useful lives will no longer be
amortized  beginning January 1, 2002. See further discussion under Note 1 of the
notes to consolidated financial statements.

Legal  and  professional  fees were down $3.2  million  compared  to last  year,
principally  in consultant  fees not recurring in 2001.  Other expense was $54.6
million for 2001, up $3.8 million  compared to 2000, most directly  attributable
to increased  mortgage loan expenses  related to the higher  secondary  mortgage
loan production during 2001 versus 2000 (see also section "Noninterest Income").

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for 2001 was $71.5 million,  up $9.6 million from 2000 income
tax expense of $61.8 million.  The Corporation's  effective tax rate (income tax
expense  divided by income  before taxes) was 28.5% in 2001 compared to 26.9% in
2000.  The increase  was  primarily  attributable  to the increase in net income
before tax, an increase in state tax  expense,  and a decrease in tax  valuation
allowance adjustments.

See  Note  1  of  the  notes  to  consolidated   financial  statements  for  the
Corporation's  income tax accounting policy.  Income tax expense recorded in the
consolidated income statement involves interpretation and application of certain
accounting  pronouncements  and federal and state tax codes, and is,  therefore,
considered a critical accounting policy. The Corporation  undergoes  examination
by various regulatory taxing authorities. Such agencies may require that changes
in the amount of tax expense or  valuation  allowance be  recognized  when their
interpretations differ from those of management,  based on their judgments about
information available to them at the time of their examinations.  See Note 13 of
the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Loans

Total loans were $9.0 billion at December 31, 2001,  an increase of $106 million
or 1.2% over December 31, 2000,  predominantly in commercial  loans.  Commercial
loans were $5.2  billion,  up $603  million or 13.0%.  Commercial  loans grew to
represent 58% of total loans at the end of 2001,  up from 52% at year-end  2000.
Changing the mix of loans to include  more  commercial  loans  continued to be a
strategic  initiative  during 2001. Also the decrease in residential real estate
was  strongly  influenced  by  refinance  activity  and  sales of  current  year
production into the secondary market.

Commercial,  financial,  and agricultural  loans were $1.8 billion at the end of
2001, up $126 million or 7.6% since  year-end  2000,  and comprised 20% of total
loans  outstanding,  up from 19% at the end of 2000. The commercial,  financial,
and agricultural loan  classification  primarily consists of commercial loans to
middle  market  companies  and  small  businesses.  Loans of this  type are in a
diverse  range of  industries.  The credit risk related to  commercial  loans is
largely influenced by general economic  conditions and the resulting impact on a
borrower's  operations.  Within  the  commercial,  financial,  and  agricultural
classification,  loans to finance agricultural production totaled $16.6 million,
only 0.2% of total loans, at December 31, 2001.

Real  estate  construction  loans grew $137  million  or 20.7% to $798  million,
representing 9% of the total loan portfolio at the end of 2001, compared to $661
million or 7% at the end of 2000.  Loans in this  classification  are  primarily
short-term   interim  loans  that  provide  financing  for  the  acquisition  or
development of commercial real estate,  such as multifamily or other  commercial
development projects.  Real estate construction loans are made to developers and
project  managers who are well known to the  Corporation,  have prior successful
project  experience,  and are well  capitalized.  Projects  undertaken  by these
developers  are carefully  reviewed by the  Corporation  to ensure that they are
economically viable. Loans of this type are primarily made to customers based in
the  Corporation's  tri-state  market in which the  Corporation  has a  thorough
knowledge  of the local market  economy.  The credit risk  associated  with real
estate  construction loans is generally  confined to specific  geographic areas,
but is also influenced by general economic conditions.  The Corporation controls
the credit risk on these types of loans by making  loans in familiar  markets to
developers,  underwriting  the loans to meet the  requirements of  institutional
investors in the secondary market,  reviewing the merits of individual projects,
controlling  loan structure,  and monitoring  project  progress and construction
advances.

Commercial  real  estate   includes  loans  secured  by  farmland,   multifamily
properties, and nonfarm/nonresidential  real estate properties.  Commercial real
estate  totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2001, up $343 million or 15.0% over
last year and  comprised 29% of total loans  outstanding  versus 26% at year-end
2000. Commercial real estate loans involve borrower  characteristics  similar to
those  discussed  above  for  commercial  loans  and  real   estate-construction
projects.  Loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial properties,
multifamily  properties,  community purpose properties,  and similar properties.
Loans  are  primarily  made to  customers  based  in  Wisconsin,  Illinois,  and
Minnesota.  Credit risk is managed in a similar  manner to commercial  loans and
real estate construction by employing sound underwriting guidelines,  lending to
borrowers in known markets and businesses, and formally reviewing the borrower's
financial  soundness and  relationship  on an ongoing  basis.  In many cases the
Corporation  will take additional  real estate  collateral to further secure the
overall lending relationship.

Residential  mortgage  loans totaled $3.1 billion at the end of 2001,  down $534
million  or  14.6%  from  the  prior  year  and  comprised  35% of  total  loans
outstanding  versus 41% at year-end 2000. Loans in this  classification  include
residential  real estate  (which  consists of  conventional  home  mortgages and
second mortgages) and

                                       21

home equity lines.  Residential  real estate loans  generally  limit the maximum
loan to 80% of collateral value. Residential real estate loans were $2.5 billion
at  December  31,  2001,  down $635  million  or 20.0%  compared  to last  year,
principally  due to high refinance  activity  (influenced  strongly by the lower
rate  environment  in 2001 compared to 2000 and sales of the majority of current
year  production  into the  secondary  market).  Home equity  lines grew by $100
million,  or 19.7%,  to $609  million  in 2001,  in  response  to the lower rate
environment in 2001.

Consumer loans to individuals  totaled $663 million at December 31, 2001, up $38
million  or  6.1%  compared  to  2000,  representing  7% of  the  year-end  loan
portfolio.  Installment loans include short-term  installment loans,  direct and
indirect automobile loans,  recreational vehicle loans, credit card loans (which
are primarily business-oriented following the April 2000 sale to Citibank USA of
$128  million of retail  credit  card  receivables),  student  loans,  and other
personal  loans.  Individual  borrowers  may  be  required  to  provide  related
collateral  or a  satisfactory  endorsement  or guaranty  from  another  person,
depending on the specific type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower.
Credit risk for these types of loans is generally greatly  influenced by general
economic conditions, the characteristics of individual borrowers, and the nature
of the loan  collateral.  Credit risk is primarily  controlled  by reviewing the
creditworthiness  of the borrowers as well as taking appropriate  collateral and
guaranty positions on such loans.  Factors that are critical to managing overall
credit  quality  are sound  loan  underwriting  and  administration,  systematic
monitoring  of  existing  loans and  commitments,  effective  loan  review on an
ongoing basis, early identification of potential problems, an adequate allowance
for loan losses, and sound nonaccrual and charge-off policies.

An active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to further
ensure  that sound and  consistent  credit  decisions  are made.  Credit risk is
controlled   by   detailed   underwriting    procedures,    comprehensive   loan
administration,   and  periodic  review  of  borrowers'  outstanding  loans  and
commitments.  Borrower  relationships  are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis
for early  identification of potential  problems.  Further analyses by customer,
industry,  and geographic  location are performed to monitor  trends,  financial
performance, and concentrations.

The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups,
and market areas.  Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a
financial  institution  when  there are  amounts  loaned to  numerous  borrowers
engaged in similar  activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by
economic or other  conditions.  At December 31, 2001, no  concentrations  of any
type existed in the Corporation's portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans.

                                       22

Allowance for Loan Losses

The  investment  and loan  portfolios  are the  Corporation's  primary  interest
earning assets. While the investment portfolio is structured with minimum credit
exposure to the Corporation,  the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to
credit risk.  Credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending
standards,  thorough review of potential borrowers,  and on-going review of loan
payment  performance.  Active  asset  quality  administration,  including  early
problem loan  identification and timely resolution of problems,  further ensures
appropriate  management of credit risk and  minimization of loan losses.  Credit
risk management for each loan type is discussed  briefly in the section entitled
"Loans."

At December 31, 2001, the allowance for loan losses was $128.2 million, compared
to $120.2  million at December 31, 2000.  The $8.0 million  increase was the net
result of $28.2 million  provision  for loan losses,  offset by $20.2 million of
net charge offs. As of December 31, 2001, the allowance for loan losses to total
loans was 1.42% and covered 246% of nonperforming  loans,  compared to 1.35% and
252%,  respectively,  at December 31, 2000. Tables 10 and 11 provide  additional
information  regarding  activity in the  allowance  for loan losses and Table 12
provides additional information regarding nonperforming loans.

The  provision for loan losses in 2001 was $28.2  million.  In  comparison,  the
provision  for loan losses for 2000 was $20.2 million and $19.2 million in 1999.
The provision for loan losses is  predominantly  a function of the result of the
methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses.

The  allowance  for loan losses  represents  management's  estimate of an amount
adequate to provide for probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at
the balance sheet date. See  management's  allowance for loan losses  accounting
policy in Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Management's
evaluation  of the  adequacy  of the  allowance  for  loan  losses  is  based on
management's ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio,  consideration of
past loan loss  experience,  trends in past due and  nonperforming  loans,  risk
characteristics  of the  various  classifications  of loans,  existing  economic
conditions,  the fair value of  underlying  collateral,  and other factors which
could affect potential credit losses.  Assessing these numerous factors involves
significant judgment, and therefore, management considers the allowance for loan
losses a critical accounting policy.

In  general,  the change in the  allowance  for loan  losses is a function  of a
number of factors,  including  but not limited to changes in the loan  portfolio
(see Table 8), net charge  offs (see  Table 10),  and  nonperforming  loans (see
Table 12).  First,  total loan growth from year-end 2000 to 2001 was up slightly
to 1.2%.  The growth was  strongest in the  commercial  portfolio  (particularly
commercial real estate;  commercial,  financial,  and  agricultural  loans;  and
construction  loans), which grew $603 million or 13.0% to represent 58% of total
loans at

                                       24

<PAGE>

year-end 2001 compared to 52% last year-end.  This segment of the loan portfolio
carries  greater  inherent credit risk (described  under section  "Loans").  Net
charge offs for 2001 have  increased  to $20.2  million.  The rise in net charge
offs is  largely  due to the  charge off of  several  large  commercial  credits
(accountable  for   approximately   $10.7  million  of  charge-offs).   Finally,
nonperforming loans to total loans grew to 0.58% for 2001 compared to 0.54% last
year.

The allocation of the Corporation's  allowance for loan losses for the last five
years  is  shown  in  Table  11.  The  allocation  methodology  applied  by  the
Corporation,  designed to assess the adequacy of the  allowance for loan losses,
focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan  portfolio,  changes in
levels of impaired and other nonperforming  loans, the risk inherent in specific
loans,  concentrations  of loans to specific  borrowers or industries,  existing
economic conditions,  and historical losses on each portfolio category.  Because
each of the criteria used is subject to change,  the allocation of the allowance
for  loan  losses  is  made  for  analytical  purposes  and is  not  necessarily
indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any  particular  loan category.
The total  allowance  is  available  to absorb  losses  from any  segment of the
portfolio.  Management  continues to target and maintain the  allowance for loan
losses equal to the  allocation  methodology  plus an  unallocated  portion,  as
determined by economic conditions on the Corporation's  borrowers. For both 1999
and 1998, estimation methods and assumptions included consideration of Year 2000
issues on  significant  customers.  Management  allocates the allowance for loan
losses for credit losses by pools of risk.  The business loan  (commercial  real
estate;  commercial,  financial,  and  agricultural;  leases;  and  real  estate
construction)  allocation is based on a quarterly  review of  individual  loans,
loan types,  and  industries.  The retail loan  (residential  real estate,  home
equity, and consumer) allocation is based on analysis of historical  delinquency
and  charge-off  statistics  and  trends.  Minimum  loss  factors  used  by  the
Corporation for criticized loan categories are consistent with regulatory agency
factors.  Loss factors for non-criticized loan categories are based primarily on
historical loan loss experience and peer group statistics. The mechanism used to
address  differences  between estimated and actual loan loss experience includes
review  of recent  nonperforming  loan  trends,  underwriting  trends,  external
factors, and management's judgment relating to current assumptions.

The  allocation  methods  used for  December  31,  2001 and 2000 were  generally
comparable.  However,  the  uncertainty  of current  economic  conditions on the
business  results of numerous  individual  borrowers  and certain  industries is
being  monitored  carefully,  as is the  increased  pace at which the  financial
results of a borrower's  company can take a downturn  from  difficult and varied
economic  conditions.   Therefore,  the  allocations  for  criticized  loans  in
substandard  and watch  categories  were  increased.  The  amount  allocated  to
commercial,  financial and  agricultural  loans in 2001  represented  34% of the
allowance for loan losses, compared to 38% last year. In 2000 for this category,
a greater amount of these loans were in criticized loan categories and for which
specific  allocations were made.  Thus, as anticipated,  Table 10 evidences that
this  category  incurred  the  largest  amount  of  2001  charge-offs.  Finally,
commercial,  financial and  agricultural  loans  represent 24% of  nonperforming
loans compared to 29% last year. The real estate mortgage category  accommodates
allowance  allocated for commercial real estate and residential real estate. For
2001,  the amount  allocated  for  commercial  real  estate  increased  to $48.7
million,  representing  38.0% of the allowance for loan losses compared to 21.6%
last year. The increase was a function of changes in the commercial  real estate
loan category, including increased loan balances, growing 15.0% to represent 29%
of total  loans  versus 26% at  year-end  2000,  and  increased  net  charge-off
activity of $3.3 million for 2001, versus last year of $641,000.

For 2000 compared to 1999, the amount  allocated to consumer loans  decreased to
represent 5% of the allowance for loan losses versus 13% for 1999, predominantly
as a  function  of the  sale of $128  million  of  credit  card  receivables  in
mid-2000.  Additionally,  the amount  allocated  to  commercial,  financial  and
agricultural  loans  increased  to 38%  versus  28% last  year,  in part for the
increase in the amount to criticized categories,  as noted above, and since more
of these loans were in  nonperforming  loan  categories  at year-end 2000 versus
1999 (29% and 17%, respectively).

Management  carefully  considers  numerous  detailed  and general  factors,  its
assumptions,  and the likelihood of materially  different  conditions that could
alter its assumptions. Consolidated net income could be affected if management's
estimate of the  population  of loans with  possible loss or its estimate of the
amount  of loss that  might be  incurred  are  materially  different,  requiring
additional  provision  for loan losses to be recorded.

Management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at December 31,
2001. While management uses available  information to recognize losses on loans,
future  adjustments  to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary  based on
changes  in  economic   conditions   and  the  impact  of  such  change  on  the
Corporation's  borrowers.  As an  integral  part of their  examination  process,
various  regulatory  agencies also review the  allowance  for loan losses.  Such
agencies  may require that certain loan balance be charged off when their credit
evaluations  differ from those of  management,  based on their  judgments  about
information available to them at the time of their examination.

Net charge offs were $20.2 million or 0.22% of average loans for 2001,  compared
to $9.0 million or 0.10% of average  loans for 2000,  and were $13.7  million or
0.18% of average loans for 1999.  The $11.3 million  increase in net charge offs
was  primarily  driven  by  higher  charge-offs  of  commercial,  financial  and
agricultural  loans in 2001 versus 2000 (at $11.3  million,  up $9.6  million as
shown in Table 10). This rise in charge offs is predominantly  due to the charge
off of several large commercial  credits  (accountable for  approximately  $10.7
million of the  charge-offs)  during  2001.  Loans  charged  off are  subject to
continuous review, and specific efforts are taken to achieve maximum recovery of
principal, accrued interest, and related expenses.

Nonperforming Loans, Potential Problem Loans, and Other Real Estate Owned

Management   is  committed  to  an  aggressive   nonaccrual   and  problem  loan
identification  philosophy.  This  philosophy  is  embodied  through the ongoing
monitoring  and  reviewing of all pools of risk in the loan  portfolio to ensure
that all problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized.

Nonperforming  loans are defined as nonaccrual loans, loans 90 days or more past
due but still accruing,  and restructured  loans.  The Corporation  specifically
excludes from its definition of  nonperforming  loans student loan balances that
are 90 days or more  past  due and  still  accruing  and that  have  contractual
government guarantees as to collection of principal and interest.  Such past due
student loans were approximately $21.0 million and $19.5 million at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when  contractually  past due 90
days  or more as to  interest  or  principal  payments.  Additionally,  whenever
management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the
collectibility of principal or interest on loans, it is management's practice to
place such loans on  nonaccrual  status  immediately,  rather than delaying such
action  until  the  loans  become  90 days  past  due.  Previously  accrued  and
uncollected  interest on such loans is  reversed,  amortization  of related loan
fees is  suspended,  and income is  recorded  only to the extent  that  interest
payments are  subsequently  received in cash and a  determination  has been made
that the principal balance of the loan is collectible.  If collectibility of the
principal is in doubt, payments received are applied to loan principal.

Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing  interest are also included in
nonperforming  loans.  Loans  past due 90 days or more but  still  accruing  are
classified  as such  where  the  underlying  loans are both  well  secured  (the
collateral  value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued  interest) and in
the  process  of   collection.   Also  included  in   nonperforming   loans  are
"restructured" loans. Restructured loans involve the granting of some

                                       26

concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan, such
as changes in payment schedule or interest rate.

Nonperforming  loans at December 31, 2001,  were $52.1  million,  an increase of
$4.4 million from December 31, 2000. The ratio of  nonperforming  loans to total
loans at the end of 2001 was 0.58%,  as  compared to 0.54% and 0.44% at December
31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Nonaccrual loans accounted for $7.2 million of
the increase in nonperforming loans,  partially offset by a $2.8 million decline
in  accruing  loans  past  due 90  days or  more.  Commercial  nonaccrual  loans
(representing  approximately 65% of nonaccrual loans at year-end 2001 versus 67%
at year-end 2000) increased $4.0 million,  predominantly  due to the addition of
one large commercial  credit  (totaling  approximately  $3.1 million).  Accruing
loans past due 90 days or more  declined  as the result of one large  commercial
credit that went on  nonaccrual  during 2001,  and was  subsequently  repaid and
partially  charged  off.  The   Corporation's   allowance  for  loan  losses  to
nonperforming  loans was 246% at year-end 2001,  down from 252% at year-end 2000
and 307% at year-end 1999.

Other real estate owned decreased to $2.7 million at December 31, 2001, compared
to $4.0 million and $3.7 million at year-end  2000 and 1999,  respectively.  Net
gains on sales of other real estate owned were  $643,000,  $116,000 and $403,000
for 2001,  2000,  and 1999,  respectively.  Management  actively seeks to ensure
properties held are monitored to minimize the Corporation's risk of loss.

The following table shows,  for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual  basis
and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated, the gross interest that
would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance  with their
original  terms and the amount of interest  income that was included in interest
income for the period.

Potential  problem  loans are loans  where there are doubts as to the ability of
the borrower to comply with present  repayment terms. The decision of management
to  place  loans  in this  category  does  not  necessarily  indicate  that  the
Corporation  expects  losses to occur,  but that  management  recognizes  that a
higher degree of risk is associated with these performing loans. At December 31,
2001,  potential problem loans totaled


                                       27

$177.8 million. The loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are
not concentrated in a particular  industry,  but rather cover a diverse range of
businesses. Management does not presently expect significant losses from credits
in the potential problem loan category.

Investment Securities Portfolio

The investment  securities portfolio is intended to provide the Corporation with
adequate liquidity,  flexibility in asset/liability  management, and a source of
stable income.  Investment securities classified as held to maturity are carried
in the consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost while investment  securities
classified as available  for sale are carried at fair market value.  At December
31, 2001, the total carrying value of investment  securities  represented 23% of
total  assets,  compared to 25% at year-end  2000.  On average,  the  investment
portfolio  represented  26% and 28% of average earning assets for 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

The  classification  of  securities as held to maturity or available for sale is
determined at the time of purchase.  Beginning in 1998, the Corporation began to
classify most  investment  purchases as available  for sale.  This is consistent
with the  Corporation's  investment  philosophy of  maintaining  flexibility  to
manage  the  investment  portfolio,  particularly  in light  of  asset/liability
management  strategies,  including  possible  securities  sales in  response  to
changes in interest  rates or  prepayment  risk,  the need to manage  regulatory
capital, and other factors.  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
("SFAS 133"),  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities,"
which was adopted by the  Corporation  as required on January 1, 2001,  provided
for the option, upon adoption, to change the classification of investments held.
Thus, on January 1, 2001, the Corporation  reclassified all its held to maturity
securities to available for sale  securities.  The amortized cost and fair value
of the securities transferred were $369 million and $373 million,  respectively.
SFAS  133  is  more  fully  described  under  Notes  1 and 15 of  the  notes  to
consolidated financial statements.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, mortgage-related securities represented 52.7% and
49.7%, respectively, of total investment securities based on amortized cost. The
fair value of  mortgage-related  securities  are subject to inherent risks based
upon the future performance of the underlying  collateral (i.e.  mortgage loans)
for these securities, such as prepayment risk and interest rate changes.

At December 31, 2001,  the  Corporation's  securities  portfolio did not contain
securities,  other than U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, of any single issuer
that were  payable  from and  secured  by the same  source of  revenue or taxing
authority where the aggregate carrying value of such securities  exceeded 10% of
stockholders' equity or $1.1 billion.

Deposits

Deposits are the  Corporation's  largest source of funds.  At December 31, 2001,
deposits were $8.6 billion,  down $679 million or 7.3% over last year, primarily
in brokered certificates of deposit ("CDs") (down $626 million).  Total deposits
excluding  brokered CDs  ("nonbrokered  deposits")  were relatively flat between
year-end  periods.  The sale of  deposits of one branch  during  2001  decreased
deposits by $12 million. The sale of six branches during 2000 decreased deposits
at year-end 2000 by approximately $109 million.

The primary factors influencing the Corporation's nonbrokered deposit growth has
been competitive  pressure from other financial  institutions,  as well as other
investment  opportunities  available to customers.  During 2001 the  Corporation
particularly  marketed its business demand  deposits and money market  accounts,
which offer competitive, market-indexed rates, and greater customer flexibility.

On average,  deposits were $8.6 billion for 2001, down $522 million or 5.7% over
the average for 2000.  However,  excluding the $436 million  decrease in average
brokered CDs,  deposits were down 1.0%.  As previously  mentioned  under section
"Net  Interest   Income,"  the  decline  in  average   deposits   increased  the
Corporation's  reliance on wholesale funding,  as discussed under section "Other
Funding Sources."

Table  16  summarizes  the   distribution  of  average   deposits.   A  maturity
distribution  of certificates of deposits and other time deposits of $100,000 or
more at December 31, 2001, is shown in Table 17.

Other Funding Sources

Other funding sources,  including both long-term debt and short-term  borrowings
("wholesale  funds"),  were $3.7 billion at December  31, 2001,  up $1.0 billion
from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2000. Long-term debt at December 31, 2001, was
$1.1  billion,  up from  $122.4  million  at the end of  last  year,  due to the
issuance of $200 million of subordinated  debt, $200 million of bank notes,  and
the use of long-term  Federal Home Loan Bank advances.  See Note 10 of the notes
to  consolidated  financial  statements for additional  information on long-term
debt.  Short-term borrowings are primarily comprised of Federal funds purchased;
securities  sold under  agreements to repurchase;  short-term  Federal Home Loan
Bank  advances;  notes  payable to banks;  treasury,  tax,  and loan notes;  and
commercial  paper.  The Federal Home Loan Bank  advances  included in short-term
borrowings  are those  with  original  maturities  of less  than one  year.  The
treasury,  tax, and loan notes are demand notes representing  secured borrowings
from the U.S. Treasury,  collateralized by qualifying  securities and loans. The
funds  are  placed  with  the  subsidiary  banks at the  discretion  of the U.S.
Treasury and may be called at any time. See Note 9 of the notes to  consolidated
financial statements for additional  information on short-term  borrowings,  and
Table  18 for  specific  disclosure  required  for  major  short-term  borrowing
categories.

Wholesale  funds on average were $3.3 billion for 2001, up $683 million or 25.7%
over 2000. The reliance on wholesale  funds  increased  during 2001 as mentioned
under both sections "Net Interest  Income" and "Deposits".  The mix of wholesale
funding  shifted toward  longer-term  instruments,  with average  long-term debt
representing 17.2% of wholesale funds compared to 4.3% last year, in response to
certain  asset/liability  objectives and favorable  interest  rates.  Within the
short-term borrowing categories,  average Federal funds purchased and securities
sold under agreements to repurchase were up $115 million and short-term  Federal
Home Loan Bank advances were up $181 million.

Liquidity

The objective of liquidity  management is to ensure that the Corporation has the
ability  to  generate  sufficient  cash  or cash  equivalents  in a  timely  and
cost-effective  manner  to meet its  commitments  as they  fall  due.  Funds are
available  from a number of sources,  primarily  from the core  deposit base and
from loans and securities repayments and maturities.  Additionally, liquidity is
provided  from sales of the  securities  portfolio,  lines of credit  with major
banks,  the ability to acquire large and brokered  deposits,  and the ability to
securitize or package loans for sale.


The Corporation's liquidity management framework includes measurement of several
key elements,  such as wholesale funding as a percent of total assets and liquid
assets to short-term  wholesale funding.  The Corporation's  liquidity framework
also  incorporates  contingency  planning to assess the nature and volatility of
funding sources and to determine  alternatives to these sources. The contingency
plan would be activated to ensure the Corporation's funding commitments could be
met in the event of general market disruption or adverse economic conditions.

Strong  capital  ratios,  credit  quality and core  earnings  are  essential  to
retaining high credit ratings and,  consequently,  cost-effective  access to the
wholesale  funding markets.  A downgrade or loss in credit ratings could have an
impact on the  Corporation's  ability to access  wholesale  funding at favorable
interest rates.  As a result,  capital ratios,  asset quality  measurements  and
profitability  ratios are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the liquidity
management process.

While core deposits and loan and investment  repayment are principal  sources of
liquidity,   funding   diversification  is  another  key  element  of  liquidity
management. Diversity is achieved by strategically varying depositor type, term,
funding market, and instrument.

The parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds necessary
to  pay  dividends  to  stockholders,  service  debt,  invest  in  subsidiaries,
repurchase  common stock, and satisfy other operating

                                       31

<PAGE>

requirements. The parent company's primary funding sources to meet its liquidity
requirements are dividends and service fees from  subsidiaries,  borrowings with
major  banks,  commercial  paper  issuance,  and  proceeds  from the issuance of
equity.  Dividends  received in cash from subsidiaries  totaled $90.0 million in
2001 and  represent a primary  funding  source.  At December  31,  2001,  $148.0
million  in  dividends  could  be paid to the  parent  by its  subsidiaries  and
affiliates without obtaining prior regulatory  approval,  subject to the capital
needs of the banks. As discussed in Item 1, the subsidiary  banks are subject to
regulation  and,  among  other  things,  may be limited in their  ability to pay
dividends or transfer  funds to the parent  company.  Accordingly,  consolidated
cash flows as presented  in the  consolidated  statements  of cash flows may not
represent  cash  immediately  available for the payment of cash dividends to the
Corporation's stockholders or for other cash needs.

In addition to affiliate  dividends,  the parent  company has  multiple  funding
sources  that  could  be used  to  increase  liquidity  and  provide  additional
financial  flexibility.  These  sources  include a  revolving  credit  facility,
commercial  paper and a shelf  registration.  The parent company has available a
$100 million  revolving  credit facility with  established  lines of credit from
nonaffiliated  banks,  of which $100 million was available at December 31, 2001.
During 2000, a $200 million  commercial  paper program was  initiated,  of which
$200 million was available at December 31, 2001. Additionally,  effective in May
2001,  the parent  company filed a  registration  statement  utilizing a "shelf"
registration process.  Under this shelf process, the parent company may offer up
to  $500  million  of  any  combination  of  the  following  securities,  either
separately or in units:  debt securities,  preferred stock,  depositary  shares,
common stock,  and warrants.  In August 2001, the parent  company  obtained $200
million in a subordinated notes offering,  bearing a 6.75% fixed coupon rate and
a 10-year  maturity.  At December 31, 2001, $300 million was available under the
shelf registration.

Investment  securities  are an  important  tool to the  Corporation's  liquidity
objective.  As of December 31, 2001,  all securities are classified as available
for sale. Of the $3.2 billion investment portfolio, $1.0 billion were pledged as
collateral for repurchase agreements, representing a lower-cost source of funds.
The  remaining  securities  could be  pledged or sold to  enhance  liquidity  if
necessary.

The bank  affiliates  have a variety  of funding  sources  (in  addition  to key
liquidity  sources,  such as core deposits,  loan sales,  loan  repayments,  and
investment portfolio sales) available to increase financial flexibility.  During
2000, the four largest  subsidiary  banks  (Associated  Bank Illinois,  National
Association,  Associated  Bank Milwaukee,  Associated  Bank Green Bay,  National
Association,  and  Associated  Bank North)  established a $2.0 billion bank note
program. As noted in the opening section of Item 7, Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations,  during the second
quarter  of 2001  the  Corporation  merged  its  Wisconsin  banks  into a single
national charter named Associated Bank, National Association; thus, subsequently
the  program  is  available  for  use  by  Associated  Bank  Illinois,  National
Association  and  Associated  Bank,  National  Association.  Under this program,
short-term and long-term  debt may be issued.  In April 2001,  Associated  Bank,
National  Association  obtained $200 million of variable rate notes that reprice
quarterly at LIBOR plus 22 bp and bear a two-year  maturity.  As of December 31,
2001, $1.8 billion was available.  The banks have also established federal funds
lines with major banks  totaling  approximately  $2.3 billion and the ability to
borrow  approximately $1.3 billion from the Federal Home Loan Bank ($1.1 billion
was  outstanding at December 31, 2001).  In addition,  the bank  affiliates also
accept Eurodollar deposits, issue institutional CDs, and from time to time offer
brokered CDs.

Through the normal  course of  operations,  the  Corporation  has  entered  into
certain  contractual   obligations  and  other  commitments.   Such  obligations
generally relate to funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances, as
well as leases for premises and equipment.  As a financial  service provider the
Corporation   routinely  enters  into   commitments  to  extend  credit.   While
contractual obligations represent future cash requirements of the Corporation, a
significant  portion of  commitments  to extend credit may expire  without being
drawn  upon.  Such  commitments  are  subject to the same  credit  policies  and
approval process accorded to loans made by the Corporation.

For the  year  ended  December  31,  2001,  net  cash  provided  from  financing
activities was $238.1 million, while operating and investing activities used net
cash of $409,000 and $28.8 million, respectively, for a net increase in cash and
cash equivalents of $208.9 million since year-end 2000. Generally,  during 2001,
time deposits  matured that were not renewed  (primarily in brokered CDs), while
total asset growth since  year-end  2000 was  moderate.  Thus,  other  financing
sources increased,  particularly long-term debt and other short-term borrowings,
to help  replenish  the net decrease in deposits and to provide for common stock
repurchases and payment of cash dividends to the Corporation's stockholders.

For the year ended  December 31, 2000, net cash was provided from both operating
and financing  activities  ($189.2  million and $367.7  million,  respectively),
while investing  activities used net cash of $474.5 million,  for a net increase
in cash and cash  equivalents of $82.4 million since  year-end 1999.  Generally,
total assets grew modestly  during 2000,  primarily in loans,  and cash was also
needed for payment of cash  dividends  and for common stock  repurchases.  These
needs  were  funded by  increased  deposits  (primarily  brokered  CDs),  net of
deposits  sold,  and by proceeds  from the sale of the credit card  receivables.
During 2000,  proceeds from the sales and  maturities  of investment  securities
were predominantly  reinvested by the Corporation to mitigate interest rate risk
and enhance future investment yields.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest  rates,  exchange rates,
commodity prices,  and other relevant market rate or price risk. The Corporation
faces market risk in the form of interest  rate risk through  other than trading
activities.  Market  risk from  other  than  trading  activities  in the form of
interest  rate risk is  measured  and managed  through a number of methods.  The
Corporation uses financial  modeling  techniques that measure the sensitivity of
future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk.
Policies established by the Corporation's Asset/Liability Committee and approved
by the  Corporation's  Board of  Directors  limit  exposure of earnings at risk.
General  interest  rate  movements  are  used  to  develop  sensitivity  as  the
Corporation  feels it has no primary  exposure to a specific  point on the yield
curve. These limits are based on the Corporation's  exposure to a 100 bp and 200
bp immediate and sustained parallel rate move, either upward or downward.

Interest Rate Risk

In order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates, the Corporation uses
three different measurement tools: static gap analysis,  simulation of earnings,
and economic value of equity.  The static gap analysis  starts with  contractual
repricing   information  for  assets,   liabilities,   and   off-balance   sheet
instruments.  These  items are then  combined  with  repricing  estimations  for
administered rate (interest-bearing  demand deposits,  savings, and money market
accounts) and non-rate related products (demand deposit accounts,  other assets,
and other liabilities) to create a baseline repricing balance sheet. In addition
to the  contractual  information,  residential  mortgage whole loan products and
mortgage-backed   securities  are  adjusted  based  on  industry   estimates  of

                                       33

<PAGE>

prepayment  speeds that capture the expected  prepayment of principal  above the
contractual  amount based on how far away the contractual  coupon is from market
coupon rates.

position as of December 31, 2001.

     experiences, a portion of these balances are considered to be long-term and
     fairly stable and are therefore included in the "Over 1 Year" category.
(2)  For analysis  purposes,  Brokered CDs of $290,000  have been  included with
     other  interest-bearing  liabilities  and  excluded  from  interest-bearing
     deposits.

The  static  gap  analysis  in  Table  21  provides  a  representation   of  the
Corporation's  earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It is a static
indicator that does not reflect various  repricing  characteristics  and may not
necessarily  indicate  the  sensitivity  of net  interest  income in a  changing
interest rate environment.

Interest  rate  risk  of  embedded  positions  including  prepayment  and  early
withdrawal  options,  lagged interest rate changes,  administered  interest rate
products,  and cap and floor  options  within  products  require a more  dynamic
measuring tool to capture earnings risk.  Earnings simulation and economic value
of equity are used to more completely assess interest rate risk.

Along with the static gap analysis,  determining  the  sensitivity of short term
future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus 100 and 200 basis point parallel
rate  shock can be  accomplished  through  the use of  simulation  modeling.  In
addition  to the  assumptions  used to create  the  static  gap,  simulation  of
earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity. Future
business  assumptions  involving  administered  rate products,  prepayments  for
future  rate-sensitive  balances,  and the  reinvestment  of maturing assets and
liabilities  are included.  These items are then modeled to project net interest
income based on a  hypothetical  change in interest  rates.  The  resulting  net
interest  income for the next  12-month  period is compared to the net  interest
income  amount  calculated  using flat rates.  This  difference  represents  the
Corporation's  earnings  sensitivity to a plus or minus 100 basis point parallel
rate shock.

The resulting  simulations  for December 31, 2001,  projected  that net interest
income would decrease by  approximately  1.6% of budgeted net interest income if
rates rose by a 100 basis point shock,  and projected  that

                                       34

<PAGE>

net  interest  income  would  decrease by  approximately  0.1% of  budgeted  net
interest  income if rates fell by a 100 basis point shock. At December 31, 2000,
the 100 basis point shock up was  projected to decrease  net interest  income by
3.4%,  and the 100 basis point shock down  projected  that net  interest  income
would increase by 2.6%.

Economic  value of equity is another tool used to measure the impact of interest
rates  on the  present  value  of  assets,  liabilities  and  off-balance  sheet
financial  instruments.  This measurement is a longer-term  analysis of interest
rate risk as it evaluates every cash flow produced by the current balance sheet.
The projected  changes for earnings  simulation and economic value of equity for
both 2001 and 2000 were  within the  Corporation's  interest  rate risk  policy.
According to the interest rate risk tests  discussed  above,  the  Corporation's
sensitivity to interest rate changes  decreased  during 2001.  This reduction in
interest  sensitivity  came from changes in the mix of the balance sheet and the
use of long-term debt.

These results are based solely on immediate and  sustained  parallel  changes in
market  rates and do not reflect the  earnings  sensitivity  that may arise from
other  factors.  These  factors  may  include  changes in the shape of the yield
curve, the change in spread between key market rates, or accounting  recognition
of the impairment of certain intangibles.  The above results are also considered
to be  conservative  estimates  due to the fact  that no  management  action  to
mitigate potential income variances are included within the simulation  process.
This action could include,  but would not be limited to, delaying an increase in
deposit rates,  extending  liabilities,  using financial  derivative products to
hedge  interest rate risk,  changing the pricing  characteristics  of loans,  or
changing the growth rate of certain assets and liabilities.

The  Corporation  uses  interest rate  derivative  financial  instruments  as an
asset/liability  management  tool to hedge  mismatches in interest rate exposure
indicated by the net interest income  simulation  described above. They are used
to reduce the  Corporation's  exposure to interest rate fluctuations and provide
more stable spreads between loan yields and the rate on their funding sources.

In 2001,  the  Corporation  executed  $523 million of new interest rate swaps to
reduce  interest  rate risk.  Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-
and  variable-rate  payments  without the  exchange of the  underlying  notional
amount on which the interest payments are calculated.

To hedge against rising  interest  rates,  the Corporation may use interest rate
caps.  Counterparties to these interest cap agreements pay the Corporation based
on the  notional  amount and the  difference  between  current  rates and strike
rates.  At December  31,  2001,  there were $200  million of interest  rate caps
outstanding,  which have a six month  LIBOR  strike of 4.72%.  To hedge  against
falling interest rates, the Corporation may use interest rate floors. Like caps,
counterparties  to interest rate floor  agreements pay the Corporation  based on
the notional  amount and the difference  between current rates and strike rates.
There were no floors  outstanding  at December  31, 2001.  Derivative  financial
instruments are also discussed in Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial
statements.

Capital

Stockholders'  equity at December 31, 2001,  increased to $1.1 billion or $16.38
per share,  compared with $968.7 million or $14.65 per share at the end of 2000.
Stockholders'  equity is also described in Note 11 of the notes to  consolidated
financial statements.

The increase in stockholders' equity in 2001 was primarily composed of retention
of earnings  and the exercise of stock  options,  with  offsetting  decreases to
stockholders'  equity from the payment of cash  dividends and the  repurchase of
common stock. Additionally, stockholders' equity at year-end 2001 included $47.2
million of accumulated  other  comprehensive  income,  predominantly  related to
unrealized  gains on securities  available for sale,  net of the tax effect.  At
December 31, 2000,  stockholders'  equity  included $15.6 million of accumulated
other comprehensive  income related to unrealized gains on securities  available
for sale, net of the tax effect.  Stockholders' equity to assets at December 31,
2001 was 7.87%, compared to 7.38% at the end of 2000.

Cash dividends paid in 2001 were $1.22 per share,  compared with $1.11 per share

The adequacy of the Corporation's  capital is regularly  reviewed to ensure that
sufficient  capital  is  available  for  current  and  future  needs  and  is in
compliance  with  regulatory  guidelines.  The  assessment  of  overall  capital
adequacy  depends on a variety of factors,  including asset quality,  liquidity,
stability  of  earnings,  changing  competitive  forces,  economic  condition in
markets served, and strength of management.

As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the  Corporation's  Tier 1 risk-based  capital
ratios, total risk-based capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) ratios, and Tier 1 leverage
ratios were in excess of regulatory  minimum and well capitalized  requirements.
It is management's  intent to exceed the minimum requisite  capital levels.  The
increase  in the total  risk-based  capital  ratio for 2001  compared to 2000 is
primarily  attributable to the subordinated  debt issued in 2001 which qualifies
as Tier 2  supplementary  capital for  regulatory  purposes.  Capital ratios are
included in Note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

The Board of Directors has  authorized  management  to repurchase  shares of the
Corporation's  common stock each quarter in the market, to be made available for
issuance in connection with the Corporation's  employee

                                       36

<PAGE>

incentive  plans  and for  other  corporate  purposes.  The  Board of  Directors
authorized  the  repurchase  of up to 1.2  million  shares  (300,000  shares per
quarter) in 2001 and 2000. Of these authorizations, approximately 800,000 shares
were  repurchased for $26.7 million during 2001 (with 247,000 shares reissued in
connection with stock options  exercised),  and 418,000 shares were  repurchased
for $10.6 million in 2000 (with 322,000 shares reissued for options  exercised).
Additionally,  under  two  separate  actions  in 2000,  the  Board of  Directors
authorized the  repurchase and  cancellation  of the  Corporation's  outstanding
shares,  not to exceed  approximately  6.7 million  shares on a combined  basis.
Under these  authorizations  228,000  shares were  repurchased  for $7.7 million
during 2001,  at an average cost of $33.88 per share,  while  approximately  3.1
million  shares  remain  authorized  to  repurchase  at December 31,  2001.  The
repurchase  of shares  will be based on market  opportunities,  capital  levels,
growth prospects, and other investment opportunities.

Shares repurchased and not retired are held as treasury stock and,  accordingly,
are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders' equity.

Management  believes  that a  strong  capital  position  is  necessary  to  take
advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion,  and
to provide  depositor  and  investor  confidence.  Management  actively  reviews
capital  strategies for the Corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of
perceived business risks, future growth opportunities,  industry standards,  and
regulatory  requirements.  It is  management's  intent to  maintain  an  optimal
capital and leverage mix for growth and for shareholder return.

Fourth Quarter 2001 Results

Net income for fourth  quarter  2001  ("4Q01") was $46.3  million,  $6.6 million
higher than the $39.7 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2000 ("4Q00"). ROE
was 17.03%, 8 bp higher than 4Q00, while ROA increased 18 basis points to 1.39%.

Taxable  equivalent  net  interest  income  for 4Q01 was $119.6  million,  $19.4
million higher than 4Q00. The predominant  factor  impacting net interest income
and net interest margin was the differing interest rate environment  between the
comparable  quarters.  The average Fed funds rate for 4Q01 was 436 bp lower than
the  comparable  quarter last year,  with rates steadily  declining  during 4Q01
versus level during 4Q00. The $19.4 million  increase in net interest income was
principally  attributable  to  rate,  with a 63 bp rise in net  interest  margin
increasing  net interest  income by  approximately  $17.6 million and changes in
balance sheet growth and mix adding approximately $1.8 million of additional net
interest  income.  For 4Q01, net interest  margin was 3.83% compared to 3.20% in
4Q00.  The rate on  interest-bearing  liabilities  decreased 207 bp to 3.32% due
principally  to repricing of deposit  products and wholesale  funds in the lower
interest  rate  environment.  The yield on earning  assets,  which are slower to
reprice,  dropped 126 bp to 6.70% in 4Q01.  The net result was an 81 bp increase
in interest  rate spread.  The increase in spread was offset in part by an 18 bp
reduction in net free funds  contribution.  Average earning asset growth (up $82
million to $12.4 billion) and decreases in interest-bearing  deposits (down $1.0
billion) were funded primarily with other wholesale funds (up $855 million).  To
take advantage of the lower interest rate environment, the Corporation increased
the levels of long-term debt by replacing short-term funding balances throughout
2001 with $200 million of  subordinated  debt,  $200 million of bank notes,  and
longer term Federal Home Loan Bank advances.

The  provision  for loan losses of $9.3 million in 4Q01 was up $4.1 million from
4Q00, as more was provided in 2001 due to declines in asset  quality  related to
the  weakening  economy and its impact on borrowers,  and increased  risk in the
portfolio.

Noninterest  income in 4Q01 was $8.7 million higher than the comparable  quarter
in 2000.  Mortgage  banking revenue was up $12.2 million,  more than triple,  to
$17.5 million.  Record high secondary mortgage  production ($806 million in 4Q01
versus $174 million in 4Q00) and  favorable  pricing led to  increased  gains on
sales (up $10.8 million) and higher  production-related fees. Service charges on
deposit  accounts were up $1.1 million,  principally from higher service charges
on  business  accounts.  Gains on the sale of assets  was up $1.0  million,  due
predominantly to the net premium on deposits from a branch sale in 4Q01. Revenue
decreases  occurred  in  trust  service  fees,  down  $1.3  million  due  to the
deterioration  in market  conditions  and,  correspondingly,  to lower portfolio
valuations,  while other income was down $3.8 million,  attributable to the $3.6
million

                                       37

settlement  recorded  in 4Q00  for the  Corporation's  mid-year  change  in data
processing  vendors.  The remaining  noninterest income categories  collectively
decreased $0.7 million or 4% from the same period last year.

Noninterest  expense  between  the  comparable  quarters  was up $15.6  million.
Personnel expense was $7.5 million higher, with salaries and related expenses up
$3.0 million and fringe  benefits up $4.5 million.  The increase in salaries was
due primarily to higher base salaries in 2001 and higher bonuses and incentives.
The increase in fringe  benefits was  primarily  attributable  to higher  profit
sharing expenses and higher health insurance coverage costs.  Mortgage servicing
rights expense  increased by $5.4 million,  primarily the result of $5.1 million
additional valuation reserve recorded on the servicing portfolio given the lower
fair value of  mortgage  servicing  rights due to the rate  environment  and the
acceleration  of  prepayments  between the periods.  Other expenses were up $2.4
million,   with  loan  expenses  higher  by  $1.1  million,   predominantly   in
volume-driven  credit card and mortgage  loan fees.  The  remaining  noninterest
expense categories were level on a comparable quarter basis.  Income tax expense
was up $2.1 million between the fourth quarters due to higher income before tax,
partially  offset by a decrease  in the  effective  tax rate,  at 26.8% for 4Q01
compared to 27.3% for 4Q00.

2000 Compared to 1999

The  Corporation  recorded  net  income of  $168.0  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2000,  an increase of $3.0 million or 1.8% over the $164.9  million
earned in 1999.  Basic  earnings per share for 2000 were $2.46,  a

                                       38

4.2% increase over 1999 basic earnings per share of $2.36.  Earnings per diluted
share were $2.46, a 5.1% increase over 1999 diluted earnings per share of $2.34.
Return on average  assets  and return on average  equity for 2000 were 1.31% and
18.26%, respectively, compared to 1.41% and 18.04%, respectively, for 1999. Cash
dividends  paid in 2000  increased by 5.0% to $1.11 per share over the $1.05 per
share paid in 1999. Key factors behind these results were:

Taxable equivalent net interest income was $405.3 million for 2000, $4.1 million
or 1.0% lower than 1999. Taxable equivalent  interest income increased by $124.7
million,  while interest expense increased $128.8 million. The volume of average
earning assets  increased $1.1 billion (with $887 million  attributable  to loan
growth) to $12.0 billion, which exceeded the $1.0 billion (with $599 million due
to increased reliance on brokered CDs) increase in interest-bearing liabilities.
Although  increases  in  the  volume  of  earning  assets  and  interest-bearing
liabilities,  as well as changes in product mix,  added $32.4 million to taxable
equivalent  net interest  income,  changes in interest rates resulted in a $36.5
million decrease.

Net interest  income and net interest  margin were also  impacted in 2000 by the
rising interest rate environment,  competitive pricing pressures, branch deposit
and credit card receivable sales, and funding of stock repurchases.  The Federal
Reserve  raised  interest  rates six times between July 1999 and December  2000,
producing an average Federal funds rate for 2000 that was 131 bp higher than the
average for 1999.

The net interest margin was 3.36% for 2000, a 38 bp decline from 3.74% for 1999,
the net result of the 45 bp decrease in interest  rate spread,  offset by a 7 bp
improvement  in the net  free  funds  contribution.  Rates  on  interest-bearing
liabilities  in 2000 were 80 bp higher than in 1999,  while the yield on earning
assets increased 35 bp, bringing the interest rate spread down by 45 bp.

Total loans were $8.9 billion at December 31, 2000,  an increase of $570 million
or 6.8% over December 31, 1999, predominantly in commercial loans. Excluding the
sale of $128 million of credit card  receivables in 2000,  total loans were 8.4%
higher at year-end 2000 than a year earlier. Total deposits were $9.3 billion at
December 31, 2000, $600 million higher than December 31, 1999,  despite the sale
of six Illinois branch offices in 2000 with deposits totaling $109 million.  The
growth was predominantly in brokered CDs.

Asset  quality  remained  relatively  strong.  The  provision  for loans  losses
increased to $20.2 million  compared to $19.2 million in 1999.  Net  charge-offs
decreased $4.8 million,  primarily due to fewer net  charge-offs on credit cards
between the years,  given the sale of credit card receivables in April 2000. Net
charge-offs  were 0.10% of average loans compared to 0.18% in 1999. The ratio of
allowance  for loan losses to loans was 1.35% and 1.36% at December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively.  Nonperforming loans were $47.7 million,  representing 0.54%
of total loans at  year-end  2000,  compared to $36.9  million or 0.44% of total
loans in 1999.

Noninterest  income was $184.2  million for 2000,  $18.3 million or 11.0% higher
than 1999.  Net gains on the sales of assets and investment  securities  totaled
$16.8 million in 2000  compared to net gains of $8.0 million in 1999.  Key sales
in  2000  included  a  $12.9  million  gain  on  the  sale  of the  credit  card
receivables,  the $11.1  million  net  premium on the sales of  deposits  of six
branches,  and $7.6  million  net losses on the sale of  investment  securities.
Excluding these asset and security sales, noninterest income was $167.4 million,
or $9.5 million (6.0%) higher than 1999. With the exception of mortgage banking,
which  was  impacted  by  a  year-over-year   slowdown  in  secondary   mortgage
production, all other noninterest income categories collectively increased $20.0
million or 15.7% in 2000 compared to 1999.

Noninterest  expense  was $317.7  million,  up $12.6  million or 4.1% over 1999.
However,  1999 expenses were reduced by two large items  totaling $12.0 million,
namely  the  $8.0  million  reversal  of  mortgage  servicing  rights  valuation
allowance and a $4.0 million reduction in profit sharing expense.  Not including
these items,  noninterest  expense was relatively  unchanged (up $6.0 million or
0.2%),  despite  adding $10.9 million of  incremental  expenses in 2000 from the
1999 purchase acquisitions.  Excluding the acquisitions, as well as the two 1999
items noted above, noninterest expense was $10.3 million (3.4%) lower than 1999.

Income tax expense decreased to $61.8 million, down $10.5 million from 1999. The
effective tax rate in 2000 was 26.9%  compared to 30.5% for 1999, due to the tax
benefits of additional  municipal  securities,  increased  income in real estate
investment  trusts and bank owned life  insurance,  and tax valuation  allowance
adjustments.

Subsequent Events

On January 23, 2002, the Board of Directors  declared a $0.31 per share dividend
payable on February 15, 2002, to shareholders of record as of February 1, 2002.

On February 28, 2002, the Corporation consummated its acquisition of 100% of the
outstanding  common  shares of Signal,  a financial  holding  company  with $1.1
billion in assets at December 31, 2001.  As the  transaction  was  accounted for
under the purchase method,  the results of operations of Signal will be included
by the Corporation  beginning on the consummation  date, and therefore,  are not
included in the accompanying  consolidated  financial statements.  See Note 2 of
the notes to  consolidated  financial  consolidated  statements  for  additional
details of the Signal transaction.

These subsequent events have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

Future Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," ("SFAS 144") which supersedes both SFAS No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of," ("SFAS 121") and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB
Opinion No. 30,  "Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of
Disposal  of  a  Segment  of  a  Business,   and  Extraordinary,   Unusual,  and
Infrequently  Occurring Events and  Transactions," for the disposal of a segment
of a business.  SFAS 144 addresses  financial  accounting  and reporting for the
impairment  or disposal of  long-lived  assets.  This  Statement  requires  that
long-lived  assets be  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events or changes in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  may  not  be
recoverable.  Recoverability  of  assets  to be held and used is  measured  by a
comparison of the carrying  amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset.  If the  carrying  amount of an asset  exceeds its
estimated  future cash flows, an impairment  charge is recognized for the amount
by which the carrying  amount of the asset  exceeds the fair value of the asset.
SFAS 144 requires  companies to separately  report  discontinued  operations and
extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed
of (by sale,  abandonment,  or in a distribution  to owners) or is classified as
held for  sale.  Assets  to be  disposed  of are  reported  at the  lower of the
carrying  amount or fair value,  less costs to sell. The Corporation is required
to adopt SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002. Management does not expect the adoption of
SFAS 144 to have a material impact on the Corporation's financial statements.

In June 2001,  the FASB  issued SFAS No. 141,  "Business  Combinations,"  ("SFAS
141") and SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets," ("SFAS 142").
For  a  detailed   discussion  of  these  statements,   see  "Recent  Accounting
Pronouncements" under Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The  accounting  and  reporting   policies  of  Associated   Banc-Corp  and  its
subsidiaries  (the  "Corporation")  conform to accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in the United  States of America  and to general  practice  within the
financial  services  industry.  The  following  is a  description  of  the  more
significant of those policies.

Business

The Corporation  provides a full range of banking and related financial services
to individual  and corporate  customers  through its network of bank and nonbank
affiliates.  The Corporation is subject to competition  from other financial and
non-financial   institutions  that  offer  similar  or  competing  products  and
services. The Corporation is regulated by federal and state banking agencies and
undergoes periodic examinations by those agencies.

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Corporation
and subsidiaries,  all of which are wholly-owned.  All significant  intercompany
balances and  transactions  have been  eliminated in  consolidation.  Results of
operations of companies  purchased  are included  from the date of  acquisition.
Certain amounts in the 2000 and 1999 consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the 2001 presentation.

In preparing the consolidated  financial  statements,  management is required to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities  as of the date of the balance  sheet and  revenues and expenses for
the period.  Actual  results could differ  significantly  from those  estimates.
Estimates that are  particularly  susceptible to significant  change include the
determination  of the  allowance  for loan  losses,  income  taxes and  mortgage
servicing rights.

Investment Securities

Securities are classified as held to maturity, available for sale, or trading at
the time of purchase. In 2001 and 2000, all securities purchased were classified
as available  for sale.  Investment  securities  classified as held to maturity,
which  management has the positive  intent and ability to hold to maturity,  are
reported at amortized cost,  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion
of discounts,  using a method that approximates  level yield. The amortized cost
of debt  securities  classified  as held to  maturity or  available  for sale is
adjusted for  amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to the earlier
of call date or maturity,  or in the case of mortgage-related  securities,  over
the estimated life of the security.  Such amortization and accretion is included
in interest  income from the related  security.  Available  for sale and trading
securities are reported at fair value with unrealized  gains and losses,  net of
related deferred income taxes,  included in  stockholders'  equity as a separate
component of other comprehensive income. Realized securities gains or losses and
declines in value judged to be other than  temporary  are included in investment
securities  gains (losses),  net in the consolidated  statements of income.  The
cost of  securities  sold is based on the specific  identification  method.  Any
security for which there has been other than  temporary  impairment  of value is
written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to earnings.

Loans

Loans and leases are carried at the  principal  amount  outstanding,  net of any
unearned  income.  Unearned  income from direct  leases is recognized on a basis
that  generally   approximates  a  level  yield  on  the  outstanding   balances
receivable.  Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred  and the net  amount  is  amortized  over the  contractual  life of the
related loans or over the commitment period as an adjustment of yield.

                                       45

<PAGE>

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when  contractually  past due 90
days  or more as to  interest  or  principal  payments.  Additionally,  whenever
management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the
collectibility of principal or interest on loans, it is management's practice to
place such loans on  nonaccrual  status  immediately,  rather than delaying such
action  until  the  loans  become  90 days  past  due.  Previously  accrued  and
uncollected  interest on such loans is  reversed,  amortization  of related loan
fees is  suspended,  and income is  recorded  only to the extent  that  interest
payments are  subsequently  received in cash and a  determination  has been made
that the principal balance of the loan is collectible.  If collectibility of the
principal  is in doubt,  payments  received  are  applied to loan  principal.  A
nonaccrual  loan is returned  to accrual  status  when the  obligation  has been
brought  current  and  the  ultimate  collectibility  of the  total  contractual
principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market as determined on
an  aggregate  basis and  generally  consist  of current  production  of certain
fixed-rate first mortgage loans. Holding costs are treated as period costs.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is a reserve for estimated  credit losses.  Actual
credit  losses,  net of  recoveries,  are deducted  from the  allowance for loan
losses.  A provision for loan losses,  which is a charge  against  earnings,  is
added to bring the allowance  for loan losses to a level that,  in  management's
judgment, is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio.

The allocation  methodology  applied by the Corporation,  designed to assess the
adequacy of the  allowance  for loan losses,  focuses on changes in the size and
character  of the loan  portfolio,  changes  in  levels  of  impaired  and other
nonperforming  loans,  historical  losses on each portfolio  category,  the risk
inherent in specific  loans,  concentrations  of loans to specific  borrowers or
industries,   existing  economic  conditions,   the  fair  value  of  underlying
collateral,  and other  factors  which could  affect  potential  credit  losses.
Management  continues to target and maintain the allowance for loan losses equal
to the  allocation  methodology  plus an unallocated  portion,  as determined by
economic  conditions  and  other  factors,   on  the  Corporation's   borrowers.
Management  allocates  the  allowance  for loan  losses  by  pools of risk.  The
commercial   loan   (commercial   real  estate;   commercial,   financial,   and
agricultural;  leases;  and real estate  construction)  allocation is based on a
quarterly review of individual  loans,  loan types,  and industries.  The retail
loan (residential real estate, home equity, and consumer) allocation is based on
analysis of historical delinquency and charge-off statistics and trends. Minimum
loss  factors  used  by the  Corporation  for  criticized  loan  categories  are
consistent with regulatory agency factors.  Loss factors for non-criticized loan
categories are based primarily on historical loan loss experience.

Management,  considering current information and events regarding the borrowers'
ability to repay their  obligations,  considers a loan to be impaired when it is
probable  that the  Corporation  will be  unable  to  collect  all  amounts  due
according to the contractual  terms of the note agreement,  including  principal
and  interest.  Management  has  determined  that  commercial,   financial,  and
agricultural  loans and  commercial  real  estate  loans that have a  nonaccrual
status or have had their terms  restructured meet this definition.  Large groups
of  homogeneous  loans,  such as mortgage  and  consumer  loans and leases,  are
collectively  evaluated  for  impairment.  The amount of  impairment is measured
based upon the loan's  observable  market price, the estimated fair value of the
collateral for collateral-dependent  loans, or alternatively,  the present value
of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective  interest rate.
Interest  income on impaired loans is recorded when cash is received and only if
principal is considered to be fully collectible.

Management  believes  that the  allowance  for loan  losses is  adequate.  While
management  uses  available  information  to recognize  losses on loans,  future
additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary  based on changes in
economic conditions.  In addition,  various regulatory agencies,  as an integral
part  of  their  examination  process,  periodically  review  the  Corporation's
allowance  for loan  losses.  Such  agencies  may

                                       46

<PAGE>

require the Corporation to recognize  additions to the allowance for loan losses
based on their  judgments  about  information  available  to them at the time of
their examinations.

Other Real Estate Owned

Other real estate owned is included in other assets in the consolidated  balance
sheets and is comprised of property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or
acceptance  of  a  deed-in-lieu   of  foreclosure,   and  loans   classified  as
in-substance  foreclosure.  Other real estate  owned is recorded at the lower of
recorded investment in the loans at the time of acquisition or the fair value of
the  properties,  less estimated  selling costs.  Any write-down in the carrying
value of a property at the time of  acquisition  is charged to the allowance for
loan losses. Any subsequent write-downs to reflect current fair market value, as
well as gains and losses on  disposition  and revenues and expenses  incurred in
maintaining  such  properties,  are recorded  directly to the income  statement.
Other real estate  owned  totaled  $2.7 million and $4.0 million at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and  equipment  are stated at cost less  accumulated  depreciation  and
amortization.  Depreciation and  amortization are computed on the  straight-line
method over the estimated  useful lives of the related assets or the lease term.
Maintenance  and repairs are charged to expense as incurred,  while additions or
major  improvements  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful
lives.  Estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets  are 3 to 20  years  for  land
improvements,  5 to 40 years for buildings, 3 to 5 years for computers, and 3 to
20 years for furniture, fixtures and other equipment. Leasehold improvements are
amortized  on a straight  line  basis over the lesser of the lease  terms or the
estimated useful lives of the improvements.

Intangibles

The  excess  of the  purchase  price  over  the  fair  value  of net  assets  of
subsidiaries   acquired   consists   primarily  of  goodwill  and  core  deposit
intangibles that are being amortized on straight-line  and accelerated  methods.
These  intangibles  are  included in other  assets in the  consolidated  balance
sheets.  Goodwill is amortized to operating  expense over periods up to 40 years
for  acquisitions  made  before  1983  and  for  periods  up  to  25  years  for
acquisitions  made after 1982.  Core  deposit  intangibles  are  amortized on an
accelerated  basis to expense  over  periods of 7 to 10 years.  The  Corporation
reviews  long-lived assets and certain  identifiable  intangibles for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be  recoverable,  in which case an  impairment  charge would be
recorded. Goodwill and deposit base intangibles outstanding,  net of accumulated
amortization,  at  December  31,  2001 and 2000 were  $98.3  million  and $106.7
million, respectively.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Mortgage  servicing  rights  capitalized are amortized in proportion to and over
the period of estimated servicing income.  Capitalized mortgage servicing rights
are included in other assets. The total cost of loans originated or purchased is
allocated  between loans and servicing  rights based on the relative fair values
of each.  The value of mortgage  servicing  rights is  adversely  affected  when
mortgage  interest  rates  decline  and  mortgage  loan  prepayments   increase.
Impairment is assessed using  stratifications  based on the risk characteristics
of the underlying  loans, such as bulk acquisitions  versus  loan-by-loan,  loan
type,  and  interest  rate.  To the extent the  carrying  value of the  mortgage
servicing rights exceed their fair value, a valuation reserve is established.

Income Taxes

Amounts  provided  for  income  tax  expense  are based on income  reported  for
financial statement purposes and do not necessarily  represent amounts currently
payable under tax laws.  Deferred  income taxes,  which arise  principally  from
temporary  differences  between the period in which certain  income and expenses
are  recognized for financial  accounting  purposes and the period in which they
affect taxable income, are included in the amounts provided for income taxes. In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether
it is more likely than not that some  portion or all of the  deferred tax assets
will not be

                                       47

<PAGE>

realized.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those  temporary
differences  become deductible.  Management  considers the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax  liabilities,  projected  future taxable  income,  and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable
income and  projections  for future  taxable  income  over the period  which the
deferred tax assets are deductible,  management  believes it is more likely than
not the Corporation will realize the benefits of these  deductible  differences,
net of the existing valuation allowances at December 31, 2001.

The  Corporation  files a consolidated  federal income tax return and individual
subsidiary state income tax returns. Accordingly,  amounts equal to tax benefits
of those  subsidiaries  having  taxable  federal losses or credits are offset by
other subsidiaries that incur federal tax liabilities.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 133,  "Accounting for
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities,"  as amended by SFAS No. 138,
"Accounting for Certain Derivative  Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,"
(collectively  referred  to as  "SFAS  133")  requires  derivative  instruments,
including derivative  instruments embedded in other contracts,  to be carried at
fair value on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recorded directly
in earnings.  As required,  the Corporation adopted SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001.
In  accordance  with the  transition  provisions  of SFAS 133, upon adoption the
Corporation  recorded  a  cumulative  effect  of $1.3  million,  net of taxes of
$843,000,  in accumulated other comprehensive  income to recognize at fair value
all  derivatives  that are  designated  as cash flow hedge  instruments.  Due to
immateriality,  net gains on  derivatives  designated  as fair value hedges were
recorded in earnings at adoption.

All derivatives are recognized on the  consolidated  balance sheet at their fair
value.  On the date the  derivative  contract is entered into,  the  Corporation
designates the  derivative,  except for mortgage  banking  derivatives for which
changes in fair value of the  derivative  is recorded in  earnings,  as either a
fair  value  hedge  (i.e.  a hedge of the fair  value of a  recognized  asset or
liability) or a cash flow hedge (i.e. a hedge of the  variability  of cash flows
to be  received  or paid  related  to a  recognized  asset  or  liability).  The
Corporation formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedging  items,  as well as its  risk  management  objective  and  strategy  for
undertaking  various  hedge  transactions.  This  process  includes  linking all
derivatives  that are  designated  as fair value  hedges or cash flow  hedges to
specific  assets or  liabilities  on the balance  sheet.  The  Corporation  also
formally  assesses,  both at the  hedge's  inception  and on an  ongoing  basis,
whether  the  derivatives  that  are used in  hedging  transactions  are  highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If
it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it
has ceased to be a highly effective hedge,  the Corporation  discontinues  hedge
accounting prospectively.

For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value
of the  derivative  and of the hedged item  attributable  to the hedged risk are
recognized  in earnings.  If the  derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge,
the  effective  portions  of  changes in the fair  value of the  derivative  are
recorded  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  are  recognized  in the  income
statement when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes
in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

The  Corporation   discontinues  hedge  accounting   prospectively  when  it  is
determined that the derivative is no longer  effective in offsetting  changes in
the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item,  the  derivative  expires or is
sold,  terminated,  or exercised,  the derivative is  dedesignated  as a hedging
instrument,  or management  determines  that  designation of the derivative as a
hedging  instrument  is  no  longer   appropriate.   When  hedge  accounting  is
discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as
an effective fair value hedge, the Corporation continues to carry the derivative
on the balance sheet at its fair value,  and no longer  adjusts the hedged asset
or liability for changes in fair value. The adjustment of the carrying amount of
the hedged  asset or  liability  is  accounted  for in the same  manner as other
components of the carrying amount of that asset or liability.

For the year ended  December  31,  2000,  prior to the adoption of SFAS 133, the
Corporation  entered into interest  rate swap  agreements to hedge market values
and  to  alter  the  cash  flow  characteristics  of  certain  on-balance  sheet
instruments.  The  interest  rate  swaps are  linked  with a  specific  asset or
liability or a group of

                                       48

<PAGE>

related assets or  liabilities  at the inception of the derivative  contract and
have a high degree of correlation with the related balance sheet item during the
hedge  period.  Net  interest  income or expense on the  interest  rate swap was
recorded in the  consolidated  statements  of income as a component  of interest
income or interest  expense  depending on the financial  instrument to which the
swap is  designated.  Realized  gains or losses on contracts,  either settled or
terminated,  are  deferred  and are  recorded  as  either an  adjustment  to the
carrying  value of the related  on-balance  sheet asset or liability or in other
assets or other liabilities. Deferred amounts are amortized into interest income
or expense over either the remaining original life of the derivative  instrument
or the expected  life of the related  asset or  liability.  Unrealized  gains or
losses on these contracts were not recognized on the balance sheet.

Stock-Based Compensation

As allowed  under  SFAS 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,"  the
Corporation measures stock-based compensation cost in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB
Opinion No. 25). The  Corporation has included in Note 11 the impact of the fair
value of employee stock-based  compensation plans on net income and earnings per
share on a pro forma basis.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For  purposes  of the  consolidated  statements  of cash  flows,  cash  and cash
equivalents are considered to include cash and due from banks,  interest-bearing
deposits in other financial institutions,  and federal funds sold and securities
purchased  under  agreements to resell.  Cash and cash  equivalents  were $605.4
million  and $396.5  million at  December  31,  2001,  and  December  31,  2000,
respectively.

Per Share Computations

Basic  earnings  per share is  calculated  by dividing  net income  available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted  earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares adjusted for the dilutive  effect of outstanding  stock
options. Also see Notes 11 and 19.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001,  the FASB  issued SFAS No. 141,  "Business  Combinations,"  ("SFAS
141") and SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets," ("SFAS 142").
SFAS 141  requires  that  the  purchase  method  of  accounting  be used for all
business  combinations.  SFAS 141 also specifies criteria that intangible assets
acquired  in a business  combination  must meet to be  recognized  and  reported
separately  from  goodwill.  SFAS 142 will require that goodwill and  intangible
assets with indefinite  useful lives no longer be amortized,  but instead tested
for impairment at least annually in accordance  with the provisions of SFAS 142.
SFAS 142 also requires that  intangible  assets with  estimable  useful lives be
amortized  over  their  respective  estimated  useful  lives to their  estimated
residual  values,  and reviewed for impairment in accordance  with SFAS No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of," and subsequently,  SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," after its adoption.

The Corporation  adopted the provisions of SFAS 141 as of July 1, 2001, and SFAS
142 as of January 1, 2002.  Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an
indefinite  useful life acquired in a purchase  business  combination  completed
after June 30, 2001,  but before SFAS 142 is adopted in full, are not amortized.
Goodwill  and  intangible  assets  acquired in business  combinations  completed
before July 1, 2001,  continued to be amortized and tested for impairment  prior
to the full adoption of SFAS 142.

Upon adoption of SFAS 142, the  Corporation is required to evaluate its existing
intangible   assets  and  goodwill  that  were  acquired  in  purchase  business
combinations,  and to make any necessary  reclassifications  in order to conform
with the new classification  criteria in SFAS 141 for recognition  separate from
goodwill. The Corporation will also be required to reassess the useful lives and
residual  values  of all  intangible  assets

                                       49

<PAGE>

acquired,  and make any necessary  amortization period adjustments by the end of
the first interim period after adoption. If an intangible asset is identified as
having an indefinite  useful life, the Corporation  will be required to test the
intangible  asset for  impairment in accordance  with the provisions of SFAS 142
within the first  interim  period.  Impairment  is measured as the excess of the
carrying  value over the fair value of an  intangible  asset with an  indefinite
life.  Any  impairment  loss will be  measured  as of the date of  adoption  and
recognized as the cumulative  effect of a change in accounting  principle in the
first interim period.

In connection with the SFAS 142 transitional goodwill impairment evaluation, the
Statement  requires the Corporation to perform an assessment of whether there is
an  indication  that  goodwill  is  impaired  as of the  date  of  adoption.  To
accomplish this, the Corporation must identify its reporting units and determine
the  carrying  value  of  each  reporting  unit  by  assigning  the  assets  and
liabilities,  including the existing  goodwill and intangible  assets,  to those
reporting units as of January 1, 2002. The Corporation  will then have up to six
months from January 1, 2002, to determine the fair value of each  reporting unit
and compare it to the carrying  amount of the reporting  unit. To the extent the
carrying  amount of a reporting  unit  exceeds  the fair value of the  reporting
unit, an indication  exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and
the  Corporation  must  perform the second step of the  transitional  impairment
test.  The second step is required to be completed  as soon as possible,  but no
later than the end of the year of adoption.  In the second step, the Corporation
must  compare the implied fair value of the  reporting  unit  goodwill  with the
carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill,  both of which would be measured
as of the date of adoption.  The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by
allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets (recognized
and unrecognized) and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a
purchase price allocation,  in accordance with SFAS 141. The residual fair value
after this  allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.
Any transitional  impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle in the Corporation's statement of income.

As of January 1, 2002,  the date of adoption of SFAS 142,  the  Corporation  had
unamortized goodwill in the amount of $92.4 million, of which $85.7 million will
be  subject  to the  transition  provisions  of SFAS 142 and $6.7  million  will
continue  to be  amortized  as  an  identifiable  intangible  asset  subject  to
amortization.  Also,  at January  1,  2002,  the  Corporation  had core  deposit
intangibles,  of $5.9  million  which  will  continue  to be  amortized.  Annual
amortization  expense  related to the core deposit  intangibles was $1.9 million
and $2.3 million for 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Amortization expense related
to goodwill was $6.5  million and $6.6 million for the years ended  December 31,
2001,  and 2000,  respectively.  Because  of the  effort  needed to comply  with
adopting SFAS 142, it is not  practicable  to reasonably  estimate the impact of
adopting the Statements on the Corporation's financial statements at the date of
this report, including whether it will be required to recognize any transitional
impairment losses as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

NOTE 2 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:

There were no business  combinations  during 2000 or 2001.  The following  table
summarizes  completed  transactions  during 1999. Each acquisition was accounted
for under the purchase  method,  thus, the results of their  operations prior to
their  respective  consummation  dates  are  not  included  in the  accompanying
consolidated financial statements. Goodwill, core deposit intangibles, and other
purchase  accounting  adjustments  are recorded upon  consummation of a purchase
acquisition  where the  purchase  price  exceeds  the fair  value of net  assets
acquired.

</TABLE>

(a)  During the first quarter of 2000,  Riverside and Windsor  merged and became
     Associated Bank Minnesota.

On December 31, 1999,  the  Corporation  completed  its  acquisition  of BNC, an
asset-based  commercial lender  headquartered in St. Cloud,  Minnesota.  BNC had
assets of approximately $35 million at December 31, 1999. The purchase price was
$5.3 million in cash and goodwill of $1.2 million was recorded.  BNC operates as
a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of the  Corporation.  Effective  March 31, 2000, BNC
operated as Associated Commercial Finance, Inc.

On August 31, 1999, the Corporation  completed its  acquisition of Riverside,  a
Minnesota bank holding company for Riverside Bank. Riverside had total assets of
approximately  $374 million upon  consummation.  The  transaction  was completed
through the issuance of 2,677,405 shares of common stock, which were repurchased
and retired during 1999 under authorization by the Board of Directors.  Goodwill
of $60.6 million and a core deposit intangible of $5.9 million were recorded.

On February 3, 1999, the Corporation  consummated the acquisition of Windsor,  a
Minnesota bank holding  company for Bank Windsor.  At  consummation  Windsor had
total assets of  approximately  $182 million.  The  transaction  was consummated
through the issuance of 879,957 shares of common stock,  which were  repurchased
and retired under  authorization  by the Board of  Directors.  Goodwill of $17.4
million was recorded.

On September  10, 2001,  the  Corporation  announced the signing of a definitive
agreement to acquire Signal.  Signal operates banking branches in nine locations
in the Twin Cities and Eastern  Minnesota.  As a result of the acquisition,  the
Corporation expects to expand its Minnesota  presence,  particularly in the Twin
Cities  area,  under  the  community  banking  philosophy  utilized  by both the
Corporation  and Signal.  It also expects to reduce costs through  efficiencies,
particularly  following  the merger  planned  in the  second  quarter of 2002 of
Signal's  banking  subsidiaries  with and into  Associated  Bank  Minnesota,  to
operate under a single national banking charter named Associated Bank Minnesota,
National  Association.  In 2002 the  Corporation  consummated its acquisition of
100% of the  outstanding  common  shares  of  Signal  Financial  Corporation,  a
financial   holding  company   headquartered  in  Mendota   Heights,   Minnesota
("Signal").

The Signal  transaction was accounted for under the purchase  accounting  method
and was consummated  through the issuance of 3.69 million shares of common stock
and $58.4 million in cash for a purchase price of $192.5  million.  The value of
the shares was  determined  using the closing  stock price of the  Corporation's
stock on September 10, 2001, the initiation date of the transaction.

The  intangible  asset  represents  $5.6  million  estimated as the core deposit
intangible asset. The $123.4 million of goodwill will be assigned to the banking
segment during first quarter 2002, as part of the adoption of SFAS 142.

NOTE 3 RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS:

The Corporation's  bank subsidiaries are required to maintain certain vault cash
and reserve  balances  with the Federal  Reserve Bank to meet  specific  reserve
requirements.  These  requirements  approximated  $109.4 million at December 31,
2001.

The  Corporation  serves the credit  needs of its  customers  by offering a wide
variety of loan programs to customers,  primarily in  Wisconsin,  Illinois,  and
Minnesota.  The loan  portfolio  is widely  diversified  by types of  borrowers,
industry  groups,  and  market  areas.   Significant  loan   concentrations  are
considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to
a multiple  number of borrowers  engaged in similar  activities that would cause
them to be similarly  impacted by economic or other conditions.  At December 31,
2001, no concentrations of any type existed in the Corporation's  loan portfolio
in excess of 10% of total loans.

The short-term Federal Home Loan Bank advances are secured by blanket collateral
agreements on the subsidiary banks' mortgage loan portfolios  whereby qualifying
mortgages (as defined) with unpaid principal  balances  aggregating no less than
167% of the Federal Home Loan Bank advances are maintained.

Included in  short-term  borrowings  are Federal  Home Loan Bank  advances  with
original maturities of less than one year. The treasury, tax, and loan notes are
demand  notes   representing   secured   borrowings  from  the  U.S.   Treasury,
collateralized by qualifying securities and loans.

Notes payable to banks are unsecured  borrowings under existing lines of credit.
At December 31, 2001, the parent  company had $100 million of established  lines
of credit with various  nonaffiliated  banks, which was not drawn on at December
31, 2001.  Borrowings  under these lines accrue  interest at  short-term  market
rates.  Under the terms of the  credit  agreement,  a variety  of  advances  and
interest  periods may be selected by the parent  company.  During  2000,  a $200
million  commercial paper program was initiated,  no amounts were outstanding at
December 31, 2001.

(1)  On April 4, 2001, the Corporation issued $200 million of variable rate bank
     notes that matures on April 10, 2003. The note reprices  quarterly at LIBOR
     plus 22 basis points and was 2.66% at December 31, 2001.

(2)  On August 6, 2001,  the  Corporation  issued $200  million of  subordinated
     debt.  This debt has a fixed  interest  rate of 6.75% and matures on August
     15, 2011. During October,  the Corporation  entered into a fair value hedge
     to hedge the interest  rate risk on the  subordinated  debt. As of December
     31,  2001,  the fair  value of the  hedge  was a $16.7  million  loss.  The
     subordinated debt qualifies under the risk-based capital guidelines as Tier
     2 supplementary capital for regulatory purposes.

Note 11 Stockholders' Equity:

On June 15, 2000, the Corporation distributed 6.3 million shares of common stock
in connection  with a 10% stock dividend.  During 1999, the  Corporation  issued
shares in conjunction  with merger and  acquisition  activity (see Note 2 of the
notes to consolidated  financial  statements).  Share and price  information has
been adjusted to reflect all stock splits and dividends.

The  Corporation's  Articles of Incorporation  authorize the issuance of 750,000
shares of preferred stock at a par value of $1.00 per share. No shares have been
issued.

At December 31, 2001,  subsidiary  net assets  equaled  $1.1  billion,  of which
approximately $148.0 million could be transferred to the Corporation in the form
of cash  dividends  without prior  regulatory  approval,  subject to the capital
needs of each subsidiary.

The Board of Directors has  authorized  management  to repurchase  shares of the
Corporation's  common stock each quarter in the market, to be made available for
issuance in connection with the Corporation's  employee  incentive plans and for
other corporate purposes. The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up
to 1.2 million  shares  (300,000  shares per quarter) in 2001 and 2000. Of these
authorizations,  approximately 800,000 shares were repurchased for $26.7 million
during 2001 (with  247,000  shares  reissued in  connection  with stock  options
exercised),  and 418,000 shares were repurchased for $10.6 million in 2000 (with
322,000 shares reissued for options exercised). Additionally, under two separate
actions  in  2000,  the  Board  of  Directors   authorized  the  repurchase  and
cancellation   of  the   Corporation's   outstanding   shares,   not  to  exceed
approximately 6.7 million shares on a combined basis. Under these authorizations
228,000 shares were repurchased for $7.7 million during 2001, at an average cost
of $33.88 per share, while approximately 3.1 million shares remain authorized to
repurchase  at December  31,  2001.  The  repurchase  of shares will be based on
market  opportunities,  capital levels,  growth prospects,  and other investment
opportunities.

The Board of Directors approved the implementation of a broad-based stock option
grant,  effective July 28, 1999. This stock option grant provided all qualifying
employees with an opportunity  and an incentive to buy shares of the Corporation
and align their financial interest with the growth in value of the Corporation's
shares.  These  options have 10-year  terms,  fully vest in two years,  and have
exercise  prices  equal to 100% of  market  value on the  date of  grant.  As of
December 31, 2001, 1,620,000 shares remain available for granting.

The Amended and  Restated  Long-Term  Incentive  Stock Plan  ("Stock  Plan") was
adopted by the Board of Directors and  originally  approved by  shareholders  in
1987 and amended in 1994, 1997 and 1998. Options are generally exercisable up to
10 years from the date of grant and vest over two to three years. As of December
31, 2001, approximately 1,052,000 shares remain available for grants.

The  stock  incentive  plans  of  acquired  companies  were  terminated  at each
respective   merger  date.   Option   holders  under  such  plans  received  the
Corporation's  common stock, or options to buy the  Corporation's  common stock,
based on the conversion terms of the various merger  agreements.  The historical
option  information  presented  below has been  restated  to reflect the options
originally granted under the acquired companies' plans.

For purposes of providing the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123,
the fair value of stock options granted in 2001, 2000, and 1999 was estimated at
the  date  of  grant  using a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  which  was
originally  developed  for use in  estimating  the fair value of traded  options
which have  different  characteristics  from the  Corporation's  employee  stock
options.  The model is also sensitive to changes in the  subjective  assumptions
which can materially  affect the fair value  estimate.  As a result,  management
believes the Black-Scholes  model may not necessarily  provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of employee stock options.

The following  assumptions  were used in  estimating  the fair value for options
granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999:

                                        2001             2000          1999
                                      -----------------------------------------
Dividend yield                          3.51%            3.82%         3.39%
Risk-free interest rate                 5.09%            6.63%         4.97%
Weighted average expected life         7 yrs.             yrs.       50 yrs.
Expected volatility                    26.07%           25.73%        24.51%

The weighted average per share fair values of options granted in 2001, 2000, and
1999 were $7.76, $6.97, and $6.90,  respectively.  The annual expense allocation
methodology  prescribed  by SFAS No. 123  attributes a higher  percentage of the
reported  expense  to  earlier  years  than  to  later  years,  resulting  in an
accelerated expense recognition for proforma disclosure purposes.

NOTE 12 RETIREMENT PLAN:

The  Corporation  has a  noncontributory  defined  benefit  retirement plan (the
"Plan") covering  substantially all full-time employees.  The benefits are based
primarily  on years of  service  and the  employee's  compensation  paid while a
participant in the plan. The Corporation's funding policy is consistent with the
funding requirements of federal law and regulations.

The following tables set forth the Plan's funded status and net periodic benefit
cost:

The  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries  also  have a Profit  Sharing/Retirement
Savings Plan (the "plan"). The Corporation's contribution is determined annually
by the  Administrative  Committee  of the Board of  Directors,  based in part on
performance-based  formulas  provided  in the plan.  Total  expense  related  to
contributions to the plan was $10.5 million,  $6.1 million,  and $2.3 million in
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

At December 31, 2001, the Corporation  recorded an additional pension obligation
of $4.2  million,  of  which,  $2.2  million  was  included  as a  reduction  in
accumulated  other  comprehensive  income,  net of  taxes of $1.5  million,  and
$500,000 was included as an intangible asset. An additional  pension  obligation
is required when the accumulated  benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair
value of plan assets and the accrued pension expense.

</TABLE>

Components  of the 2000  deferred  tax assets have been  adjusted to reflect the
filing of corporate income tax returns.

For financial reporting  purposes,  a valuation allowance has been recognized to
offset deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss  carryforwards of
certain subsidiaries and other temporary differences due to the uncertainty that
the assets will be  realized.  If it is  subsequently  determined  that all or a
portion of these deferred tax assets will be realized, the tax benefit for these
items will be used to reduce current tax expense for that period.

At December 31, 2001,  the  Corporation  had state net operating  losses of $170
million and federal net  operating  losses of $2 million that will expire in the
years 2002 through 2016.

</TABLE>

A savings bank acquired by the Corporation in 1997 qualified under provisions of
the  Internal  Revenue Code that  permitted it to deduct from taxable  income an
allowance for bad debts that differed from the provision for such losses charged
to income for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, no provision for income
taxes has been made for $79.2  million of retained  income at December 31, 2001.
If income taxes had been  provided,  the deferred tax liability  would have been
approximately $31.8 million.

NOTE 14 COMMITMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES:

Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Risk

The Corporation is a party to financial  instruments with off-balance sheet risk
in the normal  course of business to meet the  financing  needs of its customers
and  to  manage  its  own  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk.  These  financial
instruments include lending-related commitments.

Lending-related Commitments

Off-balance  sheet  lending-related  commitments  include  commitments to extend
credit,  commercial  letters of credit,  and  standby  letters of credit.  These
financial  instruments are exercisable at the market rate prevailing at the date
the  underlying  transaction  will be completed,  and thus are deemed to have no
current  fair  value,  or the fair value is based on fees  currently  charged to
enter into similar agreements and is not material at December 31, 2001 and 2000.
Commitments   to  extend   credit  are   agreements  to  lend  to  customers  at
predetermined  interest  rates as long as there is no violation of any condition
established  in the  contracts.  Standby  and  commercial  letters of credit are
conditional  commitments  issued by the Corporation to guarantee the performance
and/or  payment of a customer  to a third  party in  connection  with  specified
transactions.  The following is a summary of  lending-related  off-balance sheet
financial instruments at December 31:

                                                       2001           2000
                                                   ----------     ----------
                                                      ($ in Thousands)

Commitments to extend credit                       $3,189,013     $2,596,438
Commercial letters of credit                           79,980         45,248
Standby letters of credit                             189,996        145,321
Loans sold with recourse                                1,941          4,575
Forward commitments to sell loans                     650,500         52,350

For  commitments to extend  credit,  commercial  letters of credit,  and standby
letters of credit the  Corporation's  associated  credit risk is essentially the
same as that  involved in extending  loans to customers and is subject to normal
credit  policies.  The  Corporation's  exposure  to credit  loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to these financial  instruments is represented
by the contractual amount of those instruments.  The commitments  generally have
fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a
fee. The  Corporation  uses the same credit  policies in making  commitments and
conditional  obligations  as  it  does  for  on-balance-sheet  instruments.  The
Corporation evaluates each customer's  creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
The amount of collateral  obtained,  if deemed necessary by the Corporation upon
extension of

                                       64

credit, is based on management's  credit evaluation of the customer.  Since many
of the  commitments  are expected to expire  without being drawn upon, the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

All loans  currently  sold to others  are sold on a  nonrecourse  basis with the
servicing  rights of these loans  retained by the  Corporation.  At December 31,
2001 and 2000,  $1.9  million and $4.6  million,  respectively,  of the serviced
loans  were  previously  sold with  recourse,  the  majority  of which is either
federally-insured or federally-guaranteed.

As a result of the adoption of SFAS 133,  commitments  to originate  residential
mortgage loans held for sale and commitments to sell residential  mortgage loans
are defined as  derivatives,  and are  therefore  required to be recorded on the
consolidated  balance  sheet at fair value.  The  Corporation's  derivative  and
hedging  activity,  as defined by SFAS 133, is further  summarized in Note 15 of
the notes to  consolidated  financial  statements.  Included in  commitments  to
extend  credit  in the table  above are  commitments  to  originate  residential
mortgage loans held for sale ("pipeline loans") of approximately  $590.8 million
and $55.2  million,  at  December  31, 2001 and 2000,  respectively,  with terms
generally not exceeding 90 days.  Adverse market  interest rate changes  between
the time a customer  receives a  rate-lock  commitment  and the time the loan is
sold to an  investor  can  erode  the  value of that  mortgage.  Therefore,  the
Corporation  uses forward  commitments  to sell  residential  mortgage  loans to
reduce its  exposure to market risk  resulting  from  changes in interest  rates
which could alter the underlying  fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and
pipeline loans. The fair value of the pipeline loans and the forward commitments
at December  31,  2001 and 2000,  was a net gain of $4.1  million  and  $12,000,
respectively.  Also,  the  Corporation  had $301.7  million and $24.6 million of
mortgage loans held for sale in the consolidated  balance sheets at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. The mortgage loans held for sale are carried in the
consolidated  balance sheet at the lower of cost or fair value,  with fair value
determined  based on the fixed  prices  of the  forward  commitments,  or quoted
market prices on uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale.

Contingent Liabilities

There  are  legal  proceedings  pending  against  certain  subsidiaries  of  the
Corporation in the ordinary  course of their  business.  Although  litigation is
subject to many  uncertainties  and the ultimate  exposure with respect to these
matters cannot be ascertained,  management believes, based upon discussions with
legal counsel, that the Corporation has meritorious  defenses,  and any ultimate
liability would not have a material adverse affect on the consolidated financial
position or results of operations of the Corporation.

NOTE 15 DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:

Effective  January 1, 2001, the Corporation  adopted SFAS 133, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative  instruments  embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities.
All  derivatives,  whether  designated  in  hedging  relationships  or not,  are
required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is
designated  as a fair  value  hedge,  the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of the
derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized
in earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective
portions of changes in the fair value of the  derivative  are  recorded in other
comprehensive  income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged
item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash
flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

The Corporation uses derivative  instruments  primarily to hedge the variability
in  interest  payments or protect  the value of certain  assets and  liabilities
recorded in its  consolidated  balance sheet from changes in interest rates. The
contract or notional amount of a derivative is used to determine, along with the
other  terms  of  the  derivative,  the  amounts  to be  exchanged  between  the
counterparties.  Because  the  contract or  notional  amount does not  represent
amounts  exchanged by the parties,  it is not a measure of loss exposure related
to the use of derivatives  nor of exposure to liquidity risk. The Corporation is
exposed  to credit  risk in the event of  nonperformance  by  counterparties  to
financial  instruments.  As the Corporation  generally enters into  transactions
only  with  high   quality   counterparties,   no   losses   with   counterparty
nonperformance on derivative  financial

                                       65

instruments has occurred.  Further,  the Corporation obtains collateral and uses
master netting  arrangements  when  available.  To mitigate  counterparty  risk,
interest rate swap agreements  generally contain language  outlining  collateral
pledging requirements for each counterparty.  Collateral must be posted when the
market value exceeds a certain  threshold.  The threshold  limits are determined
from the credit  ratings of each  counterparty.  Upgrades or  downgrades  to the
credit ratings of either counterparty would lower or raise the threshold limits.
Market risk is the adverse  effect on the value of a financial  instrument  that
results from a change in interest rates,  currency  exchange rates, or commodity
prices.  The market risk  associated  with interest rate contracts is managed by
establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market
risk that may be undertaken.

Interest rate swap  contracts are entered into  primarily as an  asset/liability
management  strategy to reduce interest rate risk.  Interest rate swap contracts
are  exchanges of interest  payments,  such as fixed rate  payments for floating
rate payments,  based on a notional  principal  amount.  Payments related to the
Corporation's swap contracts are made either monthly, quarterly or semi-annually
by one of the parties  depending on the specific terms of the related  contract.
The primary  risk  associated  with all swaps is the  exposure to  movements  in
interest  rates and the ability of the  counterparties  to meet the terms of the
contract.  At December 31, 2001,  the  Corporation  had $723 million of interest
rate swaps outstanding.  Included in this amount,  $123 million in interest rate
swaps were used to convert  fixed rate loans  into  floating  rate  assets.  The
remaining swap contracts used for interest rate risk  management of $600 million
at December 31, 2001,  were used to hedge  interest  rate risk of various  other
specific liabilities.

Interest  rate floors and caps are interest  rate  protection  instruments  that
involve  the payment  from the seller to the buyer of an interest  differential.
This differential  represents the difference between a short-term rate (e.g. six
month  LIBOR) and an agreed  upon rate (the strike  rate)  applied to a notional
principal  amount. By buying a cap the Corporation will be paid the differential
by a counterparty, should the short-term rate rise above the strike level of the
agreement.  The primary risk  associated  with purchased  floors and caps is the
ability of the counterparties to meet the terms of the agreement. As of December
31, 2001, the Corporation had purchased caps for  asset/liability  management of
$200 million.

The predominant  activities  affected by the statement include the Corporation's
use of interest rate swaps and certain mortgage banking activities. The adoption
of the statement included the following:

-    Under SFAS 133,  the  Corporation  was  allowed a one-time  opportunity  to
     reclassify  investment  securities  from held to maturity to available  for
     sale.  Thus, upon adoption,  the Corporation  reclassified  all its held to
     maturity  securities to available for sale  securities.  The amortized cost
     and fair value of the  securities  transferred  were $369  million and $373
     million, respectively.

-    The Corporation designated its interest rate swaps existing at December 31,
     2000,  to qualify for hedge  accounting.  These swaps hedge the exposure to
     variability in interest payments of variable rate liabilities. These hedges
     represent  cash flow  hedges and were  highly  effective  at  adoption.  On
     adoption,  the cumulative effect, net of taxes of $843,000, was recorded as
     a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of $1.3 million.

                                       66

<PAGE>

-    The Corporation's  commitments to sell groups of residential mortgage loans
     that it originates or purchases as part of its mortgage banking operations,
     as well as its  commitments  to originate  residential  mortgage  loans are
     considered  derivatives under SFAS 133. The fair value of these derivatives
     at adoption, a $12,000 net gain, was recorded in mortgage banking income.

In accordance with the statement,  the Corporation measures the effectiveness of
its hedges on a periodic basis. Any difference  between the fair value change of
the hedge  versus the fair value change of the hedged item is  considered  to be
the "ineffective"  portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge is
recorded  as  an  increase   or  decrease  in  the  related   income   statement
classification of the item being hedged. For the mortgage derivatives, which are
not  accounted  for as  hedges,  changes in the fair  value are  recorded  as an
adjustment to mortgage banking income.

At December 31, 2001,  the  estimated  fair value of the interest rate swaps and
the cap  designated as cash flow hedges was a $3.5 million  unrealized  loss, or
$2.1  million,  net  of  taxes  of  $1.4  million,  carried  as a  component  of
accumulated other  comprehensive  income. The ineffective  portion of the hedges
recorded through the statements of income was immaterial. Currently, none of the
existing amounts within accumulated other  comprehensive  income are expected to
be reclassified  into earnings within the next 12 months.  These instruments are
used to hedge the exposure to the  variability in interest  payments of variable
rate liabilities.

At December  31,  2001,  the  estimated  fair value of the  interest  rate swaps
designated as fair value hedges was an unrealized loss of $17.5 million, carried
as a component of other  liabilities.  These swaps hedge against  changes in the
fair value of certain loans and long term debt.

The change in fair value of the mortgage  derivatives since adoption of SFAS 133
was a net gain of $4.1  million and is recorded in mortgage  banking  income for
the year ended  December 31,  2001.  The $4.1 million net fair value of mortgage
derivatives  is composed of the net gain on  commitments  to sell  approximately
$650.5  million  of  loans  to  various   investors  and   commitments  to  fund
approximately $590.8 million of loans to individual borrowers.

At December 31, 2000, the Corporation  had the following  interest rate swaps to
hedge  interest  rate risk.  The effect on net  interest  income for 2000 was an
increase of $311,000.  The pay fixed swaps hedged money market  deposits and the
receive  rate was based on 3 month LIBOR,  while the pay  variable  swaps hedged
certificates of deposit and the rate was based on 3 month LIBOR.

</TABLE>

(1)  At December 31, 2001 and 2000,  the notional  amount of interest  rate swap
     and cap  agreements  was $923 million and $310 million,  respectively.  For
     2001, the interest rate swap agreements are carried in the balance sheet at
     fair value; for 2000, the swaps are off-balance  sheet. See Notes 14 and 15
     for information on the fair value of lending-related  off-balance sheet and
     derivative financial instruments.

Cash  and  due  from  banks,   interest-bearing   deposits  in  other  financial
institutions,  federal funds sold and securities  purchased under  agreements to
resell, and accrued interest receivable - For these short-term instruments,  the
carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Investment  securities  held to maturity,  investment  securities  available for
sale, and trading account  securities - The fair value of investment  securities
held to maturity,  investment securities available for sale, and trading account
securities, except certain state and municipal securities, is estimated based on
bid prices  published in financial  newspapers or bid  quotations  received from
securities dealers.  The fair value of certain state and municipal securities is
not readily  available through market sources other than dealer  quotations,  so
fair value  estimates are based on quoted market prices of similar  instruments,
adjusted for  differences  between the quoted  instruments  and the  instruments
being valued.  There were no trading account  securities at December 31, 2001 or
2000.

Loans  Held  for  Sale -  Fair  value  is  estimated  using  the  prices  of the
Corporation's  existing  commitments to sell such loans and/or the quoted market
prices for commitments to sell similar loans.

Loans - Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial
characteristics.  Loans are  segregated by type such as  commercial,  commercial
real estate,  residential  mortgage,  credit card, and other consumer.  The fair
value of other types of loans is estimated by discounting  the future cash flows
using the current rates at which  similar loans would be made to borrowers  with
similar  credit ratings and for similar  maturities.  Future cash flows are also
adjusted for estimated  reductions or delays due to delinquencies,  nonaccruals,
or potential charge-offs.

Deposits  - The  fair  value  of  deposits  with  no  stated  maturity  such  as
noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings,  interest-bearing demand deposits,
and  money  market  accounts,  is equal to the  amount  payable  on

                                       70

<PAGE>

demand as of December 31. The fair value of  certificates of deposit is based on
the discounted  value of contractual  cash flows. The discount rate is estimated
using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Accrued  interest  payable  and  short-term  borrowings  - For these  short-term
instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Long-term  debt - Rates  currently  available to the  Corporation  for debt with
similar  terms and  remaining  maturities  are used to  estimate  fair  value of
existing borrowings.

Interest rate swap and cap agreements - The fair value of interest rate swap and
cap  agreements  is obtained  from dealer  quotes.  These values  represent  the
estimated  amount  the  Corporation  would  receive  or  pay  to  terminate  the
agreements,  taking into account current  interest rates and, when  appropriate,
the current creditworthiness of the counter-parties.

Limitations - Fair value  estimates are made at a specific point in time,  based
on relevant market  information and information about the financial  instrument.
These  estimates  do not reflect any premium or discount  that could result from
offering for sale at one time the Corporation's  entire holdings of a particular
financial instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of the
Corporation's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments
regarding future expected loss experience,  current  economic  conditions,  risk
characteristics  of various  financial  instruments,  and other  factors.  These
estimates  are  subjective  in nature and involve  uncertainties  and matters of
significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.  Changes
in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

NOTE 18 REGULATORY MATTERS:

The  Corporation  and the  subsidiary  banks are  subject to various  regulatory
capital  requirements  administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to
meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain  mandatory--and  possibly
additional  discretionary--actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have
a direct  material  effect  on the  Corporation's  financial  statements.  Under
capital adequacy  guidelines and the regulatory  framework for prompt corrective
action,  the  Corporation  must meet specific  capital  guidelines  that involve
quantitative  measures of the  Corporation's  assets,  liabilities,  and certain
off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The
Corporation's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative
judgments  by the  regulators  about  components,  risk  weightings,  and  other
factors.

Quantitative  measures  established  by  regulation to ensure  capital  adequacy
require the Corporation to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the
table  below) of total and Tier I capital  (as  defined in the  regulations)  to
risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average
assets (as  defined).  Management  believes,  as of December 31, 2001,  that the
Corporation and the subsidiary banks meet all capital  adequacy  requirements to
which they are subject.

As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the most recent  notifications from the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
categorized  the  subsidiary  banks as well  capitalized  under  the  regulatory
framework for prompt  corrective  action.  To be categorized as well capitalized
the subsidiary banks must maintain minimum total risk-based,  Tier I risk-based,
and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or
events  since that  notification  that  management  believes  have  changed  the
institutions' category.

The actual capital  amounts and ratios of the  Corporation  and its  significant
subsidiaries  are  presented  below.  No  deductions  from capital were made for
interest rate risk in 2001 or 2000. The increase in the total risk-based capital
ratio for 2001 compared to 2000 is primarily  attributable  to the  subordinated
debt issued in 2001 which qualifies as Tier 2 supplementary capital.

NOTE 20 SEGMENT REPORTING

SFAS  No.  131,  "Disclosures  About  Segments  of  an  Enterprise  and  Related
Information,"  requires  selected  financial and descriptive  information  about
reportable  operating  segments.  The statement  replaces the "industry segment"
concept  of SFAS No. 14 with a  "management  approach"  concept as the basis for
identifying  reportable  segments.  The management  approach is based on the way
that  management  organizes  the  segments  within  the  enterprise  for  making
operating   decisions,   allocating   resources,   and  assessing   performance.
Consequently,  the segments are evident from the  structure of the  enterprise's
internal  organization,  focusing on financial  information that an enterprise's
chief operating  decision-makers  use to make decisions  about the  enterprise's
operating matters.

While the Corporation  continues developing a process toward evaluating business
lines and products across its  subsidiaries  through 2001,  management  decision
making has been and is still based on  financial  information  by legal  entity.
Each banking entity is empowered to make decisions that are  appropriate for its
customers and for the business environment of its communities.

The Corporation's  reportable segment is banking.  The Corporation  conducts its
banking  segment  through its bank and  mortgage  subsidiaries.  For purposes of
segment  disclosure  under this statement,  these entities have been combined as
one, given these segments have similar economic  characteristics  and the nature
of their  products,  services,  processes,  customers,  delivery  channels,  and
regulatory  environment are similar.  Banking  includes:  a) business  banking -
small  business and other  business  lending,  investment  management,  leasing,
business  deposits,  and a complement  of services such as cash  management  and
international  banking;  and b) retail banking - consumer,  mortgage,  and other
real estate lending, credit cards, and deposits.

The "other" segment is comprised of smaller  nonreportable  segments,  including
insurance,  brokerage services,  asset management,  consumer finance,  treasury,
holding company investments,  as well as inter-segment eliminations and residual
revenues and  expenses,  representing  the  difference  between  actual  amounts
incurred and the amounts allocated to operating segments.

                                       73

The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note
1. Selected segment information is presented below.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
ASSOCIATED BANC-CORP

The Board of Directors
Associated Banc-Corp:


We have  audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of  Associated
Banc-Corp  and  subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,  and the related
consolidated  statements of income,  changes in stockholders'  equity,  and cash
flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period ended  December 31, 2001.
These consolidated  financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Associated Banc-Corp
and  subsidiaries  as of December  31,  2001 and 2000,  and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period
ended  December 31, 2001 in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America.

                                  EXHIBIT 10(E)

                        INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AGREEMENT


     This Incentive  Compensation  Agreement  ("Agreement")  is made and entered
into as of this 1st day of October, 2001, by and between Associated Banc-Corp on
behalf of its  affiliates  and  subsidiaries,  (collectively  referred to as the
"Company"), and *Participant* ("Employee").

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"),  desiring (i)
to associate  more closely the interests of certain key employees  with those of
the  company's  financial,  performance,  and  service  goals,  (ii) to  provide
long-term  incentives  and rewards to those key employees of the Company and its
affiliated  units who are in a position to contribute  to the long-term  success
and growth of the  Company,  and (iii) to assist the  Company in  retaining  and
attracting key employees with requisite experience and ability.

     NOW  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the mutual  premises  and  covenants
contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby  acknowledged,
it is agreed as follows:

     I. Incentive Compensation

          A.   Incentive  Compensation  Governed  by  Terms of  Agreement.  This
               Incentive  Compensation  shall be payable only in accordance with
               the terms of this  Agreement.  Terms  defined in this  Agreement,
               where used herein, shall have the meanings as so defined.

          B.   Payment of Incentive  Compensation.  Incentive Compensation shall
               be paid, in accordance with and only upon  Employee's  completion
               of  the  achievement  of  goals  as  set  forth  in  Schedule  A.
               Compensation  amount will be determined based on target award set
               forth in Schedule B.

               No payment  shall be made until the terms and  conditions of this
               Agreement are satisfied.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  payment
               shall  be  made  immediately  upon a  Change  in  Control  in the
               Company,  as  defined  in  Section  II.A.4.  as  subject  to  the
               following:

               1.   Except as described  below,  in the event of the involuntary
                    termination of Employee's employment with the Company or its
                    affiliated units for cause (including  reasons  described in
                    I.B.4. below) or the Employee voluntarily terminates for any
                    reason  (other  than  that as  described  in  II.B.  below),
                    Employee's  right  to any  earned  or  unearned  portion  of
                    Incentive  Compensation  under  this  Agreement  payable  to
                    Employee shall terminate immediately.

               2.   In the event of Employee's  termination  of employment  with
                    the Company or its affiliated units due to Employee's death,
                    Permanent   Disability   or   Retirement,    any   Incentive
                    Compensation,  pro-rated for the length of employment during
                    the Performance Period and earned,  payable, and outstanding
                    under Section B of this Agreement, shall remain payable, but
                    only to the extent such Incentive  Compensation  was payable
                    on the date of such Employee's termination of employment. If
                    on the  date of such  termination  of  employment,  any such
                    Incentive  Compensation is not payable,  the Committee shall
                    have the  discretion  to cause such  compensation  to become
                    payable  on the date or dates  specified  therein as if such
                    termination  of employment  had not occurred.  The Committee
                    may exercise the  discretion  granted to it by the preceding
                    sentence  at the time this  Agreement  is executed or at any
                    time thereafter while such Agreement remains in force.

               3.   In the event of Employee's  termination  of employment  with
                    the  Company at the request of the  Company  without  cause,
                    Employee's  right  to  any  unearned  portion  of  Incentive
                    Compensation  under this Agreement payable to Employee shall
                    terminate immediately.

                    Any Incentive Compensation earned,  payable, and outstanding
                    under  Section B of this  Agreement  shall  remain  payable,
                    pro-rated   for  the   length  of   employment   during  the
                    Performance  Period,  but only to the extent such  Incentive
                    Compensation   was   payable  on  the  date  of   Employee's
                    termination.

               4.   Notwithstanding  any other provisions of this Agreement,  if
                    Employee's  employment or service is terminated by reason of
                    a breach of Employee's employment agreement with the Company
                    or  any  of  its  affiliated  units,  as  determined  by the
                    Committee, or by reason of Employee's commission of a felony
                    or  a  misdemeanor   against  the  Company  or  any  of  its
                    affiliated units (whether or not prosecuted), this Agreement
                    shall be deemed terminated and not payable to Employee.

          C.   Term of Agreement.  This Agreement shall remain in effect for the
               duration of the  Performance  Period,  unless  terminated  due to
               reasons discussed in Sections I.B or II.B herein.

          D.   Deferral  of  Compensation.  Incentive  Compensation  under  this
               Agreement  will be paid in  accordance  with this  Agreement  and
               shall be eligible  for deferral in  accordance  with the terms of
               the Associated Banc-Corp Deferred Compensation Plan.

          E.   Manner of Payment.  Incentive  Compensation  under this Agreement
               will be paid in  conjunction  with  Employee's  regular  paycheck
               first  following  the  payout  of  the  award,  as an  additional
               compensation item.

          F.   Withholding  of Taxes.  Pursuant to  applicable  federal,  state,
               local or foreign laws, the Company will withhold  income or other
               taxes upon the payment of any compensation under this Agreement.

          G.   No Employment or Retention  Agreement  Intended.  This  Agreement
               does not  confer  upon  Employee  any  right to  continuation  of
               employment or retention in service in any capacity by the Company
               or an  affiliated  unit and does not  constitute an employment or
               retention agreement of any kind.

          H.   Nonsolicitation:  For a period of one year following  termination
               of  Employee's  employment  with the Company,  Employee will not,

                    affiliates,  and with whom  Employee has had contact  during
                    the twelve month period prior to  termination  of Employee's
                    employment with the Company (the "Reference Period");

               (b)  request or advise any of the Active Customers,  suppliers or
                    other  business  contacts of the  Company who have  business
                    relationships  with the Company and with whom  Employee  had
                    contact  during  his/her  employment  with  the  Company  to
                    withdraw,  curtail or cancel any of their business relations
                    with the Company;

               (c)  induce or attempt to induce any employee or other  personnel
                    of the  Company  to  terminate  his or her  relationship  or

                         securities of the surviving or resulting corporation is
                         owned  in  the  aggregate  by the  shareholders  of the

                         such merger or  consolidation,  other than  affiliates,
                         within the meaning of the  Securities  and Exchange Act
                         of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act"), of any party

                         of which the Company is a member, or

                    (iv) A person,  within the  meaning of  sections  3(a)(9) or
                         13(d)(3) of the Exchange  Act,  acquires 25% or more of
                         the  outstanding   voting  securities  of  the  Company
                         (whether  directly,  indirectly,   beneficially  or  of
                         record).

                    For purposes  hereof,  ownership of voting  securities shall
                    take into account and shall include  ownership as determined
                    by applying the provisions of Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(I)  (relating
                    to options) as of the Exchange Act.

               6.   Active Customer. "Active Customer" shall mean any account or

                    behalf of the Company or was under "Active  Solicitation" by
                    the Company and with which  Employee had contact  during the
                    Reference Period.

               7.   Active  Solicitation.  "Active  Solicitation"  shall mean at
                    least two  contacts,  in person,  by letter or  facsimile or
                    telephone,  by  any  personnel  of  the  Company,  including
                    Employee, during the Reference Period.

               8.   Performance Period.  "Performance Period" shall mean January
                    1,  2001  through  December  31,  2003;  or  any  subsequent
                    three-year period beginning any January 1 thereafter.

          B.   Transfers/Change  in Position.  A change in employment or service
               from the Company to an  affiliated  unit of the Company,  or vice
               versa,  or to a  different  position  within  the  Company,  will
               constitute  termination  of this  Agreement.  The  Committee  may
               determine  that a new  Agreement be executed for the new position
               in accordance with approved  Participation  Guidelines.  Any such
               new Agreement  shall be deemed a  continuation  of the Employee's
               participation and of the three-year  Performance Period satisfied
               as of the date of the transfer or change in position.

               If  an  Employee's  new  position  does  not  meet  the  approved
               Participation  Guidelines and a new Agreement,  therefore, is not
               entered into, the Employee shall be eligible to receive a portion
               of any payment  due under this  Agreement  on a  pro-rated  basis
               according to the length of service the Employee  satisfied during
               the  Performance  Period.  Any  such  payment  due  will  be made
               according to the timing and payment terms and  conditions of this
               Agreement.

                                       3

          C.   Leaves.  The Committee (or board of directors in case of a member
               of the Committee)  may determine  that, for purposes of the Plan,
               an Employee who is on leave of absence  will still be  considered
               as in the continuous employment or service of the Company.

          D.   Notices.  Any notice to be given to the Committee under the terms
               of this Agreement  shall be addressed to the Company,  in care of

               may hereafter  designate in writing to the other. Any such notice
               shall be deemed to have been duly given if  personally  delivered

               as aforesaid, certified and deposited, postage prepaid, in a post

               benefit of any successor or successors of the Company.

          F.   Wisconsin  Contract.  This  Agreement  has  been  negotiated  and
               effected in Wisconsin  and shall be  construed  under the laws of
               that state.

          G.   Employment Contract. This Agreement is not an employment contract
               of any kind between  Associated or any of its  affiliates and the

               and its employees.  Associated may terminate  employment  without
               any notice at any time and for any reason not  prohibited by law.
               Any representation to the contrary is not binding upon Associated
               unless  signed  in  writing  by  Associated's  President  and the
               employee.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused these presents to be executed in
its behalf by its  chairman  and chief  executive  officer  and  attested by its

                                   Schedule A

                              Calculation of Awards

1.   Calculation of Awards

     Performance  Unit cash awards are determined based upon results against the
     targeted cumulative basic Earnings Per Share for the three-year performance
     period beginning January 1, 2001. The performance  target and the basis for
     calculating awards for the specified  performance period are defined below.
     Awards are  calculated  as a percentage of base salary that is in effect as
     of the inception of the plan. For new participants,  salary will be that as
     of the  first day of  participation  in the plan.

     A.   Company Performance Measure

          Performance  against the target  Earnings  Per Share  growth rate will
          based  upon the  cumulative  basic EPS for each of the three  years as
          approved by the Administrative  Committee of the Board. Annual results
          will be  reviewed  by the  Committee  at the same  time the  Committee
          reviews the results of the annual  Performance  Incentive Plan.  Under
          certain circumstances,  the Committee may adjust the fully diluted EPS
          results of the annual  Performance  Incentive  Plan for part or all of
          extraordinary  gains  or  losses  for the  year.  An  example  of such
          adjustments  would be  restructuring  charges  relative to mergers and
          acquisitions.  In  those  instances,  the  same  adjustments  would be
          applied to the basic EPS  results of the  long-term  Performance  Unit
          Plan for that year. As in the case of the annual performance plan, the
          CEO will make  recommendations  relative  to any  adjustments  for the
          Committee to consider.

                              EPS Growth Objectives
                              ---------------------

B.   Peer Group Modifier

     Awards for  company  performance  may be  increased  or reduced  based upon
     performance  relative to the peer  group.  The peer group is defined as the
     top 50 banks reported by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW) as of the end of the
     performance  period,  excluding  the top 10 largest banks in this group and
     excluding any  companies  with a mix of business  which is not  principally
     commercial banking (currently identified as State Street Corporation,  MBNA
     Corporation and Northern Trust Corp).

     The peer ranking will be measured on the basis of the reported  diluted EPS
     growth  during the  performance  period  between  January  1, 2001  through
     December 31, 2003.

                  Peer Group Modifier


-    Relative  peer group  performance  is used to modify the initial  incentive
     award (e.g., +/-25%)


-    Initial Incentive Award Percentile Multiple Relative Performance

         Growth

                               45th - 55th         1.00

                               25th - 45th         0.90

                               Less than 25th      0.75



           Maximum Award: 150% target (at 12% EPS growth) X 1.25 = 188%

                                       5

<PAGE>

           Target Award: 100% target (at 10% EPS growth ) X 1.00 = 100%
           Threshold Award: 50% target (at 8% EPS growth) X 0.75 = 38%

2.   New Participants

     The Chief  Executive  Officer may approve new  participants as eligible for
     Performance  Units.  Participants  who become  eligible during a three-year
     period  will have  awards  pro-rated  based upon the number of months  they
     participated during the current Performance Period.

3.   Payment of Awards

     Performance Unit cash awards shall be calculated and paid during the Second
     Quarter of the year following the end of the Performance Period,  following
     evaluation of peer  comparison  results and approval of the  Administrative
     Committee of the Board.  Applicable state,  local and federal taxes will be
     withheld from payments as required by law.

                              RETIREMENT AGREEMENT

     THIS RETIREMENT  AGREEMENT is entered into this 26th day of April, 2000, by
and between HARRY B. CONLON  ("Conlon")  and ASSOCIATED  BANC-CORP,  a Wisconsin
corporation ("Associated").

     WHEREAS,  Conlon  wishes to retire  from his  position  as Chief  Executive
Officer of Associated and from his employment by Associated; and

     WHEREAS, in connection with such retirement, Associated and Conlon mutually
agree that the position of Chief Executive Officer be transferred from Conlon to
a successor  effective  as of April 1, 2000,  and that  Conlon's  employment  by
Associated shall be terminated  effective as of June 30, 2000 (the  "Termination
Date"); and

     WHEREAS,  in order to achieve a more orderly and efficient  transition to a
new CEO with a new management team, Associated wishes to retain Conlon after the
Termination Date to render consulting and advisory  services to Associated,  and
Conlon  wishes to make himself  available to provide such  services,  all on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; and

     WHEREAS,   Associated   and  Conlon  wish  to  set  forth  certain   mutual
understandings   with  respect  to  the  details  of  Conlon's  retirement  from
Associated,   his  service  on  the  Board  of  Directors,  and  his  consulting
relationship with Associated.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  provisions of this  Agreement,
Conlon and Associated do mutually agree as follows:

     1.   Transfer of CEO Position, Termination of Employment.

     Effective  as of April 1,  2000,  Conlon  ceased to be  Associated's  Chief
Executive Officer and such position was transferred to a successor.  Thereafter,
Conlon shall remain an employee of Associated  through the Termination  Date, as
of which such date Conlon's employment relationship with Associated shall end.

     2.   Consulting Services.

     (a)  Conlon  shall  provide  limited   consulting  and  advisory   services
exclusively to Associated from the Termination  Date through  December 31, 2001.
During the term of this Agreement,  Conlon shall devote  substantial  efforts to
his

                                       8

<PAGE>

position as an independent  consultant  and advisor and shall perform  corporate
development  services  and such other  tasks as may be  reasonably  assigned  to
Conlon by the Board or  Associated's  Chief  Executive  Officer,  subject to the
mutual  agreement of the parties.  Conlon  agrees that  Associated is willing to
engage  Conlon on the basis that he will provide these  limited  consulting  and
advisory  services  exclusively to Associated  through December 31, 2001. Conlon
agrees  that he will not provide  such  consulting  or advisory  services to any
other  banking   organization  during  this  exclusive  consulting  period  with
Associated.

     (b) As  compensation  for the foregoing  consulting and advisory  services,
Conlon shall be entitled to the compensation described in Paragraph 3 below, and
shall be entitled to no other compensation.

     (c) In  addition,  Associated  shall  reimburse  Conlon for all  reasonable
expenses  incurred by Conlon in the  performance of his  obligations  under this
Paragraph 2; provided,  however, that sufficient documentation has been provided
to Associated.

     (d) In performing the services  specified in this Paragraph 2, Conlon shall
be  acting  as an  independent  contractor  and  shall  not  be an  employee  of
Associated.  Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall be construed to create a
partnership or joint venture  between  Associated  and Conlon,  nor to authorize
either  Associated  or Conlon to act as a general or special  agent of the other
party in any respect except as specifically set forth in this Agreement.

     3.   Payments and Benefits.

     (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Conlon shall receive his
regular salary and benefits through the Termination Date.

     (b) Conlon has served as Associated's  Chief Executive Officer for 25 years
and has  served as the  chairman  of the Board for 12 years.  During  that time,
Associated has grown from  approximately $300 million in assets to $12.3 billion
as of  September  30,  1999;  Associated  also  has had one of the  lowest  loan
charge-offs  percentages  in the industry.  During the period from 1989 to 1998,
Associated's  shareholders  received  a  total  return  of  approximately  600%.
Associated is now the third largest bank holding  company in Wisconsin and has a
significant presence in Illinois and the Twin Cities.

     Associated  recognizes the substantial growth of Associated during Conlon's
tenure.   Accordingly,   in  consideration  of  the  substantial  expertise  and
experience  that Conlon  would bring to a  competitor  if he were free to do so,
Conlon shall be entitled to additional compensation in the following amounts:

                                      9

<PAGE>

          - In  consideration  of the  covenant  not  to  compete  (pursuant  to
     Paragraph 6 below),  the benefits  described in Paragraphs 3(c) through (i)
     below and the sum of  $250,000  for the period  from the  Termination  Date
     through  December 31, 2000,  $350,000 for calendar year 2001,  and $200,000
     for calendar year 2002; and

          - Associated has  determined  that it is in its best interests to have
     an orderly and efficient transition to a new CEO with a new management team
     and that Conlon,  with his  substantial  expertise and  experience,  can be
     instrumental  in  helping  Associated  achieve  such a  smooth  transition.
     Accordingly,  in  consideration  of the  director and  consulting  services
     described  herein,  Conlon shall be entitled to additional  compensation in
     the following amounts:

          - In consideration of the consulting services (pursuant to Paragraph 2
     above), the sum of $50,000 for the period from the Termination Date through
     December 31, 2000, and $50,000 for calendar year 2001.

     (c) With respect to each of the employee benefit plans listed below, Conlon
shall be entitled to the following benefits.

          (i)  The  normal  contribution  for  the  Plan  Year  2000  under  the
     Associated  Banc-Corp  Profit  Sharing  and  Retirement  Savings  Plan (the
     "Profit Sharing Plan"),  effective January 1, 1989, as amended,  calculated
     on the basis of Conlon's annual compensation  through the Termination Date;
     provided,  that if Conlon constitutes an "Inactive  Participant" as defined
     in Article 1 of the Profit  Sharing  Plan, he shall receive this benefit in
     cash.

          (ii)  The  normal  contribution  for the  Plan  Year  2000  under  the
     Associated  Banc-Corp  Retirement  Account  Plan (the  "Retirement  Plan"),
     restated effective January 1, 1989, as amended,  calculated on the basis of
     Conlon's annual compensation through the Termination Date.

     (d) With  respect to  Associated's  annual  bonus  plan,  Associated  shall
calculate  the bonus to which  Conlon  would have been  entitled  if he had been
employed  by  Associated  through  December  31,  2000  at  his  normal  salary.
Associated shall pay to Conlon in cash one-half (1/2) of such amount at the time
the  bonus  is paid  to  other  similarly-situated  employees  whose  employment
continues through December 31, 2000.

     (e) In addition to the  foregoing,  Associated  shall pay the  premiums for
Conlon's  Northwestern  Mutual Life Insurance  Policy (Policy No.  10670456) for
calendar year 2000.

     (f) At all times during the term of this  Agreement  after the  Termination
Date, so long as other  similarly-situated  retirees  receive  health and dental
benefits,  Conlon shall be entitled to participate in  Associated's  medical and
dental

                                       10

insurance plan on the same basis as other  retirees.  If, at any time, such plan
is discontinued for any reason, Associated shall continue to provide Conlon with
comparable  benefits for his remaining  lifetime.  Conlon will pay all necessary
premiums for the benefits under this Paragraph 3(f).

     (g)  Associated  shall pay the  foregoing  amounts  and shall  provide  the
foregoing  benefits in accordance with Associated's  normal payroll and employee
benefits policies, except that each of the amounts payable under Paragraphs 3(c)
and 3(d), above, shall be paid to Conlon as soon as reasonably practicable after
such amounts have been determined. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however:

          (i) Associated shall pay to Conlon in a lump sum on the first business
     day of January 2001 the $400,000  payment owing hereunder for calendar year
     2001; and

          (ii)  Associated  shall  pay  to  Conlon  in a lump  sum on the  first
     business day of January  2002 the  $200,000  payment  owing  hereunder  for
     calendar year 2002.

All amounts paid to Conlon hereunder shall be made by check or wire transfer to
Conlon's account or accounts, which he shall designate in writing to Associated.

     (h) In  recognition  of the  services  that  Conlon has  provided  and will
continue to provide to Associated,  if Conlon dies prior to receiving any or all
of the amounts listed under this Paragraph 3,  Associated  shall pay to Conlon's
estate  any  amounts  that are or  become  payable  to Conlon  pursuant  to this
Paragraph 3, at the time such amounts would otherwise have been paid to Conlon.

     (i) Nothing in this Agreement  shall forfeit or otherwise  affect  Conlon's
right to vested  benefits in the Profit  Sharing Plan and the  Retirement  Plan,
which such  benefits  shall be paid to Conlon (or his legal  representatives  or
heirs) according to such plans or policies.

     4. Director Compensation.  For the period from the Termination Date through
December 31, 2002,  Conlon shall receive no additional  compensation for serving
as  chairman  or member of the Board other than the  compensation  described  in
Paragraph 3 above.  For any period  after  December 31, 2002 during which Conlon
serves as chairman or a member of the Board,  Associated shall pay to Conlon the
director fees normally  received by one of Associated's  directors  serving in a
similar capacity. At all times after the date of this Agreement, Conlon shall be
entitled  to expense  reimbursement  to the same  extent as  Associated's  other
directors serving in a similar capacity.

     5.   Stock Options.

                                       11

<PAGE>

     (a)  Effective  as of  the  date  of  this  Agreement,  the  Administrative
Committee of Associated's Board of Directors has agreed and hereby  acknowledges
that (i) to the extent not already  vested,  all stock options  issued under the
Associated  Banc-Corp Restated Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan and the Associated
Banc-Corp  1999  Nonqualified  Stock  Option  Plan shall  continue to vest as if
Conlon's  retirement  had not occurred  and (ii) all such  options  shall remain
exercisable  after the  Termination  Date as if Conlon had not  retired.  If not
exercised  timely,  incentive  stock options will become  nonqualified  options,
pursuant to federal tax law.

     (b) Effective as of the date Conlon  exercises his final options granted in
1993, the Administrative  Committee of Associated's Board of Directors agrees to
grant to Conlon during 2000, under the Associated  Banc-Corp Long-Term Incentive
Stock Plan,  additional  nonqualified stock options to purchase 31,250 shares of
Associated  stock.  These options will vest one year after their grant date, and
shall remain  exercisable for a three-year term. The strike price will equal the
stock price on the date Conlon  exercises the last of the stock options  granted
to him in 1993.

     6.   Covenant Not to Compete.

     (a) Associated shall be irreparably  harmed and may suffer severe financial
loss  if  Conlon  is  employed  by  or  provides  services  to a  competitor  of
Associated. Conlon, by signing this Agreement,  acknowledges that he understands
that the  restrictive  covenant  described  in this  Paragraph  6 will limit his
future business and employment  activities;  that, in light of the consideration
to be received by him under this Agreement,  such limitations are reasonable and
are not now, nor does he expect them to be in the future,  unreasonably harsh or
onerous; that such limitations are reasonably necessary to protect the interests
of Associated; and that the prohibited territory described below encompasses the
primary  territory  in which his  activities  would  have an  adverse  effect on
Associated.

     (b) At all times prior to the  earlier of (i) January 1, 2003,  or (ii) one
year after Conlon leaves the Associated Board of Directors, Conlon shall not, in
the  following  counties,  engage  in  competitive  activities  on  behalf  of a
competitive business,  without first obtaining written permission from the Board
or Associated's Chief Executive Officer:

          (i) The  Wisconsin  counties of  Ashland,  Bayfield,  Brown,  Buffalo,
     Clark, Columbia,  Dane, Dodge, Door, Eau Claire, Fond du Lac, Forest, Iron,

     Winnebago and Woodford; and

         (iii) The Minnesota counties of Hennepin, Rice and St. Louis.

     "Engage in  competitive  activities"  shall mean  rendering  services  as a
director, a chief executive officer (or in a similar executive capacity) or as a
consultant (other than to businesses owned by immediate family members) with any
commercial  banking  organization,  where such services  would be similar to the
services provided by Conlon during his employment by Associated.  A "competitive
business" shall mean any person or entity engaged in banking,  which such person
or entity competes with the services or products provided by Associated.

     (c) If Conlon violates any of his material obligations under this Paragraph
6,  Associated  shall be entitled to injunctive  relief in addition to any other
monetary remedies available to it.

     7. Taxes. All payments and benefits provided for under this Agreement shall
be subject to all applicable legal  requirements with respect to the withholding

provided in the By-Laws of Associated and as provided by the Wisconsin  Business
Corporation Law. Conlon shall cooperate as reasonably  requested by Associated's
counsel in the defense of any legal  actions  brought  against  Associated  with
respect to matters occurring during Conlon's employment with Associated.

this Agreement shall be published, displayed, discussed, disclosed, revealed, or

any way to anyone  under any  circumstances,  other than those  required by law;
provided, however, that it is understood that Associated may communicate various
provisions  of  this  Agreement  within  its  organization  as  needed  for  the
implementation  of the Agreement and to its  attorneys,  financial  advisors and
accountants,  and that Conlon may divulge the contents of this  Agreement to his
spouse, attorneys, financial advisors, and income tax preparers. Notwithstanding
the  foregoing,  Associated  shall be entitled to disclose  the contents and the

filing  or  disclosure  document  required  to be made or  filed  by  Associated
pursuant to all applicable  securities  and banking laws and  regulations or the
disclosure obligations of any exchange or trading market.

deemed to have been given when personally delivered or two days after deposit in
the United States mail.

     11.  Waiver.  The waiver of either party of a breach of a provision of this

subsequent breach by such other party.

     12.  Severability.  The  provisions  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  deemed
severable and the  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of any provision  shall not

similar  transaction  if, as a condition  of such sale,  merger,  consolidation,
reorganization, or other similar transaction, Associated requires such Affiliate
to expressly assume the duties and obligations  hereunder and to expressly agree
to perform this Agreement to the same extent as Associated  would be required if
no assignment had taken place.  An  "Affiliate"  shall mean any entity (a) which
owns a  controlling  interest  in  Associated,  (b) in which  Associated  owns a
controlling  interest,  or (c) which is under common  control  with  Associated.
Otherwise,  this Agreement may not be assigned by Associated without the express
written consent of Conlon (or his legal representatives).
