Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Statements  made in this  document and in  documents  that are  incorporated  by
reference which are not purely  historical are  forward-looking  statements,  as
defined in the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995,  including any
statements regarding  descriptions of management's plans,  objectives,  or goals
for future  operations,  products or services,  and  forecasts of its  revenues,
earnings, or other measures of performance. Forward-looking statements are based
on current  management  expectations and, by their nature,  are subject to risks
and  uncertainties.  These statements may be identified by the use of words such
as "believe,"  "expect,"  "anticipate,"  "plan,"  "estimate,"  "should," "will,"
"intend," or similar expressions.

Shareholders  should  note  that  many  factors,  some of  which  are  discussed
elsewhere  in this  document  and in the  documents  that  are  incorporated  by
reference, could affect the future financial results of Associated Banc-Corp and
could  cause  those  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  in
forward-looking  statements  contained  or  incorporated  by  reference  in this
document.  These  factors,  many of  which  are  beyond  Associated  Banc-Corp's
control, include the following:

o    operating, legal, and regulatory risks;

o    economic,   political,   and  competitive   forces   affecting   Associated
     Banc-Corp's  banking,  securities,  asset  management,  and credit services
     businesses; and

o    the risk that  Associated  Banc-Corp's  analyses  of these risks and forces
     could be  incorrect  and/or that the  strategies  developed to address them
     could be unsuccessful.

These factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements,
and undue  reliance  should  not be placed on such  statements.  Forward-looking
statements  speak  only as of the  date  they  are  made.  Associated  Banc-Corp
undertakes  no obligation  to update or revise any  forward-looking  statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

                                     PART I

ITEM 1  BUSINESS

General

Associated Banc-Corp  (individually  referred to herein as the "Parent Company,"
and together with all of its subsidiaries and affiliates,  collectively referred
to herein as the "Corporation") is a bank holding company registered pursuant to
the  Bank  Holding  Company  Act  of  1956,  as  amended  (the  "Act").  It  was
incorporated  in Wisconsin in 1964 and was inactive  until 1969 when  permission
was  received  from the Board of  Governors  of the  Federal  Reserve  System to
acquire  three  banks.  At December  31, 2003,  the Parent  Company  owned three
commercial  banks located in Illinois,  Minnesota,  and Wisconsin  serving their
respective local  communities and, measured by total assets held at December 31,
2003, was the second largest  commercial bank holding company  headquartered  in
Wisconsin.  The  Parent  Company  also  owned 22  limited  purpose  banking  and
nonbanking  subsidiaries located in Arizona,  California,  Illinois,  Minnesota,
Nevada, and Wisconsin.

Services

The Parent Company provides advice and specialized  services to its subsidiaries
in   policy   and   operations,    including    auditing,    data    processing,
marketing/advertising,  investing,  legal/compliance,  personnel services, trust
services,  risk  management,   facilities  management,   security,   purchasing,
treasury, finance, accounting, and other financial services functionally related
to banking.

Responsibility  for  the  management  of the  subsidiaries  remains  with  their
respective   boards  of  directors  and  officers.   Services  rendered  to  the
subsidiaries  by the Parent Company are intended to assist the local  management
of these  subsidiaries  to expand  the scope of  services  offered  by them.  At
December 31, 2003,  bank  subsidiaries of the Parent Company  provided  services
through 217 locations in 151 communities.


                                       3
<PAGE>

Through  its  banking  subsidiaries  and various  nonbanking  subsidiaries,  the
Corporation  provides a diversified range of banking and nonbanking  services to
individuals and businesses.  These services include checking, savings, and money
market deposit  accounts,  business,  personal,  educational,  residential,  and
commercial mortgage loans, other consumer-oriented financial services, including
IRA and Keogh accounts,  lease financing for a variety of capital  equipment for
commerce  and  industry,  and safe  deposit  and  night  depository  facilities.
Automated  Teller Machines  (ATMs),  which provide  24-hour banking  services to
customers,  are installed in many locations in the Corporation's  service areas.
The  Corporation  participates  in an interstate  and  international  shared ATM
network,  which allows its customers to perform banking  transactions from their
checking,  savings,  or  credit  card  accounts  at  ATMs in a  multi-state  and
international environment.  Among the services designed specifically to meet the
needs of businesses are various types of specialized financing,  cash management
services, and transfer/collection facilities.

The Corporation provides lending,  depository, and related financial services to
individual,  commercial, industrial, financial, and governmental customers. Term
loans, revolving credit arrangements,  letters of credit, inventory and accounts
receivable  financing,  real  estate  construction  lending,  and  international
banking services are available.

The Corporation is involved in the  origination,  servicing,  and warehousing of
mortgage loans and the sale of such loans to investors.  The primary focus is on
one- to four-family residential and multi-family properties, which are generally
salable into the secondary mortgage market. The principal mortgage lending areas
are Wisconsin,  Minnesota, and Illinois.  Nearly all long-term,  fixed-rate real
estate  mortgage loans  generated are sold in the secondary  market and to other
financial institutions, with the servicing of those loans retained.

In addition to real estate loans,  the  Corporation  originates  and/or services
consumer loans,  business credit card loans, and student loans.  Consumer,  home
equity, and student lending  activities are principally  conducted in Wisconsin,
Minnesota,  and  Illinois,  while the credit card base and  resulting  loans are
principally centered in the Midwest.

Lending  involves credit risk.  Credit risk is controlled and monitored  through
active  asset  quality  management  and the use of lending  standards,  thorough
review of potential borrowers,  and active asset quality administration.  Active
asset quality  administration,  including early problem loan  identification and
timely resolution of problems,  further ensures appropriate management of credit
risk and minimization of loan losses.  The allowance for loan losses  represents
management's  estimate  of an amount  adequate to provide  for  probable  losses
inherent in the loan portfolio.  Management's  evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses is based on management's ongoing review and grading of
the loan portfolio,  consideration of past loan loss experience,  trends in past
due and nonperforming loans, risk characteristics of the various classifications
of loans, current economic conditions,  the fair value of underlying collateral,
and other  qualitative  and  quantitative  factors which could affect  potential
credit losses.  Credit risk  management is discussed  under  sections  "Critical
Accounting  Policies,"  "Loans," "Allowance for Loan Losses," and "Nonperforming
Loans,  Potential  Problem Loans,  and Other Real Estate Owned" in "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations,"  and
under Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," and Note 4, "Loans,"
in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Additional  emphasis is given to noncredit  services for  commercial  customers,
such as advice and  assistance in the placement of  securities,  corporate  cash
management,  and financial planning.  The bank subsidiaries make available check
clearing, safekeeping, loan participations, lines of credit, portfolio analyses,
and other services to approximately 120 correspondent financial institutions.

The  Corporation  offers a wide  variety of  fiduciary,  investment  management,
advisory, and corporate agency services to individuals, corporations, charitable
trusts,  foundations,  and  institutional  investors.  It also  administers  (as
trustee and in other fiduciary and representative  capacities)  pension,  profit
sharing, and other employee benefit plans, and personal trusts and estates.

Discount and  full-service  brokerage  services  are offered by the  Corporation
through registered broker-dealers.  These services include the sale of fixed and
variable annuities,  mutual funds, and securities.

                                       4
<PAGE>

Certain of the Corporation's subsidiaries headquartered in Arizona and Wisconsin
provide  commercial and individual  insurance services and engage in reinsurance
activities.  Various life,  property,  casualty,  credit, and mortgage insurance
products  are also  offered.  Employment  advisory and  counseling  services are
provided  to  the  Parent  Company's   subsidiaries  and  customers  through  an
employment advisory  subsidiary.  Two investment  subsidiaries located in Nevada
hold, manage,  and trade cash,  stocks,  and securities and reinvest  investment
income.   Three  additional   investment   subsidiaries  formed  in  Nevada  and
headquartered and domiciled in the Cayman Islands,  provide investment  services
for  Associated  Bank,  National  Association  and  Associated  Bank  Minnesota,
National  Association.  The  investment  subsidiaries  also  provide  management
services  to  the   Corporation's   Real  Estate   Investment   Trust   ("REIT")
subsidiaries.  The  Corporation  does not engage in any material  operations  in
foreign countries.

The  Corporation is not dependent upon a single or a few customers,  the loss of
which  would have a material  adverse  effect on the  Corporation.  No  material
portion of the business of the Corporation is seasonal.

Employees

At December 31, 2003, the Corporation had 4,091 full-time equivalent  employees.

Competition

The financial services industry is highly competitive.  The Corporation competes
for loans, deposits, and financial services in all of its principal markets. The
Corporation  competes directly with other bank and nonbank  institutions located
within its markets,  with  out-of-market  banks and bank holding  companies that
advertise or otherwise serve the Corporation's  markets,  money market and other
mutual  funds,  brokerage  houses,  and various  other  financial  institutions.
Additionally,   the  Corporation  competes  with  insurance  companies,  leasing
companies, regulated small loan companies, credit unions, governmental agencies,
and  commercial  entities  offering  financial  services  products.  Competition
involves efforts to obtain new deposits, the scope and type of services offered,
interest  rates paid on deposits and charged on loans,  as well as other aspects
of banking.  The Corporation also faces direct  competition from members of bank
holding company systems that have greater assets and resources than those of the
Corporation.

Supervision and Regulation

Financial institutions are highly regulated both at the federal and state level.
Numerous statutes and regulations affect the business of the Corporation.

As a registered  bank holding  company under the Act, the Parent Company and its
nonbanking  subsidiaries  are regulated and supervised by the Board of Governors
of the Federal  Reserve  System  (the  "FRB").  The  nationally  chartered  bank
subsidiaries are supervised and examined by the Comptroller of the Currency. The
sole  state  chartered  bank  subsidiary  is  supervised  and  examined  by  the
applicable  Illinois state banking agency and by the Federal  Deposit  Insurance
Corporation  (the "FDIC").  All  subsidiaries  of the Parent Company that accept
insured deposits are subject to examination by the FDIC.

The  Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act of 1999  made  major  amendments  to the  Act.  The
amendments,  among other things, allow certain qualifying bank holding companies
to engage in activities that are financial in nature and that explicitly include
the underwriting and sale of insurance. The Act's provisions governing the scope
and manner of the FRB's  supervision  of bank holding  companies,  the manner in
which activities may be found to be financial in nature, and the extent to which
state laws on  insurance  will apply to insurance  activities  of banks and bank
subsidiaries  were also  amended.  The FRB has issued  regulations  implementing
these provisions. The Act, as amended, allows for the expansion of activities by
banking  organizations and permits  consolidation among financial  organizations
generally.  The  Parent  Company  is  required  to act as a source of  financial
strength  to each of its  subsidiaries

                                       5
<PAGE>

pursuant to which it may be required to commit  financial  resources  to support
such subsidiaries in circumstances when, absent such requirements,  it might not
do so. The Act also requires the prior  approval of the FRB to enable the Parent
Company to acquire  direct or indirect  control of more than five percent of any
class of voting  shares of any bank or bank  holding  company.  The Act  further
regulates the Corporation's  activities,  including requirements and limitations
relating to capital,  transactions  with  officers,  directors  and  affiliates,
securities issuances, dividend payments, inter-affiliate liabilities, extensions
of credit, and expansion through mergers and acquisitions.

The  federal  regulatory   authorities  have  broad  authority  to  enforce  the
regulatory requirements imposed on the Corporation. In particular, the Financial
Institutions  Reform,  Recovery and  Enforcement  Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") and the
Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation  Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"),  and
their implementing regulations,  carry greater enforcement powers. Under FIRREA,
all commonly controlled FDIC insured depository  institutions may be held liable
for any loss incurred by the FDIC resulting from a failure of, or any assistance
given by the FDIC to, any commonly controlled institutions.  Pursuant to certain
provisions under FDICIA,  the federal  regulatory  agencies have broad powers to
take prompt  corrective  action if a  depository  institution  fails to maintain
certain  capital  levels.   Prompt  corrective   action  may  include,   without
limitation,  restricting  the  ability  of the  Corporation  to  pay  dividends,
restricting  acquisitions or other activities,  and placing limitations on asset
growth.

Pursuant to the Riegle-Neal  Interstate Banking and Branching  Efficiency Act of
1994  ("Riegle-Neal  Act"),  an adequately  capitalized and managed bank holding
company may acquire banks in states other than its home state without  regard to
the  permissibility of such acquisitions  under state law, but remain subject to
state  requirements that a bank has been organized and operating for a period of
time. Subject to certain other restrictions, the Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes
banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches. The Riegle-Neal
Amendments Act of 1997 provides  guidance on the  application of host state laws
to any branch located outside the host state.

The FDIC maintains the Bank  Insurance Fund ("BIF") and the Savings  Association
Insurance  Fund  ("SAIF") by  assessing  depository  institutions  an  insurance
premium twice a year.  The amount each  institution is assessed is based both on
the balance of insured deposits held during the preceding two quarters,  as well
as on the  degree of risk the  institution  poses to the  insurance  fund.  FDIC
assesses  higher  rates on those  institutions  that pose  greater  risks to the
insurance  funds.  Effective  April 1, 2000, the FDIC Board of Directors  ("FDIC
Board") adopted revisions to the FDIC's  regulation  governing deposit insurance
assessments which  it  believes   enhance  the  present   system  by  allowing
institutions  with improving  capital  positions to benefit from the improvement
more  quickly  while  requiring  those  with  failing  capital  to pay a  higher
assessment  sooner.  The Federal Deposit  Insurance Act governs the authority of
the FDIC Board to set BIF and SAIF  assessment  rates and directs the FDIC Board
to establish a risk-based assessment system for insured depository  institutions
and set  assessments  to the extent  necessary to maintain the reserve  ratio at
1.25%.

In 2001,  Congress  enacted the Uniting and  Strengthening  America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act)
Act of 2001 (the "Patriot Act").  The Patriot Act is designed to deny terrorists
and  criminals  the  ability to obtain  access to the United  States'  financial
system and has significant  implications for depository  institutions,  brokers,
dealers, and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act
mandates  financial  services  companies  to implement  additional  policies and
procedures with respect to additional measures designed to address any or all of
the following matters:  money laundering,  terrorist financing,  identifying and
reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions, and currency crimes.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley") addresses, among other things,
corporate  governance,  auditing and  accounting,  executive  compensation,  and
enhanced  and timely  disclosure  of corporate  information.  The New York Stock
Exchange and NASDAQ submitted  corporate  governance rules to the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")  which were  approved on  November 4, 2003.  These
changes  are  intended  to allow  stockholders  to monitor  the  performance  of
companies and directors more easily and efficiently.  Effective August 29, 2002,
as  prescribed  by

                                       6
<PAGE>

Sections  302(a)  and 906  (effective  July  29,  2002) of  Sarbanes-Oxley,  the
Corporation's  chief  executive  officer  ("CEO")  and chief  financial  officer
("CFO") each are required to certify that the Corporation's quarterly and annual
reports do not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact.  Section 404 of
Sarbanes-Oxley,  which does not become  effective until 2004,  requires that the
CEO and CFO certify that they (i) are responsible for establishing, maintaining,
and  regularly  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  the  Corporation's  internal
controls;  (ii) have made certain disclosures to the Corporation's  auditors and
the  audit  committee  of  the  Corporation's  board  of  directors  ("Board  of
Directors") about the Corporation's  internal controls;  and (iii) have included
information  in the  Corporation's  quarterly  and annual  reports  about  their
evaluation and whether there have been significant  changes in the Corporation's
internal controls or in other factors that could  significantly  affect internal
controls  subsequent to such evaluation.  The requirements under  Sarbanes-Oxley
will  not  result  in  any  significant  changes  to the  Corporation's  current
processes  and  procedures,  and the  Corporation  is prepared to implement  any
changes necessary within the specified  timeframe.  At its January 22, 2003, and
April 23, 2003, meetings, the Board of Directors approved a series of actions to
strengthen its corporate governance practices,  including the adoption of a Code
of Ethics for Directors and Executive Officers, the establishment of a toll-free
ethics  hotline  (i.e.,  "whistle  blower"),  and the revision of the  following
charters:  Audit  Committee,  Administrative  Committee,  Nominating  and Search
Committee, and Corporate Development Committee. Additional information regarding
the Corporation's corporate governance practices is available on its web site at
www.associatedbank.com.

The laws and  regulations  to which the  Corporation  is subject are  constantly
under  review  by  Congress,  the  federal  regulatory  agencies,  and the state
authorities.  These laws and  regulations  could be changed  drastically  in the
future, which could affect the profitability of the Corporation,  its ability to
compete  effectively,  or the composition of the financial  services industry in
which the Corporation competes.

Government Monetary Policies and Economic Controls

The earnings and growth of the banking industry and the Corporation are affected
by the credit  policies of monetary  authorities,  including the Federal Reserve
System ("Federal  Reserve").  An important function of the Federal Reserve is to
regulate the  national  supply of bank credit in order to combat  recession  and
curb  inflationary  pressures.  Among the instruments of monetary policy used by
the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market  operations in
U.S. government securities,  changes in reserve requirements against member bank
deposits, and changes in the Federal Reserve discount rate. These means are used
in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans,  investments,
and deposits,  and may also affect  interest  rates charged on loans or paid for
deposits.  The monetary  policies of the Federal Reserve  authorities have had a
significant  effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and
are expected to continue to have such an effect in the future.

In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets,
as well as the effect of credit  policies  by monetary  and fiscal  authorities,
including the Federal  Reserve,  no prediction can be made as to possible future
changes in interest rates,  deposit levels,  and loan demand, or their effect on
the business and earnings of the Corporation.

ITEM 2  PROPERTIES

The  Corporation's  headquarters  are  located in the  Village  of  Ashwaubenon,
Wisconsin,  in a leased facility with approximately 30,000 square feet of office
space. The space is subject to a five-year lease with two consecutive  five-year
extensions.

At  December  31,  2003,  the bank  subsidiaries  occupied  217  offices  in 151
different communities within Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The main office
of Associated  Bank,  National  Association,  is owned. The bank subsidiary main
offices in  downtown  Chicago  and  Minneapolis  are  located in the  lobbies of
multistory   office   buildings.   Most  bank  subsidiary   branch  offices  are
freestanding  buildings  that  provide  adequate  customer  parking,   including
drive-through  facilities of various numbers and types for customer convenience.
Some bank subsidiaries  also have branch offices in supermarket  locations or in
retirement  communities.  In addition,  the Corporation owns other real property
that,  when  considered  in the  aggregate,  is not  material  to its  financial
position.

ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation may be named as defendant in
or be a party to various pending and threatened  legal  proceedings.  In view of
the  intrinsic  difficulty  in  ascertaining  the outcome of such  matters,  the
Corporation  cannot state what the eventual  outcome of any such proceeding will
be. Management  believes,  based upon discussions with legal counsel and current
knowledge,  that  liabilities  arising out of any such proceedings (if any) will
not have a  material  adverse  effect on the  consolidated  financial  position,
results of operations or liquidity of the Corporation.

ITEM 4  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no matters  submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.

ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion is management's analysis to assist in the understanding
and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations
of the  Corporation.  It should  be read in  conjunction  with the  consolidated
financial  statements  and footnotes and the selected  financial  data presented
elsewhere in this report.

During 2003, the  Corporation  merged  Associated  Card Services Bank,  National
Association, and Associated Bank Illinois, National Association, into Associated
Bank,  National  Association,  to  create  a  single  national  banking  charter
headquartered in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Also during 2003, the Corporation merged
Wisconsin Finance  Corporation,  Citizens Financial  Services,  Inc., and Signal
Finance Company into a single finance company under the name Riverside  Finance,
Inc.  During the second  quarter of 2002, the  Corporation  merged the Minnesota
bank subsidiaries (Associated Bank Minnesota,  Signal Bank National Association,
and Signal  Bank South  National  Association)  into a single  national  banking
charter under the name Associated Bank Minnesota, National Association.

The  financial   discussion  that  follows  may  refer  to  the  effect  of  the
Corporation's business combination activity,  detailed under section,  "Business
Combinations," and Note 2, "Business Combinations," of the notes to consolidated
financial statements.  The detailed financial discussion focuses on 2003 results
compared to 2002.  Discussion of 2002 results  compared to 2001 is predominantly
in section "2002 Compared to 2001."

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated  financial  statements,  management is required to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities  as of the date of the balance  sheet and  revenues and expenses for
the period.  Actual  results could differ  significantly  from those  estimates.
Estimates that are  particularly  susceptible to significant  change include the
determination  of the  allowance  for loan  losses,  mortgage  servicing  rights
valuation,  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities,  and income
taxes.

The  consolidated  financial  statements  of the  Corporation  are  prepared  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates.
This  preparation  requires  management  to  make  estimates,  assumptions,  and
judgments  that affect the  amounts  reported in the  financial  statements  and
accompanying  notes.  These estimates,  assumptions,  and judgments are based on
information available as of the date of the financial  statements;  accordingly,
as this  information  changes,  actual  results could differ from the estimates,
assumptions,  and  judgments  reflected  in the  financial  statements.  Certain
policies   inherently  have  a  greater   reliance  on  the  use  of  estimates,
assumptions, and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing
results that could be materially different than originally reported.  Management
believes  the  following  policies are both  important  to the  portrayal of the
Corporation's  financial condition and results and require subjective or complex
judgments  and,  therefore,  management  considers  the following to be critical
accounting  policies.  The critical  accounting  policies are discussed directly
with the Audit Committee of the Corporation.

Allowance for Loan Losses:

Management's  evaluation process used to determine the adequacy of the allowance
for loan losses is subject to the use of estimates,  assumptions, and judgments.
The evaluation process combines several factors: management's ongoing review and
grading  of the loan  portfolio,  consideration  of past loan  loss  experience,
trends in past due and nonperforming  loans, risk characteristics of the various
classifications  of  loans,  existing  economic  conditions,  the fair  value of
underlying  collateral,  and other  qualitative and  quantitative  factors which
could affect probable credit losses.  Because  current  economic  conditions can
change and future events are inherently  difficult to predict,  the  anticipated
amount of estimated  loan losses,  and therefore the adequacy of the  allowance,
could change  significantly.  As an integral part of their examination  process,
various  regulatory  agencies also review the  allowance  for loan losses.  Such
agencies may require that certain loan balances be

                                       13
<PAGE>

charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based
on their  judgments  about  information  available  to them at the time of their
examination.  The Corporation believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate
and properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements.  See Note 1,
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," and Note 4, "Loans," of the notes
to consolidated financial statements and section "Allowance for Loan Losses."

Mortgage  Servicing  Rights  Valuation:

The fair value of the Corporation's mortgage servicing rights asset is important
to the presentation of the consolidated  financial statements since the mortgage
servicing rights are carried on the  consolidated  balance sheet at the lower of
amortized  cost or fair  value.  Mortgage  servicing  rights  do not trade in an
active  open  market  with  readily  observable  prices.  As  such,  like  other
participants in the mortgage  banking  business,  the  Corporation  relies on an
internal  discounted  cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its mortgage
servicing  rights  and  consults  periodically  with  third  parties  as to  the
assumptions  used and that the resultant  valuation is within the context of the
market.  While the Corporation believes that the values produced by its internal
model  are  indicative  of the  fair  value  of its  mortgage  servicing  rights
portfolio, these values can change significantly depending upon the then current
interest  rate  environment,  estimated  prepayment  speeds  of  the  underlying
mortgages serviced,  and other economic  conditions.  The proceeds that might be
received  should  the  Corporation  actually  consider  a sale  of the  mortgage
servicing  rights  portfolio could differ from the amounts reported at any point
in time.  The  Corporation  believes  the  mortgage  servicing  rights  asset is
properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 1, "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies," and Note 5, "Goodwill and Other  Intangible
Assets,"  of  the  notes  to  consolidated   financial  statements  and  section
"Noninterest Expense."

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting:

In various aspects of its business,  the Corporation  uses derivative  financial
instruments  to modify  exposures to changes in interest rates and market prices
for other financial instruments. Substantially all of these derivative financial
instruments  are  designated as hedges for  financial  reporting  purposes.  The
application of the hedge accounting  policy requires  judgment in the assessment
of hedge  effectiveness,  identification  of similar hedged item groupings,  and
measurement  of changes in the fair value of hedged  items.  However,  if in the
future the derivative  financial  instruments  used by the Corporation no longer
qualify for hedge accounting treatment and, consequently, the change in the fair
value of  hedged  items  could be  recognized  in  earnings,  the  impact on the
consolidated  results of operations and reported  earnings could be significant.
The  Corporation  believes  hedge  effectiveness  is  evaluated  properly in the
consolidated   financial  statements.   See  Note  1,  "Summary  of  Significant
Accounting  Policies," and Note 15, "Derivative and Hedging  Activities," of the
notes to consolidated financial statements.

Income Tax Accounting:

The  assessment  of tax assets and  liabilities  involves the use of  estimates,
assumptions,   interpretations,  and  judgments  concerning  certain  accounting
pronouncements  and federal and state tax codes.  There can be no assurance that
future events,  such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing
authorities, will not differ from management's current assessment, the impact of
which  could be  significant  to the  consolidated  results  of  operations  and
reported earnings.  The Corporation  believes the tax assets and liabilities are
adequate and properly  recorded in the consolidated  financial  statements.  See
Note 1,  "Summary of  Significant  Accounting  Policies,"  and Note 13,  "Income
Taxes," of the notes to  consolidated  financial  statements and section "Income
Taxes."

Segment Review

As  described  in Note 20,  "Segment  Reporting,"  of the notes to  consolidated
financial  statements,  the Corporation's primary reportable segment is banking,
conducted  through  its bank and  lending  subsidiaries.  Banking  includes:  a)
community  banking - lending  and deposit  gathering  to  businesses  (including
business-related  services such as cash  management  and  international  banking
services) and to consumers  (including mortgages and credit cards); b) corporate
banking - specialized lending (such as commercial real estate), lease financing,
and banking to larger businesses and metro or niche markets;  and c) the support
to deliver banking services.

                                       14
<PAGE>

The Corporation's  profitability is primarily  dependent on net interest income,
noninterest  income,  the level of the  provision  for loan losses,  noninterest
expense,  and taxes of its  banking  segment.  The  consolidated  discussion  is
therefore  predominantly  describing the banking segment  results.  The critical
accounting policies primarily affect the banking segment,  with the exception of
income tax  accounting,  which affects both the banking and other  segments (see
section "Critical Accounting Policies").

Overview

The  Corporation is a multi-bank  holding  company  headquartered  in Wisconsin,
providing a diversified range of banking and nonbanking  services to individuals
and businesses primarily in its three-state footprint  (Wisconsin,  Illinois and
Minnesota).

The   Corporation's   primary   sources  of  revenue  are  net  interest  income
(predominantly  from loans and deposits,  though also from investments and other
funding sources),  and noninterest  income,  particularly fees and other revenue
from  financial  services  provided to customers.  Business  volumes and pricing
drive revenue potential,  and tend to be influenced by overall economic factors,
including  market  interest  rates,  business  spending,   consumer  confidence,
economic growth, and competitive conditions within the marketplace as well.

Noninterest  income growth in 2003 was led by mortgage  banking  income.  During
2003, interest rates reached record lows,  resulting in an unprecedented  volume
of mortgage loan  originations  and refinances.  As a result,  mortgage  banking
income  was up  25%  over  2002.  A  rapid  rise  in  mortgage  interest  rates,
particularly  during late third quarter,  slowed mortgage loan volume.  Industry
expectations are for mortgage  originations to fall dramatically in 2004, and as
such the Corporation expects lower mortgage banking income for 2004. Noninterest
income  sources  continue  to  be  diversified,   including  the   Corporation's
acquisition of an insurance agency in 2003.

The  Corporation's  loan mix changed during 2003, though total loans were $10.3
billion at year-end 2003, unchanged from year-end 2002. Competitive pricing on
new and refinanced loans in the low rate environment put downward pressure on
loan yields and the net interest margin in 2003.  Residential mortgage loans
decreased 11.7%, strongly influenced by high refinance activity. Home equity
(an area of emphasis for 2003 and an attractive product to consumers given the
low rate environment) and other consumer loans combined grew 5.4%, and
commercial loans grew 3.0%. Increases in business spending and consumer
confidence in 2004, along with an increase in interest rates, could create an
environment for increased earnings from loans for 2004.

Growth in deposits  continued to be strong throughout 2003. This growth reflects
a number of strategic  initiatives to grow the deposit base, as well as customer
preference  to keep  funds  more  liquid in this  prolonged  low  interest  rate
environment. Deposit growth initiatives will continue in 2004.

Asset quality administration was active during 2003 with early identification of
potential  problems and progress on several larger problem credits.  At year-end
2003 nonperforming loans were higher than historic levels, but a 1.73% allowance
for loan  losses to loans  ratio was  deemed  adequate  by  management.  Certain
economic  indicators  suggest that  business  spending has begun to increase and
that business and consumer financial positions are improving in line with recent
economic improvements.  While uncertainty exists as to how robust or sustainable
this trend may be, the impact of such  improvements  would likely be positive to
the Corporation's  credit quality indicators and could lead to a lower provision
for loan losses in 2004 than in 2003.

The  efficiency  ratio  (defined as  noninterest  expense  divided by the sum of
taxable  equivalent net interest income plus noninterest  income,  excluding net
asset and  securities  gains)  was  49.84%  for 2003 and  49.95%  for 2002.  The
Corporation has and will continue to monitor costs.

Performance Summary

The  Corporation  recorded  net  income of  $228.7  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2003, an increase of $18.0 million or 8.5% over the $210.7  million
earned in 2002.  Basic  earnings per share for 2003 were $3.10,  a 9.9% increase
over 2002 basic  earnings per share of $2.82.  Earnings  per diluted  share were
$3.07, a 10.0% increase over 2002 diluted earnings per share of $2.79. Return on
average  assets  and return on  average  equity for 2003 were 1.53% and  17.58%,
respectively,  compared  to 1.47%  and  17.10%,  respectively,  for  2002.  Cash
dividends  of $1.33 per share  paid in 2003  increased  by 9.9% over  2002.  Key
factors behind these results were:

o    Taxable  equivalent net interest income was $535.7 million for 2003,  $10.3
     million or 2.0%  higher than 2002.  Although  taxable  equivalent  interest
     income  decreased  $63.9  million,  interest  expense  decreased  by  $74.2
     million.  The  increase  in  taxable  equivalent  net  interest  income was
     attributable to favorable  volume  variances (with balance sheet growth and
     differences   in  the  mix  of   average   earning   assets   and   average
     interest-bearing liabilities adding $21.6 million to taxable equivalent net
     interest  income),  offset  partly by  unfavorable  rate  variances (as the
     impact  of  changes  in  the  interest  rate  environment  reduced  taxable
     equivalent net interest  income by $11.3  million).  Average earning assets
     increased $652 million to $13.9 billion, while interest-bearing liabilities
     increased $459 million to $11.9 billion.

o    Net interest  income and net interest  margin were  impacted in 2003 by the
     sustained low interest rate  environment,  competitive  pricing  pressures,
     higher  earning  asset  balances,  and total  deposit  growth.  The average
     Federal  funds rate of 1.12% in 2003 was 55 basis points  ("bp") lower than
     the 1.67% average rate in 2002.

o    The net interest margin for 2003 was 3.84%,  compared to 3.95% in 2002. The
     11 bp decrease in net interest  margin is attributable to the net of a 3 bp
     decrease in interest  rate spread (the net of a 75 bp decrease in the yield
     on  earning  assets,  substantially  offset  by  a  72  bp  lower  cost  of
     interest-bearing liabilities), and an 8 bp lower contribution from net free
     funds.

o    Total loans were $10.3 billion at December 31, 2003,  relatively  unchanged
     from December 31, 2002.  Commercial  loan balances grew $188 million (3.0%)
     and represented 63% of total loans at December 31, 2003, compared to 61% at
     year-end  2002.  Total  deposits were $9.8 billion at December 31, 2003, an
     increase  of $668  million  or 7.3% from  year-end  2002,  particularly  in
     lower-costing deposits.

o    Asset quality was affected by the impact of challenging economic conditions
     on  customers.  Net charge  offs were $31.7  million,  an  increase of $3.4
     million over 2002, with the majority of the increase attributable to charge
     offs in the  commercial  loan  portfolio.  Net  charge  offs were  0.30% of
     average  loans  compared to 0.28% in 2002.  The  provision  for loan losses
     decreased to $46.8 million  compared to $50.7 million in 2002. The ratio of
     allowance for loan losses to loans was 1.73% and 1.58% at December 31, 2003
     and  2002,   respectively.   Nonperforming   loans  were  $121.5   million,
     representing  1.18% of total  loans at  year-end  2003,  compared  to $99.3
     million or 0.96% of total loans at year-end 2002.

o    Noninterest  income was $246.4  million  for 2003,  $30.6  million or 14.2%
     higher  than 2002,  led by strong  results in  mortgage  banking and retail
     commissions.  Mortgage  banking revenue  increased $16.6 million (25.0%) to
     $83.0 million, driven by strong secondary mortgage production and resultant
     loan  sales.  Retail  commissions  grew $7.3  million  (40.0%)  over  2002,
     primarily  attributable to the acquisition of CFG Insurance Services,  Inc.
     ("CFG") in April 2003 (see section "Business Combinations").

o    Noninterest expense was $388.7 million, up $18.6 million or 5.0% over 2002,
     due principally to personnel expense.  Personnel expense rose $19.0 million
     or 10.0%,  primarily due to the timing of acquisitions  and merit increases
     between the years.

o    Income tax expense  increased to $93.1 million,  up $7.5 million from 2002.
     The increase was primarily  attributable to higher net income before tax as
     the effective tax rate was unchanged at 28.9%.

Business Combinations

In 2003 there was one  completed  business  combination.  On April 1, 2003,  the
Corporation  consummated its cash acquisition of 100% of the outstanding  shares
of CFG, a closely held insurance agency headquartered in Minnetonka,  Minnesota.
Effective June 2003, CFG operated as Associated  Financial  Group,  LLC. CFG, an
independent,  full-line  insurance agency, was acquired to enhance the growth of
the Corporation's existing insurance business. The acquisition was accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting;  thus, the results of operations  prior
to the  consummation  date were not  included in the  accompanying  consolidated
financial   statements.   Goodwill  of  approximately   $12  million  and  other
intangibles  of  approximately  $15 million  recognized  in the  transaction  at
acquisition were assigned to the wealth management segment.

There was one completed business  combination during 2002. On February 28, 2002,
the Corporation  consummated  its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding  common
shares of Signal Financial Corporation  ("Signal"),  a financial holding company
headquartered in Mendota Heights, Minnesota. Signal operated banking branches in
nine  locations  in the Twin  Cities and Eastern  Minnesota.  As a result of the
acquisition,  the Corporation  expanded its Minnesota presence,  particularly in
the Twin  Cities  area.  The Signal  transaction  was  consummated  through  the
issuance of  approximately  4.1 million shares of common stock and $58.4 million
in cash for a  purchase  price of $192.5  million.  The value of the  shares was
determined using the closing stock price of the Corporation's stock on September
10, 2001,  the initiation  date of the  transaction.  Goodwill of  approximately
$119.7 million and other intangibles of approximately $5.6 million recognized in
the  transaction  were  assigned to the banking  segment.  The  acquisition  was
accounted  for under the purchase  method of  accounting;  thus,  the results of
operations prior to the consummation  date were not included in the accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements.  There were no business combinations during
2001. The Corporation's  business  combination activity is further summarized in
Note  2,  "Business  Combinations,"  of  the  notes  to  consolidated  financial
statements.

INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income

Net interest income in the consolidated statements of income (which excludes the
taxable equivalent adjustment) was $510.8 million, compared to $501.3 million in
2002. The taxable  equivalent  adjustments  (the adjustments to bring tax-exempt
interest to a level that would yield the same  after-tax  income had that income
been  subject to  taxation  using a 35% tax rate) of $24.9  million for 2003 and
$24.0 million for 2002 resulted in fully taxable  equivalent net interest income
of $535.7 million and $525.3 million, respectively.

Net interest  income is the primary  source of the  Corporation's  revenue.  Net
interest  income is the difference  between  interest  income on earning assets,
such as loans and  securities,  and the  interest  expense  on  interest-bearing
deposits and other borrowings used to fund  interest-earning and other assets or
activities. The amount of net interest income is affected by changes in interest
rates and by the amount and  composition of earning assets and  interest-bearing
liabilities. Additionally, net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of
the balance sheet to changes in interest rates, which factors in characteristics
such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial  instruments,  contractual
maturities, repricing frequencies, and the use of interest rate swaps and caps.

Interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain
changes in net interest income.  Interest rate spread is the difference  between
the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for  interest-bearing  liabilities
that fund those assets.  The net interest  margin is expressed as the percentage
of net  interest  income to average  earning  assets.  The net  interest  margin
exceeds the interest rate spread  because  noninterest-bearing  sources of funds
("net free funds"),  principally demand deposits and stockholders'  equity, also
support earning assets.  To compare  tax-exempt  asset yields to taxable yields,
the yield on tax-exempt loans and securities is computed on a taxable equivalent
basis.  Net interest income,  interest rate spread,  and net interest margin are
discussed on a taxable equivalent basis.

Table 2  provides  average  balances  of  earning  assets  and  interest-bearing
liabilities,  the associated interest income and expense,  and the corresponding
interest  rates earned and paid, as well as net interest  income,  interest rate
spread,  and net  interest  margin on a taxable  equivalent  basis for the three
years ended December 31, 2003. Tables 3 through 5 present additional information
to  facilitate  the review and  discussion  of taxable  equivalent  net interest
income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin.

Taxable  equivalent net interest income was $535.7 million for 2003, an increase
of $10.3  million or 2.0% from 2002.  The  increase  in taxable  equivalent  net
interest  income was a function of a higher level of earning  assets,  offset by
unfavorable  interest rate changes.  The net interest margin for 2003 was 3.84%,
compared  to 3.95% in 2002.  The 11 bp  compression  in net  interest  margin is
attributable  to a 3 bp decrease in interest  rate spread (with a 75 bp decrease
in the yield on earning  assets,  substantially  offset by a 72 bp lower cost of
interest-bearing  liabilities),  and an 8 bp  lower  contribution  from net free
funds  (impacted  by the lower  2003 rate  environment,  despite a $194  million
increase in average net free funds).  Interest rates were  generally  stable and
historically  low during both 2003 and 2002.  Comparatively,  the Federal  funds
rate at December  31, 2003,  was at a 45-year low of 1.00%,  25 bp lower than at
December 31, 2002, while the average Federal funds rate for 2003 was 55 bp lower
than for 2002.

As shown in the  rate/volume  analysis  in Table 3, volume  changes  added $21.6
million to taxable  equivalent net interest income,  while rate changes resulted
in an $11.3 million decrease, for a net increase of $10.3 million. From a volume
perspective,  the growth and  composition  change of earning  assets added $31.3
million to taxable  equivalent net interest income in 2003, while the growth and
composition of  interest-bearing  liabilities  cost an additional  $9.7 million,
netting a $21.6 million increase to taxable equivalent net interest income. Rate
changes on earning assets reduced  interest  income by $95.2 million,  while the
changes in rates on  interest-bearing  liabilities  lowered  interest expense by
$83.9 million, for a net unfavorable impact of $11.3 million.

For 2003, the yield on earning assets fell 75 bp to 5.39%,  driven  primarily by
an 81 bp  decline  in  the  loan  yield.  The  average  loan  yield  was  5.46%.
Competitive  pricing on new and  refinanced  loans and the repricing of variable
rate loans in the lower interest rate environment put downward  pressure on loan
yields in 2003. The yield on securities and short-term  investments combined was
down 54 bp to 5.19%.  The earning asset rate changes reduced  interest income by
$95.2 million,  a combination of $77.5 million lower interest on loans and $17.7
million lower interest on securities and short-term investments combined.

For 2003,  the cost of  interest-bearing  liabilities  decreased 72 bp to 1.83%,
aided  by  the  lower  rate   environment.   The   combined   average   cost  of
interest-bearing  deposits was 1.62%,  down 66 bp from 2002,  benefiting  from a
larger mix of lower-costing transaction accounts, as well as from lower rates on
interest-bearing  deposit  products  in  general.  The cost of  wholesale  funds
(comprised of all short-term  borrowings and long-term  funding) decreased 85 bp
to 2.21% for 2003,  favorably  impacted  by lower rates  year-over-year  and the
maturity of higher-rate  wholesale  funds during the year. The  interest-bearing
liability rate changes  resulted in $83.9 million lower interest  expense,  with
$42.8 million attributable to interest-bearing deposits and $41.1 million due to
wholesale funding.

Average  earning assets were $13.9 billion in 2003, an increase of $652 million,
or 4.9%,  from 2002.  Loans  accounted for the majority of the growth in earning
assets, increasing by $620 million, or 6.2%, to $10.6 billion on average in 2003
and representing 76.2% of average earning assets compared to 75.2% for 2002. For
2003, taxable  equivalent  interest income on loans increased $29.9 million from
growth,  but decreased $77.5 million from the impact of the low rate environment
(as noted  above),  for a net  decrease of $47.6  million  versus last year (See
Table 3). Balances of securities and short-term  investments  combined increased
$32 million on average.  Taxable  equivalent  interest  income on securities and
short-term  investments for 2003 increased $1.4 million from volume changes, but
decreased $17.7 million from the impact of the rate environment, for a net $16.3
million decrease to taxable equivalent interest income.

Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $459 million, or 4.0%, from 2002,
while net free funds  increased  $194  million,  both  supporting  the growth in
earning assets. Average  noninterest-bearing demand deposits (a component of net
free funds) increased by $180 million, or 12.0%. Interest-bearing deposits grew,
on average,  $207 million, or 2.8%, to $7.6 billion, the net result of increases
in  interest-bearing  demand and savings  deposits  and declines in money market
accounts and time deposits.  Interest expense on  interest-bearing  deposits for
2003  decreased  $42.8  million  from the  impact  of the rate  environment  and
decreased  $3.1  million from volume and mix  changes,  for a net $45.9  million
decrease to interest  expense.  Average  wholesale  funding sources increased by
$251  million.  The  Corporation  continued  its  shift of  funding  (given  the
continued low rate environment)  from short-term  borrowing sources to long-term
funding,  increasing its average  long-term  funding by $424 million to 17.7% of
average  interest-bearing  liabilities  (compared to 14.7% for 2002).  For 2003,
interest expense on wholesale  funding  increased by $12.8 million due to volume
changes and decreased by $41.1  million from lower rates,  for a net decrease of
$28.3 million versus the prior year.

Provision for Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses in 2003 was $46.8 million.  The provision for loan
losses for 2002 was $50.7  million,  and $28.2 million for 2001. At December 31,
2003,  the  allowance  for loan  losses was $177.6  million,  compared to $162.5
million at December 31,  2002,  and $128.2  million at December  31,  2001.  Net
charge offs were $31.7 million for 2003,  compared to $28.3 million for 2002 and
$20.2  million  for 2001.  Net charge  offs as a percent  of average  loans were
0.30%, 0.28%, and 0.22% for 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The ratio of the
allowance  for loan losses to total  loans was 1.73%,  up from 1.58% at December
31, 2002,  and 1.42% at December 31, 2001.  Nonperforming  loans at December 31,
2003, were $121.5  million,  compared to $99.3 million at December 31, 2002, and
$52.1 million at December 31, 2001.

The provision for loan losses is predominantly a function of the methodology and
other qualitative and quantitative factors used to determine the adequacy of the
allowance  for loan losses which focuses on

                                       22

changes in the size and  character of the loan  portfolio,  changes in levels of
impaired and other  nonperforming  loans,  historical  losses on each  portfolio
category,  the risk  inherent  in  specific  loans,  concentrations  of loans to
specific borrowers or industries,  existing economic conditions,  the fair value
of underlying collateral,  and other factors which could affect potential credit
losses. See additional  discussion under sections,  "Allowance for Loan Losses,"
and "Nonperforming Loans, Potential Problem Loans, and Other Real Estate Owned."

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income was $246.4 million for 2003, $30.6 million or 14.2% higher
than 2002. Fee income as a percentage of total revenues (defined as total
noninterest income less gains or losses on asset and investment sales ("fee
income") divided by taxable equivalent net interest income plus fee income) was
31.3% for 2003 compared to 29.1% for 2002.

Trust  service fees for 2003 were $29.6  million,  up $1.7  million  (6.1%) from
2002. The change was predominantly the result of new business,  increases in the
fee structure on personal trust  accounts,  and an improving  stock market.  The
market  value of assets under  management  was $4.1 billion at December 31, 2003
compared to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2002, reflecting higher year-end equity
values compared to 2002.

Service  charges on deposit  accounts were $50.3  million,  $4.3 million  (9.3%)
higher than 2002. The increase was a function of higher volumes  associated with
the larger deposit  account base,  higher service  charges on business  accounts
(attributable   to  lower   earnings   credit   rates),   and  higher   fees  on
overdrafts/nonsufficient funds.

Mortgage banking income consists of servicing fees, the gain or loss on sales of
mortgage loans to the secondary market, and other related fees. Mortgage banking
income was $83.0  million in 2003,  an increase  of $16.6  million or 25.0% over
2002. The increase was primarily a result of increased  income  associated  with
higher secondary  mortgage loan production  (mortgage loan production to be sold
to the secondary market) and resultant sales. Secondary mortgage loan production
was $4.3  billion for 2003,  up 34.2% over the $3.2  billion for 2002.  Gains on
loan sales were up $14.1 million (the net of realized gains up $20.3 million and
a $6.2 million decline in the fair value of the mortgage derivatives  position).
The mortgage  portfolio serviced for others was $5.9 billion and $5.4 billion at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Credit card and other nondeposit fees were $23.7 million for 2003, a decrease of
$3.8 million or 13.9% from 2002, primarily  attributable to lower merchant fees,
given the merchant  processing sale and services agreement  consummated in March
2003. In February 2003, the Corporation entered into a 10-year agreement with an
outside vendor to provide  merchant  processing  services for the  Corporation's
merchant  customers.  The agreement resulted in a gain of $3.4 million (recorded
in other  noninterest  income) and replaces  gross  merchant  discount fees with
revenue  sharing  on new and  existing  merchant  business  over the life of the
agreement.  Thus,  credit  card fees were down $5.7  million  versus  2002 (i.e.
reduced merchant  discount fees,  offset partly by increased  inclearing  fees),
while other nondeposit fees were up $1.9 million (primarily CFG-related advisory
fees).

Retail  commission  income  (which  includes   commissions  from  insurance  and
brokerage product sales) was $25.6 million, up $7.3 million or 40.0% compared to
2002.  Other  insurance  revenues  were up $8.6 million,  while fixed  annuities
commissions  decreased  $2.0  million.  Other  insurance  revenue was  favorably
impacted  by the CFG  acquisition  but  offset  partly by lower  loan  insurance
commissions,  which were affected by legislation  in late 2002 requiring  single
premium  credit  insurance  premiums on loans with real  estate to be  collected
based on monthly outstanding balances. Fixed annuities commissions declined
during 2003, in part due to the prolonged low rate environment, customer
preference for more attractive rate-driven products, and the recent recovery in
the equity markets. Brokerage commissions, including variable annuities, were up
$0.7 million, reflecting recent renewed customer interest in the stock market.

Other income was $18.2  million for 2003, an increase of $2.5 million over 2002.
Other income for 2003 included a $1.5 million gain on the sale of  out-of-market
credit card accounts and a $3.4 million gain  recognized in connection  with the
aforementioned  credit card  merchant  processing  sale and services  agreement.
Change in vendor  arrangements  for both ATM services and check printing lowered
revenue   (down   $1.2   million   and  $0.6   million,   respectively),   while
correspondingly  lowered  ATM  and  check  printing  costs  (included  in  Other
expense).  Other  income for 2002  included a $0.5  million  gain on the sale of
stock in a regional ATM network.

Asset  sale  gains for 2003 were $1.6  million,  including  a $1.3  million  net
premium on the sales of $17 million in  deposits  from two  branches  and a $0.4
million net gain on the sale of other real estate owned  properties.  Asset sale
gains for 2002 were $0.7 million.  Investment securities net gains for 2003 were
$0.7  million,  attributable  to a $1.0  million  gain on the sale of Sallie Mae
stock, partially offset by of a $0.3 million  other-than-temporary write down on
a  collateralized  mortgage  obligation  ("CMO")  security.  The 2002 investment
securities   net   losses   of   $0.4   million    included   a   $0.8   million
other-than-temporary write down on the same CMO security.

Personnel  expense  (including   salary-related   expenses  and  fringe  benefit
expenses)  increased $19.0 million or 10.0% over 2002 and  represented  53.5% of
total noninterest  expense in 2003 compared to 51.1% in 2002.  Average full-time
equivalent  employees  were 4,123 for 2003,  compared  to 4,072 for 2002.  Total
salary-related  expenses increased $15.8 million or 10.9% in 2003, primarily due
to the timing of acquisitions,  increased severance, and merit increases between
the years. Fringe benefits increased $3.2 million or 7.3% in 2003,  attributable
to the increased  cost of premium  based  benefits (up $1.2 million or 8.1%) and
other fringe  benefit  expenses  commensurate  with the  salary-related  expense
increase.

Occupancy  expense  increased  7.8% to  support  the  larger  branch  and office
network, particularly attributable to the Signal and CFG acquisitions. Equipment
expense  declined  principally  in  computer  depreciation  expense due to aging
equipment and lower replacement  costs. Data processing costs increased to $23.3
million, up $2.2 million or 10.7% over 2002, due to processing for a larger base
operation,  as well as web-based  and other  technology  enhancements.  Business
development and advertising increased to $15.2 million for 2003, up $1.4 million
or 10.0% compared to 2002.

Mortgage servicing rights expense includes both the amortization of the mortgage
servicing  rights asset and  increases or decreases to the  valuation  allowance
associated with the mortgage  servicing rights asset.  Mortgage servicing rights
expense  decreased  by $0.9  million  between  2003 and 2002,  including a $12.3
million  addition  to the  valuation  allowance  during 2003 (the net of a $15.8
million addition to the valuation allowance in the first nine months of 2003 and
a $3.5 million  reversal to the  valuation  allowance  in the fourth  quarter of
2003) versus a $17.6 million addition to the valuation allowance during 2002 and
a $4.4 million  increase in the  amortization of the mortgage  servicing  rights
asset.  While the strong mortgage  refinance activity benefited mortgage banking
income,  it  increased  the  prepayment  speeds  of the  Corporation's  mortgage
portfolio  serviced for others,  a key factor  behind the  valuation of mortgage
servicing  rights.  However,  during the second  half of 2003 (and  particularly
fourth  quarter  2003),  mortgage  interest  rates began to rise,  slowing  both
prepayment  speeds and  mortgage  refinance  activity.  See Note 1,  "Summary of
Significant  Accounting  Policies,"  of  the  notes  to  consolidated  financial
statements for the Corporation's accounting policy for mortgage servicing rights

                                       25
<PAGE>

and  section  "Critical  Accounting  Policies."  Mortgage  servicing  rights are
considered a critical  accounting policy given that estimating the fair value of
the mortgage  servicing  rights  involves  judgment,  particularly  of estimated
prepayment speeds of the underlying  mortgages serviced and the overall level of
interest rates. Loan type and note rate are the predominant risk characteristics
of the underlying loans used to stratify  capitalized  mortgage servicing rights
for purposes of measuring  impairment.  A valuation  allowance is established to
the extent the  carrying  value of the  mortgage  servicing  rights  exceeds the
estimated  fair  value  by  stratification.  Net  income  could be  affected  if
management's  estimates  of  the  prepayment  speeds  or  other  factors  differ
materially  from  actual  prepayments.  An  other-than-temporary  impairment  is
recognized  as a  write-down  of the  mortgage  servicing  rights  asset and the
related  valuation  allowance (to the extent valuation reserve is available) and
then against  earnings.  A direct  write-down  permanently  reduces the carrying
value of the mortgage servicing rights asset and valuation allowance, precluding
subsequent recoveries.  Mortgage servicing rights,  included in other intangible
assets on the  consolidated  balance sheet,  were $42.5 million,  net of a $22.6
million  valuation  allowance at December 31, 2003, and represented 72 bp of the
$5.9 billion  portfolio of residential  mortgage loans serviced for others.  See
Note 5,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets," of the notes to  consolidated
financial statements for additional disclosure.

Intangible  amortization  expense  increased to $3.0  million,  primarily due to
additional core deposit and other  intangible  assets  resulting from the Signal
and CFG  acquisitions.  Loan  expense was $7.6  million,  down $7.0 million from
2002,  predominantly due to lower merchant  processing costs,  given the sale of
the merchant  processing  during the first  quarter of 2003 (as noted in section
"Noninterest Income"). Other expense was up $3.7 million over 2002, attributable
primarily to a $2.5  million  charge on  commercial  letters of credit given the
deterioration of the financial condition of a borrower,  and $1.1 million higher
foreclosure  costs  (including a $0.5 million write down on one commercial other
real estate owned property).

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for 2003 was $93.1 million,  up $7.5 million from 2002 income
tax expense of $85.6 million.  The Corporation's  effective tax rate (income tax
expense divided by income before taxes) was 28.9% in both 2003 and 2002.

See Note 1,  "Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies,"  of the  notes to
consolidated  financial  statements for the Corporation's  income tax accounting
policy and section "Critical  Accounting  Policies." Income tax expense recorded
in the consolidated statements of income involves interpretation and application
of certain  accounting  pronouncements  and federal and state tax codes, and is,
therefore,  considered a critical  accounting policy. The Corporation  undergoes
examination by various taxing  authorities.  Such taxing authorities may require
that changes in the amount of tax expense or valuation  allowance be  recognized
when  their  interpretations  differ  from those of  management,  based on their
judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations.
See Note 13, "Income Taxes," of the notes to consolidated  financial  statements
for more information.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Loans

Total loans were $10.3 billion at December 31, 2003,  relatively unchanged (down
$11 million or 0.1%) from December 31, 2002. Commercial loans were $6.5 billion,
up $188 million or 3.0%.  Commercial  loans grew to represent 63% of total loans
at the end of 2003, up from 61% at year-end 2002. Home equity and other consumer
loans  combined  grew $86  million or 5.4%,  while  residential  mortgage  loans

</TABLE>

Commercial,  financial,  and agricultural  loans were $2.1 billion at the end of
2003,  down $98 million or 4.4% since  year-end 2002, and comprised 21% of total
loans outstanding, down from 22% at the end of 2002. The commercial,  financial,
and agricultural loan  classification  primarily consists of commercial loans to
middle  market  companies  and  small  businesses.  Loans of this  type are in a
diverse  range of  industries.  The credit risk related to  commercial  loans is
largely influenced by general economic  conditions and the resulting impact on a
borrower's  operations.  Borrower  demand in this loan sector has been  cautious
during  2003,  and price  competition  has been strong.  Within the  commercial,
financial,  and  agricultural  classification,  loans  to  finance  agricultural
production totaled only 0.3% of total loans at both December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Real  estate  construction  loans grew $167  million  or 18.4% to $1.1  billion,
representing  10% of the total loan  portfolio  at the end of 2003,  compared to
$911  million  or 9% at the  end of  2002.  Loans  in  this  classification  are
primarily short-term interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or
development of commercial real estate,  such as multifamily or other  commercial
development projects.  Real estate construction loans are made to developers and
project  managers who are well known to the  Corporation,  have prior successful
project  experience,  and are well  capitalized.  Projects  undertaken  by these
developers  are carefully  reviewed by the  Corporation  to ensure that they are
economically viable. Loans of this type are primarily made to customers based in
the  Corporation's  tri-state  market in which the  Corporation  has a  thorough
knowledge  of the local market  economy.  The credit risk  associated  with real
estate  construction loans is generally  confined to specific  geographic areas,
but is also influenced by general economic conditions.  The Corporation controls
the credit risk on these types of loans by making  loans in familiar  markets to
developers,  underwriting  the loans to meet the  requirements of  institutional
investors in the secondary market,  reviewing the merits of individual projects,
controlling  loan structure,  and monitoring  project  progress and construction
advances.

Commercial  real  estate   includes  loans  secured  by  farmland,   multifamily
properties, and nonfarm/nonresidential  real estate properties.  Commercial real
estate  totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2003,  up $118 million or 3.8% over
December 31, 2002,  and comprised 32% of total loans  outstanding  versus 30% at
year-end 2002.  Commercial  real estate loans involve  borrower  characteristics
similar  to  those  discussed  above  for  commercial   loans  and  real  estate
construction projects. Loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial
properties,  multifamily properties, and community purpose properties. Loans are
primarily made to customers based in Wisconsin,  Illinois, and Minnesota. Credit
risk is  managed  in a  similar  manner  to  commercial  loans  and real  estate
construction by employing sound underwriting guidelines, lending to borrowers in
local markets and businesses,  and formally  reviewing the borrower's  financial
soundness and  relationship  on an ongoing basis.  In many cases the Corporation
will take  additional  real  estate  collateral  to further  secure the  overall
lending relationship.

Residential real estate loans totaled $3.1 billion at the end of 2003, down $181
million or 5.5% from the prior year and comprised 30% of total loans outstanding
versus 32% at year-end 2002. Loans in this  classification  include  residential
mortgage (which consists of  conventional  home mortgages and second  mortgages)
and home equity lines.  Residential  mortgage loans  generally limit the maximum
loan to 80% of collateral value. Residential mortgage loans were $2.1 billion at
December  31,  2003,  down $285  million or 11.7%  compared  to the prior  year,
principally due to high refinance  activity prompted by lower interest rates and
the subsequent  sale of newer,  fixed-rate  loan  production  into the secondary
market.  Home equity lines grew by $104  million,  or 12.0%,  to $969 million in
2003, an attractive product to consumers given the lower rate environment and an
area of emphasis in 2003.

Consumer  loans to individuals  totaled $698 million at December 31, 2003,  down
$18  million or 2.6%  compared to 2002,  representing  7% of the  year-end  loan
portfolio.  Consumer  loans include  short-term  installment  loans,  direct and
indirect automobile loans,  recreational vehicle loans, credit card loans (which
are primarily  business-oriented),  student  loans,  and other  personal  loans.
Individual  borrowers  may  be  required  to  provide  related  collateral  or a
satisfactory  endorsement  or guaranty  from  another  person,  depending on the
specific type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower.  Credit risk for
these  types  of loans is  generally  greatly  influenced  by  general  economic
conditions,  the characteristics of individual borrowers,  and the nature of the
loan  collateral.   Credit  risk  is  primarily   controlled  by  reviewing  the
creditworthiness  of the borrowers as well as taking appropriate  collateral and
guaranty positions.

Factors that are important to managing  overall  credit  quality are sound loan
underwriting  and  administration,  systematic  monitoring of existing loans and
commitments,  effective loan review on an ongoing basis, early identification of
potential problems,  an adequate allowance for loan losses, and sound nonaccrual
and charge off policies.

An active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to further
ensure  that sound and  consistent  credit  decisions  are made.  Credit risk is
controlled   by   detailed   underwriting    procedures,    comprehensive   loan
administration,   and  periodic  review  of  borrowers'  outstanding  loans  and
commitments.  Borrower  relationships  are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis
for early  identification of potential  problems.  Further analyses by customer,
industry,  and geographic  location are performed to monitor  trends,  financial
performance, and concentrations.

The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups,
and  market  areas  within  our  primary  three-state  area.   Significant  loan
concentrations  are considered to exist for a financial  institution  when there
are amounts  loaned to numerous  borrowers  engaged in similar  activities  that
would cause them to be similarly  impacted by economic or other  conditions.  At
December 31, 2003, no significant  concentrations  existed in the  Corporation's
portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to credit risk. Credit risks are
inherently different for each loan type. Credit risk is controlled and monitored
through the use of lending standards,  a thorough review of potential borrowers,
and  on-going  review  of  loan  payment   performance.   Active  asset  quality
administration,   including  early  problem  loan   identification   and  timely
resolution of problems,  aids in the management of credit risk and  minimization
of loan losses.  Credit risk management for each loan type is discussed  briefly
in the section entitled "Loans."

The  allowance  for loan losses  represents  management's  estimate of an amount
adequate to provide for  probable  credit  losses in the loan  portfolio  at the
balance sheet date. To assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses,  an
allocation methodology is applied by the Corporation which focuses on changes in
the size and character of the loan  portfolio,  changes in levels of impaired or
other nonperforming  loans, the risk inherent in specific loans,  concentrations
of loans to specific  borrowers or  industries,  existing  economic  conditions,
underlying  collateral,  historical losses on each portfolio category, and other
qualitative and quantitative  factors which could affect probable credit losses.
Assessing these factors involves significant judgment.  Management considers the
allowance for loan losses a critical  accounting  policy (see section  "Critical
Accounting  Policies").  See management's  allowance for loan losses  accounting
policy in Note 1,  "Summary of  Significant  Accounting  Policies,"  and Note 4,
"Loans,"  of the  notes to  consolidated  financial  statements  for  additional
allowance for loan losses disclosures.

At December 31, 2003, the allowance for loan losses was $177.6 million, compared
to $162.5  million at December 31, 2002, and $128.2 million at year-end 2001. As
of December 31, 2003, the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.73% and
covered 146% of nonperforming loans,  compared to 1.58% and 164%,  respectively,
at December 31, 2002,  and 1.42% and 246%,  respectively,  at December 31, 2001.
Total loans were  relatively  unchanged at $10.3  billion for both  December 31,
2003 and 2002,  though  commercial  loans  (defined as  commercial  real estate;
commercial,  financial and agricultural  loans; real estate  construction loans;
and lease  financing) grew $188 million.  From year-end 2001 to 2002, loans were
up $1.3 billion (with $760 million in loans from the Signal  acquisition),  with
growth particularly in commercial loans (up $1.1 billion).  With this growth and
impacts  of the  sluggish  economy  on various  borrowers,  nonperforming  loans
trended  upward,  to $121.5 million at December 31, 2003, from $99.3 million and
$52.1  million at  year-end  2002 and 2001,  respectively.  Net charge offs were
$31.7  million,  $28.3  million  and  $20.2  million  for  2003,  2002 and 2001,
respectively.  The provision for loan losses is  predominantly a function of the
result of the methodology and other qualitative and quantitative factors used to
determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  The provision for loan
losses was $46.8  million,  $50.7 million and $28.2  million for 2003,  2002 and
2001,  respectively.  Tables 10 and 11 provide additional  information regarding
activity  in the  allowance  for  loan  losses,  Table  12  provides  additional
information  regarding  nonperforming loans, and Table 8 provides information on
loan growth and composition.

Net charge offs were $31.7 million or 0.30% of average loans for 2003,  compared
to $28.3 million or 0.28% of average loans for 2002,  and $20.2 million or 0.22%
of average  loans for 2001 (see  Table 10).  The $3.4  million  increase  in net
charge offs for 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to commercial net charge
offs.  Commercial  net charge offs for 2003 were $24.3  million (up $4.0 million
compared  to 2002) and as a percent of total net charge  offs were 76%,  72% and
76% for 2003,  2002 and 2001,  respectively.  Specifically,  net charge  offs of
commercial  real estate  loans were $13.0  million,  up $7.7  million over 2002,
while net charge offs of commercial, financial, and agricultural loans were $9.7
million,  down $3.7 million.  Five commercial  credits in the  construction  and
hospitality industries accounted for approximately $16.5 million of the 2003 net
charge offs.  Several  commercial credits with greater than $0.5 million charged
off accounted for approximately $13.0 million of the 2002 net charge offs. Loans
charged off are subject to continuous  review, and specific efforts are taken to
achieve maximum recovery of principal, accrued interest, and related expenses.

The  change  in the  allowance  for loan  losses  is a  function  of a number of
factors,  including but not limited to changes in the loan  portfolio (see Table
8), net charge offs (see Table 10), and  nonperforming  loans (see Table 12). As
previously  discussed,  total loans from year-end  2002 to 2003 were  relatively
flat (down $11 million or 0.1%); however, the loan mix shifted.  During 2003 the
commercial  loan portfolio grew to represent 63% of total loans at year-end 2003
compared  to 61% last  year-end.  This  segment  of the loan  portfolio  carries
greater  inherent credit risk  (described  under section  "Loans").  With growth
particularly in commercial  loans and impacts of the sluggish economy on various
borrowers, nonperforming loans to total loans grew to 1.18% for 2003 compared to
0.96% for 2002. Net charge offs for 2003  increased to $31.7  million,  with the
majority of the  increase  attributable  to charge offs in the  commercial  loan
portfolio.

The allocation of the Corporation's  allowance for loan losses for the last five
years  is  shown  in  Table  11.  The  allocation  methodology  applied  by  the
Corporation,  designed to assess the adequacy of the  allowance for loan losses,
focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan  portfolio,  changes in
levels of impaired and other nonperforming  loans, the risk inherent in specific
loans,  concentrations  of loans to specific  borrowers or industries,  existing
economic conditions,  underlying collateral, historical losses on each portfolio
category,  and other qualitative and quantitative  factors.  Because each of the
criteria  used is subject to change,  the  allocation  of the allowance for loan
losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily  indicative of the
trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category. The total allowance
is  available  to absorb  losses from any segment of the  portfolio.  Management
continues  to target and  maintain  the  allowance  for loan losses equal to the
allocation  methodology plus an unallocated  portion,  as determined by economic
conditions  and  other  qualitative  and  quantitative   factors  affecting  the
Corporation's borrowers.  Management allocates the allowance for loan losses for
credit losses by pools of risk. The commercial  loan  allocations are based on a
quarterly review of individual  loans,  loan types,  and industries.  The retail
loan  (residential  mortgage,  home equity,  and  consumer)  allocation is based
primarily on analysis of historical  delinquency  and charge off  statistics and
trends.  Minimum  loss  factors  used by the  Corporation  for  criticized  loan
categories are  consistent  with  regulatory  agency  factors.  Loss factors for
non-criticized loan categories are based primarily on loan type, historical loan
loss  experience,  and  industry  statistics.  The  mechanism  used  to  address
differences between estimated and actual loan loss experience includes review of
recent  nonperforming loan trends,  underwriting  trends,  external factors, and
management's judgment relating to current assumptions.

The  allocation  methods used for  December  31, 2003 and 2002 were  comparable.
Factors used for criticized loans (defined as specific loans  warranting  either
specific   allocation  or  a  criticized  status  of  watch,   special  mention,
substandard,  doubtful or loss), as well as for non-criticized  loan categories,
were unchanged  between the years.  At both December 31, 2003 and 2002,  current
economic  conditions  carried  various  uncertainties   requiring   management's
judgment  as to the  impact  on the  business  results  of  numerous  individual
borrowers and certain industries.  Additionally, the pace at which the financial
results of a borrower's  company can take a downturn from challenging and varied
economic  conditions  continued to be a factor for both years. At year-end 2003,
57% of the  allowance  (compared  to 55% at  year-end  2002)  was  allocated  to
criticized loans, including $10 million of allowance identified for a previously
disclosed  commercial  manufacturing credit ($17 million outstanding at December
31, 2003) for which management had doubts  concerning the future  collectibility
of the loan.  The  primary  shift in the  allowance  allocation  was the  amount
allocated  to  commercial  real estate loans at year-end  2003,  which was $69.9
million,  representing  39% (compared to 35% at year-end  2002) of the allowance
for loan losses.  A greater amount of these loans were in criticized  categories
(10% versus 9% at year-end  2002);  charge offs of this loan type  increased (to
$13.7  million  for 2003,  more than  double)  between  the years;  these  loans
represented 44% of  nonperforming  loans (compared to 24% at year-end 2002); and
commercial  real estate loans grew to  represent  32% of total loans at December
31, 2003 (compared to 30% at year-end 2002). As noted under the section "Loans,"
the credit  risk of this loan  category is largely  influenced  by the impact on
borrowers  of  general  economic  conditions,   which  have  been  noted  to  be
challenging and uncertain. The allowance allocated to commercial, financial, and
agricultural loans was $63.9 million at year-end 2003,  representing 36% (versus
40% at year-end  2002) of the

                                       31
<PAGE>

allowance for loan losses. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans declined
4.4% since  year-end  2002, to represent 21% of total loans at December 31, 2003
compared to 22% at December  31, 2002;  net charge offs were $9.7 million  (down
$3.7 million);  and as a percent of nonperforming loans, these loans represented
36% (versus 48% at year-end 2002).

The  allocation  methods used for  December  31, 2002 and 2001 were  comparable.
Factors  used  for  criticized  loans,  as  well  as  for  non-criticized   loan
categories,  were  unchanged  between the years.  At both  December 31, 2002 and
2001,  current  economic  conditions  carried  various  uncertainties  requiring
management's judgment as to the possible impact to individual  borrowers.  Thus,
at year-end  2002,  55% of the allowance  (compared to 48% at year-end 2001) was
allocated to criticized loans, including $10 million of allowance identified for
a $21 million  commercial  manufacturing  credit for which management had doubts
concerning  the  future  collectibility  of  the  loan  given  current  economic
conditions.  While the payments for this credit were  current  during 2002,  the
credit was added to  nonaccrual  loans during second  quarter 2002.  The primary
shift in the  allowance  allocation  was the  amount  allocated  to  commercial,
financial,  and  agricultural  loans at year-end  2002 which was $65.0  million,
representing  40%  (compared to 34% at year-end  2001) of the allowance for loan
losses.  A greater  amount of these  loans were in  criticized categories  (22%
versus 18% at year-end  2001);  charge offs of this loan type have increased (to
$15.0 million for 2002, up 33%) between the years;  these loans  represented 48%
of  nonperforming  loans  (compared  to  26%  last  year-end);  and  commercial,
financial,  and  agricultural  loans  grew to  represent  22% of total  loans at
December 31, 2002 (compared to 20% at year-end 2001). The allowance allocated to
commercial real estate was 35% at year-end 2002, down from 37% at year-end 2001.
In 2001 for this  category,  a greater  amount of these loans were in criticized
loan categories,  which  materialized  into greater charge offs during 2002 (see
Table 10).  While  commercial  real estate loans grew 18.9% since year-end 2001,
they represented 30% of total loans at December 31, 2002,  relatively  unchanged
from 29% last year.

Management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at December 31,
2003.

Consolidated  net income  could be  affected  if  management's  estimate  of the
allowance  for loan  losses  is  subsequently  materially  different,  requiring
additional  or  less  provision  for  loan  losses  to be  recorded.  Management
carefully considers numerous detailed and general factors, its assumptions,  and
the  likelihood  of  materially   different  conditions  that  could  alter  its
assumptions.  While management uses currently available information to recognize
losses on loans,  future  adjustments  to the  allowance  for loan losses may be
necessary based on changes in economic  conditions and the impact of such change
on the  Corporation's  borrowers.  As an  integral  part  of  their  examination
process,  various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses.
Such  agencies may require that certain loan  balances be charged off when their
credit  evaluations  differ from those of management,  based on their  judgments
about information available to them at the time of their examination.

Nonperforming Loans, Potential Problem Loans, and Other Real Estate Owned

Management   is  committed  to  an  aggressive   nonaccrual   and  problem  loan
identification  philosophy.  This philosophy is implemented  through the ongoing
monitoring  and review of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that
problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized.

Nonperforming  loans are  considered  one  indicator  of  potential  future loan
losses.  Nonperforming  loans are defined as nonaccrual loans,  loans 90 days or
more  past due but still  accruing,  and  restructured  loans.  The  Corporation
specifically  excludes from its definition of  nonperforming  loans student loan
balances  that are 90 days or more  past due and  still  accruing  and that have
contractual  government  guarantees  as to collection of principal and interest.
The  Corporation had  approximately  $13.0 million and $20.2 million at December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of nonperforming student loans.

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when  contractually  past due 90
days  or more as to  interest  or  principal  payments.  Additionally,  whenever
management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the
collectibility of principal or interest on loans, it is

                                       32
<PAGE>

management's  practice  to place such loans on  nonaccrual  status  immediately,
rather  than  delaying  such  action  until the  loans  become 90 days past due.
Previously  accrued  and  uncollected   interest  on  such  loans  is  reversed,
amortization  of related loan fees is suspended,  and income is recorded only to
the extent  that  interest  payments  are  subsequently  received  in cash and a
determination  has  been  made  that  the  principal  balance  of  the  loan  is
collectible.  If collectibility of the principal is in doubt,  payments received
are applied to loan principal.

Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing  interest are also included in
nonperforming  loans.  Loans  past due 90 days or more but  still  accruing  are
classified  as such  where  the  underlying  loans are both  well  secured  (the
collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued  interest) and are
in  the  process  of  collection.  Also  included  in  nonperforming  loans  are
"restructured" loans. Restructured loans involve the granting of some concession
to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan, such as changes
in payment schedule or interest rate.

Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2003, were $121.5 million, compared to $99.3
million at December 31, 2002,  and $52.1 million at December 31, 2001. The ratio
of nonperforming  loans to total loans at the end of 2003 was 1.18%, as compared
to 0.96% and 0.58% at  December  31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  Of the $22.2
million  increase  in  nonperforming  loans  between  year-end  2002  and  2003,
nonaccrual  loans increased $19.8 million and accruing loans past due 90 days or
more increased $3.6 million, while restructured loans decreased $1.2 million. Of
the $47.2 million  increase in  nonperforming  loans  between  year-end 2001 and
2002,  nonaccrual  loans increased $45.9 million,  restructured  loans increased
$1.0  million,  and  accruing  loans  past  due 90 days or more  increased  $0.3
million. The Corporation's  allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was
146% at  year-end  2003,  down from 164% at  year-end  2002 and 246% at year-end
2001.

The upward  trend in  nonperforming  loans was  primarily  due to  increases  in
commercial  nonperforming  loans,  and mostly due to specific larger  commercial
credits. Commercial nonaccrual loans were $95.8 million at December 31, 2003 (up
$22.8 million from year-end 2002),  and  represented  84%, 78%, and 67% of total
nonaccrual loans at year-end 2003, 2002, and 2001,  respectively.  Additionally,
accruing commercial loans past due 90 days or more were $5.8 million at December
31, 2003, and represented  77%, 27%, and 47% of total accruing loans past due 90
days or more at year-end 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

For  year-end  2003  versus  2002,  the $22.8  million  increase  in  commercial
nonaccrual  loans was  predominantly  attributable  to the addition,  during the
second quarter of 2003, of two large commercial credits (totaling  approximately
$20 million at December 31, 2003,  one in the  construction  industry and

                                       33

one in the hospitality  industry).  The $3.6 million increase from year-end 2002
to  year-end  2003 in  accruing  loans  past due 90 days or more  was  primarily
attributable to one large commercial credit ($2.5 million at December 31, 2003),
while the decrease in restructured  loans was due to one large commercial credit
that was transferred to nonaccrual status and subsequently charged off.

For year-end 2002 versus 2001, the increase in commercial  nonaccrual  loans was
predominantly  attributable to the addition of a previously disclosed commercial
manufacturing  relationship  (totaling  $21 million at year-end  2002) for which
payments were current; however, the Corporation had doubts concerning the future
collectibility  of the loan and set aside $10 million of the  allowance for loan
losses for this  credit.  This credit  remains in the  commercial  portfolio  at
December  31,  2003  ($17  million   outstanding)  with  continued  concerns  of
collectibility  and $10 million of the allowance for loan losses set aside.  The
remaining rise in nonaccrual  loans for 2002 was primarily  attributable  to the
commercial loan portfolio, but not concentrated within any industry.

Other real estate owned decreased to $5.5 million at December 31, 2003, compared
to $11.4 million and $2.7 million at year-end 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  The
change in other real estate  owned was  predominantly  due to the  addition  and
subsequent sale of commercial real estate  properties.  An $8.0 million property
was added during 2002, while three other commercial properties (at $1.1 million,
$1.5  million,  and $2.7  million)  were added  during  2003.  The $1.5  million
property  was sold  during  the  second  quarter  of 2003 (at a net loss of $0.6
million),  the $8.0 million  property was sold during the third  quarter of 2003
(at a net gain of $1.0 million),  and the $2.7 million  property was sold during
the fourth quarter of 2003 (at a small gain). Also during fourth quarter 2003, a
$0.5  million  write down was recorded in other  noninterest  expense on another
commercial property in other real estate owned. Net gains on sales of other real
estate owned were  $472,000,  $53,000,  and $643,000 for 2003,  2002,  and 2001,
respectively.  Management actively seeks to ensure properties held are monitored
to minimize the Corporation's risk of loss.

The following table shows,  for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual  basis
and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated, the gross interest that
would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance  with their
original  terms and the amount of interest  income that was included in interest
income for the period.

Potential  problem loans are certain  loans bearing risk ratings by  management
that are not in  nonperforming  status  but where  there  are  doubts as to the
ability of the borrower to comply with present  repayment terms. The decision of
management  to include  performing  loans in  potential  problem  loans does not
necessarily  mean  that  the  Corporation  expects  losses  to  occur  but that
management  recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans.  The
level of potential  problem loans is another  predominant  factor in determining
the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in the determination of the
level of the  allowance  for loan losses.  The loans that have been  reported as
potential  problem  loans are not  concentrated  in a particular  industry  but
rather cover a diverse  range of  businesses.  At December  31, 2003,  potential
problem  loans  totaled $245  million,  compared to $212 million at December 31,
2002.  The $33 million  increase from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003, is
primarily  attributable  to  deterioration  in certain  loans in the  commercial
manufacturing   sector   (accountable  for  approximately  $28  million  of  the
increase).

Investment Securities Portfolio

The investment  securities portfolio is intended to provide the Corporation with
adequate  liquidity,  flexibility  in  asset/liability  management,  a source of
stable  income,   and  is  structured   with  minimum  credit  exposure  to  the
Corporation.  Investment securities classified as available for sale are carried
at fair market value in the  consolidated  balance sheet.  At December 31, 2003,
the total  carrying  value of  investment  securities  represented  25% of total
assets,  compared to 22% at year-end 2002. On average,  the investment portfolio
represented   24%  and  25%  of  average  earning  assets  for  2003  and  2002,
respectively.

The  classification  of  securities as held to maturity or available for sale is
determined  at the  time  of  purchase.  The  Corporation  generally  classifies
investment  purchases as available for sale,  consistent with the  Corporation's
investment  philosophy  of  maintaining  flexibility  to manage  the  investment
portfolio,  particularly  in light  of  asset/liability  management  strategies,
possible securities sales in response to changes in interest rates or prepayment
risk, the need to manage liquidity or regulatory capital, and other factors.

At  December  31,  2003 and 2002,  mortgage-related  securities  (which  include
predominantly    mortgage-backed    securities   and   collateralized   mortgage
obligations)  represented  59.2% and 50.7%,  respectively,  of total  investment
securities  based  on  carrying  value.  The  fair  value  of   mortgage-related
securities  are subject to inherent  risks based upon the future  performance of
the underlying collateral (i.e.,  mortgage loans) for these securities,  such as
prepayment risk and interest rate changes.

At December 31, 2003,  the  Corporation's  securities  portfolio did not contain
securities  of any single  issuer that were payable from and secured by the same
source of revenue or taxing authority where the aggregate carrying value of such
securities  exceeded 10% of stockholders'  equity or approximately  $135 million
(stockholders' equity was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2003).

During 2002, a CMO (included in  mortgage-related  securities) was determined to
have an  other-than-temporary  impairment  that  resulted in a write down on the
security  of $0.8  million  during  2002 and $0.3  million  during 2003 based on
continued  evaluation.  See Note 3,  "Investment  Securities,"  of the  notes to
consolidated financial statements for more information.

Deposits

Deposits  are the  Corporation's  largest  source  of  funds.  See also  section
"Liquidity." The Corporation competes with other bank and nonbank  institutions,
as well as with  investment  alternatives  such as money  market or other mutual
funds and brokerage houses for deposits.  The Corporation's  nonbrokered deposit
growth  was  impacted  by  competitive  factors,  as  well as  other  investment
opportunities available to customers. During both 2003 and 2002, the Corporation
has actively  marketed  its  transaction  accounts  (business  demand  deposits,
interest-bearing  demand  deposits,  and money  market  accounts),  which  offer
competitive,    market-indexed   rates   and   greater   customer   flexibility.
Additionally,  customer  preference to keep funds more liquid in this  prolonged
low rate environment has aided general deposit growth.

At December 31, 2003,  deposits were $9.8 billion,  up $668 million or 7.3% over
December 31, 2002. The sale of two branches during 2003 reduced  deposits by $17
million.  Selected  period-end  deposit  information  is  detailed  in  Note  7,
"Deposits,"  of the notes to  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  a
maturity  distribution  of all time  deposits at December  31,  2003. A maturity
distribution  of certificates of deposit and other time deposits of $100,000 or
more at  December  31, 2003, is shown  in Table  17.  Table  16  summarizes  the
distribution of average deposit balances.

The mix of deposits  changed  during 2003 as customers  reacted to prolonged low
and uncertain interest rates as well as unsteady market conditions.  At December
31, 2003,  noninterest-bearing demand deposits were 18% of deposits, compared to
19%  at  year-end  2002.   Interest-bearing   transaction   accounts   (savings,
interest-bearing  demand,  and money  market  deposits)  grew to 49% of deposits
versus 45% at the end of 2002.  Given the lower  interest rate  environment  and
scheduled  maturities,  total  time  deposits  declined  to 33% of  deposits  at
year-end 2003 compared to 36% at year-end 2002.

On average,  deposits  were $9.3 billion for 2003,  up $387 million or 4.3% over
the average for 2002. Average  nonbrokered  deposits for 2003 were $9.1 billion,
up $472 million or 5.5% compared to 2002.

Other Funding Sources

Other funding  sources,  including  short-term  borrowings,  long-term debt, and
company-obligated   mandatorily   redeemable  preferred  securities  ("wholesale
funds"),  were $4.0 billion at December  31,  2003,  down $0.5 billion from $4.5
billion  at  December  31,  2002.  See  also  section  "Liquidity."   Short-term
borrowings  decreased  $461 million,  primarily in Federal  funds  purchased and
securities  sold under  agreements  to  repurchase.  Short-term  borrowings  are
primarily comprised of Federal funds purchased; securities sold under agreements
to  repurchase;  short-term  Federal Home Loan Bank  advances;  notes payable to
banks;  and treasury,  tax, and loan notes.  The Federal Home Loan Bank advances
included in short-term  borrowings  are those with  original  maturities of less
than one year. The treasury,  tax, and loan notes are demand notes  representing
secured  borrowings  from  the  U.S.  Treasury,   collateralized  by  qualifying
securities  and loans.  The funds are placed  with the  subsidiary  banks at the
discretion  of the U.S.  Treasury  and may be called  at any  time.  See Note 8,
"Short-term  Borrowings," of the notes to consolidated  financial statements for
additional  information  on  short-term  borrowings,  and Table 18 for  specific
disclosure required for major short-term borrowing categories. Long-term debt at
December 31, 2003,  was $1.9  billion, down $55 million from  December 31, 2002,
due primarily to the  issuance  of $50  million  of bank  notes, $203  million
of long-term repurchase agreements, and $250 million of long-term Federal Home
Loan Bank advances, net of the repayments of $302 million of long-term Federal
Home Loan Bank advances and $250 million of bank notes. See Note 9, "Long-term
Debt," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional
information on long-term debt. In addition, during 2002 the Corporation issued
$175 million of company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities.
See Note 10, "Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities," of
the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the
preferred securities and details regarding the impact of recent accounting
pronouncements requiring the deconsolidation of the preferred securities.

Wholesale  funds on average were $4.2 billion for 2003,  up $251 million or 6.3%
over 2002. The mix of wholesale  funding  continued to shift toward  longer-term
instruments,  with average  long-term  funding  representing  49.5% of wholesale
funds  compared  to  42.0% in  2002,  in  response  to  certain  asset/liability
objectives and low interest rates. Within the short-term  borrowing  categories,
average  Federal  funds  purchased  and  securities  sold  under  agreements  to
repurchase were down $237 million, while other short-term borrowing sources were
up $65 million.

Liquidity

The objective of liquidity  management is to ensure that the Corporation has the
ability  to  generate  sufficient  cash  or cash  equivalents  in a  timely  and
cost-effective  manner  to meet its  commitments  as they  fall  due.  Funds are
available  from a number of sources,  primarily  from the core  deposit base and
from loans and securities repayments and maturities.  Additionally, liquidity is
provided  from sales of the  securities  portfolio,  lines of credit  with major
banks,  the ability to acquire large and brokered  deposits,  and the ability to
securitize or package loans for sale.

The Corporation's liquidity management framework includes measurement of several
key elements,  such as wholesale funding as a percent of total assets and liquid
assets to short-term  wholesale funding.  The Corporation's  liquidity framework
also  incorporates  contingency  planning to assess the nature and volatility of
funding sources and to determine  alternatives to these sources. The contingency
plan would be activated to ensure the Corporation's funding commitments could be
met in the event of general market disruption or adverse economic conditions.

Strong  capital  ratios,  credit  quality,  and core  earnings are  essential to
retaining high credit ratings and,  consequently,  cost-effective  access to the
wholesale  funding markets.  A downgrade or loss in credit ratings could have an
impact on the  Corporation's  ability to access  wholesale  funding at favorable
interest rates. As a result,  capital ratios,  asset quality  measurements,  and
profitability  ratios are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the liquidity
management process.

While core deposits and loan and investment  repayment are principal  sources of
liquidity,   funding   diversification  is  another  key  element  of  liquidity
management. Diversity is achieved by strategically

                                       38
<PAGE>

varying depositor type, term,  funding market,  and instrument.  As noted above,
the Parent Company and certain  subsidiary banks are rated by Moody's,  Standard
and Poor's (S&P), and Fitch. These ratings,  along with the Corporation's  other
ratings,   provide   opportunity  for  greater  funding   capacity  and  funding
alternatives.

The Parent Company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds necessary
to  pay  dividends  to  shareholders,  service  debt,  invest  in  subsidiaries,
repurchase  common stock, and satisfy other operating  requirements.  The Parent
Company's  primary  funding  sources  to meet  its  liquidity  requirements  are
dividends  and service  fees from  subsidiaries,  borrowings  with major  banks,
commercial paper issuance,  and proceeds from the issuance of equity.  Dividends
received in cash from subsidiaries  totaled $179.5 million in 2003 and represent
a primary  funding  source.  At December 31, 2003,  $136.8  million in dividends
could  be  paid  to the  parent  by its  subsidiaries  without  obtaining  prior
regulatory approval,  subject to the capital needs of the banks. As discussed in
Item 1, the subsidiary  banks are subject to regulation and, among other things,
may be limited in their ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the Parent
Company.  Accordingly,  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated
statements of cash flows may not represent  cash  immediately  available for the
payment of cash dividends to the shareholders or for other cash needs.

In addition to dividends and service fees from subsidiaries,  the Parent Company
has  multiple  funding  sources  that could be used to  increase  liquidity  and
provide  additional  financial  flexibility.  These sources  include a revolving
credit facility, commercial paper, and two shelf registrations to issue debt and
preferred  securities or a combination thereof. The Parent Company has available
a $100 million  revolving credit facility with established  lines of credit from
nonaffiliated  banks,  of which $100 million was available at December 31, 2003.
In addition,  $200  million of  commercial  paper was  available at December 31,
2003, under the Parent Company's $200 million commercial paper program.

In May 2002, the Parent  Company filed a "shelf"  registration  statement  under
which  the  Parent  Company  may  offer up to $300  million  of trust  preferred
securities.  In May 2002 $175 million of trust preferred securities were issued,
bearing a 7.625%  fixed coupon  rate.  At December  31,  2003,  $125 million was
available under the trust preferred shelf. In May 2001, the Parent Company filed
a "shelf" registration statement whereby the Parent Company may offer up to $500
million of any combination of the following securities,  either separately or in
units: debt securities,  preferred stock,  depositary shares,  common stock, and
warrants.  In  August  2001,  the  Parent  Company  issued  $200  million  in  a
subordinated  note  offering,  bearing a 6.75%  fixed  coupon  rate and  10-year
maturity.  At December 31,  2003,  $300  million was  available  under the shelf
registration.

Investment  securities  are an  important  tool to the  Corporation's  liquidity
objective.  As of December 31, 2003,  all securities are classified as available
for sale and are reported at fair value on the  consolidated  balance sheet.  Of
the $3.8  billion  investment  portfolio,  $1.6  billion  were pledged to secure
certain  deposits,  Federal Home Loan Bank  advances,  or for other  purposes as
required or permitted by law. The remaining  securities could be pledged or sold
to enhance liquidity, if necessary.

The bank  subsidiaries  have a variety of funding  sources  (in  addition to key
liquidity  sources,  such  as  core  deposits,  loan  and  investment  portfolio
repayments and maturities, and loan and investment portfolio sales) available to
increase financial  flexibility.  A $2 billion bank note program associated with
Associated Bank, National  Association,  was established during 2000. Under this
program,  short-term and long-term debt may be issued.  As of December 31, 2003,
$300 million of long-term  bank notes and $200 million of short-term  bank notes
were  outstanding.  At December 31, 2003,  $1.5 billion was available under this
program.  The banks have also  established  federal funds lines with major banks
totaling  approximately  $3.6 billion and the ability to borrow from the Federal
Home Loan Bank ($0.9 billion was outstanding at December 31, 2003). In addition,
the bank  subsidiaries  also accept  Eurodollar  deposits,  issue  institutional
certificates  of deposit,  and from time to time offer brokered  certificates of
deposit.

As reflected in Table 22, the  Corporation  has various  financial  obligations,
including  contractual  obligations  and other  commitments,  which may  require
future cash payments.  The relatively shorter

                                       39
<PAGE>

maturities  in time  deposits is not out of the  ordinary  to the  Corporation's
experience of its customer  base  preference.  While the time deposits  indicate
shorter   maturities  and  a  declining   trend  (largely  due  to  the  reduced
attractiveness  of  time  deposits  in  the  prolonged  low  rate  environment),
liquidity  was  supported  by strong  growth  in  non-time  deposits.  Continued
strategic  emphasis on deposit  growth  should  further  support this  liquidity
source.  The  Corporation  has been  purposely  extending its long-term  funding
sources  primarily to take  advantage of  extending  maturities  in the low rate
environment.  While this commits the  Corporation  contractually  to future cash
payments,  it is  supportive  of  interest  rate risk and  liquidity  management
strategies.  As a financial services provider,  the Corporation routinely enters
into  commitments  to extend credit.  While  contractual  obligations  represent
future  cash  requirements  of  the  Corporation,   a  significant   portion  of
commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon.

For the year ended  December 31, 2003,  net cash  provided  from  operating  and
financing  activities was $496.8 million and $9.1 million,  respectively,  while
investing activities used net cash of $551.0 million, for a net decrease in cash
and cash  equivalents of $45.1 million since year-end  2002.  Generally,  during
2003, deposit growth was strong,  while net asset growth since year-end 2002 was
moderate (up 1.4%).  Thus,  the reliance on other  funding  sources was reduced,
particularly  short-term  borrowings  and  long-term  debt.  The deposit  growth
provided for the repayment of short-term  borrowings and long-term debt,  common
stock  repurchases,  and the  payment  of cash  dividends  to the  Corporation's
shareholders.

For the year ended  December 31, 2002,  net cash  provided  from  operating  and
financing activities was $298.6 million and $75.8 million,  respectively,  while
investing activities used net cash of $534.8 million, for a net decrease in cash
and cash  equivalents of $160.4 million since year-end 2001.  Generally,  during
2002,  anticipated  maturities  of time  deposits  occurred and net asset growth
since year-end 2001 was up due to the Signal acquisition.  Other funding sources
were utilized,  particularly  long-term debt, to finance the Signal acquisition,
replenish the net decrease in deposits, repay short-term borrowings, provide for
common stock repurchases, and pay cash dividends to the Corporation's
shareholders.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest  rates,  exchange rates,
commodity prices,  and other relevant market rate or price risk. The Corporation
faces market risk in the form of interest  rate risk through  other than trading
activities.  Market  risk from  other  than  trading  activities  in the form of
interest  rate risk is  measured  and managed  through a number of methods.  The
Corporation uses financial  modeling  techniques that measure the sensitivity of
future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk.
Policies established by the Corporation's Asset/Liability Committee and approved
by the Board of Directors limit exposure of earnings at risk.  General  interest
rate movements are used to develop  sensitivity as the Corporation  feels it has
no primary  exposure to a specific  point on the yield  curve.  These limits are
based  on  the  Corporation's  exposure  to a 100 bp and  200 bp  immediate  and
sustained parallel rate move, either upward or downward.

Interest Rate Risk

In order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates, the Corporation uses
three different measurement tools: static gap analysis,  simulation of earnings,
and economic value of equity.  The static gap analysis  starts with  contractual
repricing   information  for  assets,   liabilities,   and   off-balance   sheet
instruments.  These  items are then  combined  with  repricing  estimations  for
administered rate (interest-bearing  demand deposits,  savings, and money market
accounts) and non-rate related products (demand deposit accounts,  other assets,
and other liabilities) to create a baseline repricing balance sheet. In addition
to the  contractual  information,  residential  mortgage whole loan products and
mortgage-backed   securities  are  adjusted  based  on  industry   estimates  of
prepayment  speeds that capture the expected  prepayment of principal  above the
contractual  amount based on how far away the contractual  coupon is from market
coupon rates.

(1)  The interest rate sensitivity assumptions for demand deposits, savings
     accounts, money market accounts, and interest-bearing demand deposit
     accounts are based on current and historical experiences regarding
     portfolio retention and interest rate repricing behavior. Based on these
     experiences, a portion of these balances are considered to be long-term and
     fairly stable and are, therefore, included in the "Over 1 Year" category.
(2)  For analysis purposes, Brokered CDs of $165 million have been included with
     other interest-bearing liabilities and excluded from interest-bearing
     deposits.
(3)  Interest rate swaps on funding are presented on a net basis.
</TABLE>

The  static  gap  analysis  in  Table  20  provides  a  representation   of  the
Corporation's  earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It is a static
indicator that does not reflect various  repricing  characteristics  and may not
necessarily  indicate  the  sensitivity  of net  interest  income in a  changing
interest rate environment.

At the end of 2002,  the  Corporation's  balance  sheet was asset  sensitive  to
interest rate movements.  (Asset sensitive means that assets will reprice faster
than  liabilities.  In a rising rate  environment,  an asset sensitive bank will
generally  benefit.) During 2003, the Corporation  remained asset sensitive as a
result of issuing long-term funding,  growth in demand deposits,  and shortening
of the mortgage  portfolio and  investment  portfolio  due to faster  prepayment
experience.

Interest  rate  risk of  embedded  positions  (including  prepayment  and  early
withdrawal  options,  lagged interest rate changes,  administered  interest rate
products,  and cap and floor  options  within  products)  require a more dynamic
measuring tool to capture earnings risk.  Earnings simulation and economic value
of equity are used to more completely assess interest rate risk.

Along with the static gap analysis,  determining  the  sensitivity of short-term
future earnings to a hypothetical  plus or minus 100 bp and 200 bp parallel rate
shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling. In addition to
the assumptions used to create the static gap,  simulation of earnings  includes
the  modeling  of the  balance  sheet  as an  ongoing  entity.  Future  business
assumptions  involving  administered  rate  products,   prepayments  for  future
rate-sensitive balances, and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities
are included.  These items are then modeled to project net interest income based
on a hypothetical  change in interest  rates.  The resulting net interest income

                                       41
<PAGE>

for the next  12-month  period is compared  to the net  interest  income  amount
calculated  using flat  rates.  This  difference  represents  the  Corporation's
earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus 100 bp parallel rate shock.

The resulting  simulations  for December 31, 2003,  projected  that net interest
income would increase by  approximately  1.7% of budgeted net interest income if
rates rose by a 100 bp shock,  and projected that the net interest  income would
decrease by approximately  1.1% if rates fell by a 100 bp shock. At December 31,
2002, the 100 bp shock up was projected to increase budgeted net interest income
by  approximately  3.9%,  and the 100 bp shock down was  projected  to  decrease
budgeted net interest income by approximately 4.0%.

Economic  value of equity is another tool used to measure the impact of interest
rates  on the  present  value  of  assets,  liabilities  and  off-balance  sheet
financial  instruments.  This measurement is a longer-term  analysis of interest
rate risk as it evaluates every cash flow produced by the current balance sheet.
The projected  changes for earnings  simulation and economic value of equity for
both 2003 and 2002 were within the Corporation's interest rate risk policy.

These results are based solely on immediate and  sustained  parallel  changes in
market  rates and do not reflect the  earnings  sensitivity  that may arise from
other  factors.  These  factors  may  include  changes in the shape of the yield
curve, the change in spread between key market rates, or accounting  recognition
of the impairment of certain intangibles.  The above results are also considered
to be  conservative  estimates  due to the fact  that no  management  action  to
mitigate potential income variances are included within the simulation  process.
This action could include,  but would not be limited to, delaying an increase in
deposit rates,  extending  liabilities,  using financial  derivative products to
hedge  interest rate risk,  changing the pricing  characteristics  of loans,  or
changing the growth rate of certain assets and liabilities.

The  Corporation  uses  interest rate  derivative  financial  instruments  as an
asset/liability  management  tool to hedge  mismatches in interest rate exposure
indicated by the net interest income  simulation  described above. They are used
to modify the Corporation's  exposures to interest rate fluctuations and provide
more stable spreads between loan yields and the rate on their funding sources.

In 2003,  the  Corporation  entered into $96 million in notional  amounts of new
interest rate swaps to reduce  interest  rate risk.  Interest rate swaps involve
the exchange of fixed- and  variable-rate  payments  without the exchange of the
underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated.

                           ====================================================

To hedge against rising  interest  rates,  the Corporation may use interest rate
caps.  Counterparties to these interest cap agreements pay the Corporation based
on the  notional  amount and the  difference  between  current  rates and strike
rates.  At December  31,  2003,  there were $200  million of interest  rate caps
outstanding,  which have a six month  LIBOR  strike of 4.72%.  To hedge  against
falling interest rates, the Corporation may use interest rate floors. Like caps,
counterparties  to interest rate floor  agreements pay the Corporation  based on
the notional  amount and the difference  between current rates and strike rates.
There were no floors  outstanding  at December  31, 2003.  Derivative  financial
instruments are also discussed in Note 15, "Derivative and Hedging  Activities,"
of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Off-Balance Sheet Risk,
  and Contingent Liabilities

Through the normal  course of  operations,  the  Corporation  has  entered  into
certain  contractual   obligations  and  other  commitments.   Such  obligations
generally relate to funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances, as
well as leases for premises and equipment. As a financial services provider, the
Corporation   routinely  enters  into   commitments  to  extend  credit.   While
contractual obligations represent future cash requirements of the Corporation, a
significant  portion of  commitments  to extend credit may expire  without being
drawn  upon.  Such  commitments  are  subject to the same  credit  policies  and
approval process accorded to loans made by the Corporation.

The following table  summarizes  significant  contractual  obligations and other
commitments at December 31, 2003. The payment  amounts  represent  those amounts
contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamoritized  premiums
or  discounts,  hedge  basis  adjustments,   or  other  similar  carrying  value
adjustments.  Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in
the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements.

The Corporation also has obligations  under its retirement plans as described in
Note 12, "Retirement Plans," of the notes to consolidated  financial statements.
The  Corporation  does not expect to make a  contribution  to its  pension  plan
during 2004 due to the funded status of the plan.

The  Corporation   also  enters  into  derivative   contracts  under  which  the
Corporation   is  required  to  either   receive   cash  from  or  pay  cash  to
counterparties  depending on changes in interest rates. Derivative contracts are
carried  at fair  value on the  consolidated  balance  sheet with the fair value
representing  the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments
based on market  interest  rates as of the balance sheet date. The fair value of
the  contracts  change  daily as  market  interest  rates  change.  Because  the
derivative  liabilities  recorded on the balance  sheet at December 31, 2003, do
not  represent the amounts that may  ultimately  be paid under these  contracts,
these  liabilities  are not  included  in the table of  contractual  obligations
presented  above.  Further  discussion of derivative  instruments is included in
Note 1, "Summary of Significant  Accounting  Policies," and Note 15, "Derivative
and Hedging Activities," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

contingent  upon the occurrence of certain  events.  A discussion of significant
contractual  arrangements  under which the Corporation may be held  contingently

Capital

Stockholders'  equity at  December  31,  2003,  increased  $76  million  to $1.3
billion,  or $18.39 per share compared with $17.13 per share at the end of 2002.
Stockholders'  equity is also described in Note 11,  "Stockholders'  Equity," of
the notes to consolidated financial statements.

The  increase in  stockholders'  equity for 2003 was  primarily  composed of the
retention  of  earnings  and the  exercise  of stock  options,  with  offsetting
decreases to  stockholders'  equity from the payment of cash  dividends  and the
repurchase of common stock. Additionally,  stockholders' equity at year-end 2003
included $52.1 million of accumulated  other  comprehensive  income versus $60.3
million at December 31, 2002.  The decrease in accumulated  other  comprehensive
income was predominantly related to a decrease in unrealized gains on securities
available  for  sale  (due   primarily  to  declines  in  the  market  value  of
mortgage-related securities), lower unrealized losses on cash flow hedges, and a
change in the additional pension obligation (See Note 12, "Retirement Plans," of
the notes to consolidated financial statements),  net of the related tax effect.
Stockholders' equity to assets at December 31, 2003 was 8.84%, compared to 8.46%
at the end of 2002.

The adequacy of the Corporation's  capital is regularly  reviewed to ensure that
sufficient  capital  is  available  for  current  and  future  needs  and  is in
compliance  with  regulatory  guidelines.  The  assessment  of  overall  capital
adequacy  depends on a variety of factors,  including asset quality,  liquidity,
stability  of  earnings,  changing  competitive  forces,  economic  condition in
markets served, and strength of management.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the  Corporation's  Tier 1 risk-based  capital
ratios, total risk-based capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) ratios, and Tier 1 leverage
ratios were in excess of regulatory  minimum and

                                       44
<PAGE>

well capitalized  requirements.  It is management's intent to exceed the minimum
requisite  capital levels.  Capital ratios are included in Note 18,  "Regulatory
Matters," of the notes to  consolidated  financial  statements.  As discussed in
Note 10,  "Company-Obligated  Mandatorily  Redeemable Preferred Securities," and
Note  18,  "Regulatory   Matters,"  of  the  notes  to  consolidated   financial
statements,  the  preferred  securities  qualify  as  Tier  1  Capital  for  the
Corporation  under  Federal  Reserve  Board  guidelines.  As a result  of recent
accounting  pronouncements,  the Federal  Reserve Board is currently  evaluating
whether  deconsolidation  of the trust  will  affect  the  qualification  of the
preferred  securities as Tier 1 capital.  If it is determined that the preferred
securities no longer  qualify as Tier 1 capital,  the effect of such a change is
not expected to affect the Corporation's well-capitalized status.

The Board of Directors has  authorized  management  to repurchase  shares of the
Corporation's  common stock each quarter in the market, to be made available for
issuance in connection with the Corporation's  employee  incentive plans and for
other corporate  purposes.  For the Corporation's  employee incentive plans, the
Board  of  Directors  authorized  the  repurchase  of up to 1.6  million  shares
(400,000  shares  per  quarter)  in 2003  and  2002.  Of  these  authorizations,
approximately  1.3 million shares were repurchased for $43.3 million during 2002
(with approximately 1.0 million shares reissued in connection with stock options
exercised),  while none were  repurchased  during 2003 (with  approximately  1.1
million   shares   reissued  in  connection   with  stock  options   exercised).
Additionally,  under two  separate  actions in 2000 and one action in 2003,  the
Board  of  Directors   authorized  the  repurchase  and   cancellation   of  the
Corporation's  outstanding  shares,  not to exceed  approximately  11.0  million
shares on a  combined  basis.  Under  these  authorizations,  approximately  2.1
million shares were repurchased for $74.5 million during 2003 at an average cost
of $36.17 per share,  while during 2002  approximately  1.3 million  shares were
repurchased  for $44.0  million  at an  average  cost of $32.69  per  share.  At
December  31,  2003,  approximately  3.7 million  shares  remain  authorized  to
repurchase.  The  repurchase  of shares  will be based on market  opportunities,
capital levels, growth prospects, and other investment opportunities.

Shares repurchased and not retired are held as treasury stock and,  accordingly,
are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders' equity.

Management  believes  that a  strong  capital  position  is  necessary  to  take
advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion,  and
to provide  depositor  and  investor  confidence.  Management  actively  reviews
capital  strategies for the Corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of
perceived business risks, future growth opportunities,  industry standards,  and
regulatory  requirements.  It is  management's  intent to  maintain  an  optimal
capital and leverage mix for growth and for shareholder return.

Fourth Quarter 2003 Results

Net income for fourth quarter 2003 was $55.6  million,  $2.2 million higher than
the $53.4  million  earned in the  fourth  quarter  of 2002.  Basic and  diluted
earnings per share for fourth  quarter 2003 were $0.76 and $0.75,  respectively,
compared to $0.72 and $0.71, respectively, for fourth quarter 2002.

Taxable  equivalent  net  interest  income  for fourth  quarter  2003 was $133.4
million,  $2.3 million lower than fourth  quarter 2002.  Volume  variances  were
unfavorable by $0.6 million  (primarily  from lower average  loans),  while rate
variances were  unfavorable by $1.7 million  (primarily  from  unfavorable  rate
variance  on  earning   assets   greater  than   favorable   rate   variance  on
interest-bearing  liabilities).  Average  earning  assets  declined  $41 million
(0.3%) to $13.8 billion,  the net of a $204 million decline in average loans and
a $163 million  increase in average  investments.  Interest-bearing  liabilities
decreased  $155  million,  the  result  of a  $646  million  growth  in  average
interest-bearing  deposits  (predominantly  growth  in  interest-bearing  demand
deposits),  offset by an $801  million  decline  in  average  wholesale  funding
(particularly short-term borrowings given deposit growth). The average Fed funds
rate for fourth  quarter 2003 of 1.00% was 45 bp lower than fourth quarter 2002.
For fourth quarter 2003,  net interest  margin was 3.81%, 6 bp lower than fourth
quarter 2002, the result of a 6 bp lower contribution from net free funds (which
contributed less due to lower rates, despite increased  balances).  The yield

                                       45
<PAGE>

on earning  assets for fourth  quarter 2003 was 5.22% or 55 bp lower than fourth
quarter  2002,  primarily  attributable  to  lower  loan  yields.  The  rate  on
interest-bearing liabilities also decreased 55 bp to 1.68%, also due principally
to the repricing of deposit  products and wholesale  funds in the lower interest
rate environment.

The  provision  for loan losses of $9.6 million in fourth  quarter 2003 was $5.0
million lower than fourth quarter 2002.  Less provision was provided in light of
flat loan growth as well asset quality  differences  between the  quarters.  The
allowance  for loan losses to loans was 1.73% at December 31, 2003,  compared to
1.58% at December 31, 2002 (see sections,  "Loans," "Allowance for Loan Losses,"
and  "Nonperforming  Loans,  Potential  Problem  Loans,  and Other  Real  Estate
Owned.")

Noninterest  income in fourth  quarter  2003 was $10.2  million  lower  than the
comparable  quarter in 2002,  driven by a $16.7  million  decrease  in  mortgage
banking  income  and a  $3.9  increase  in  retail  commissions.  Although  2003
secondary mortgage production was up $1.1 billion from 2002, production declined
significantly in fourth quarter 2003,  especially  reflecting lower  refinancing
activity  due to the upward  movement  in  mortgage  rates.  Secondary  mortgage
production was $0.5 billion in fourth quarter 2003 versus $1.2 billion in fourth
quarter 2002, resulting in decreased gains on sales (down $13.2 million). Retail
commissions  were up $3.9 million,  with increases in insurance  commissions (up
$3.4 million,  attributable to the CFG acquisition)  and brokerage  commissions,
including  variable  annuities (up $0.5  million).  Trust service fees increased
$2.1  million,  reflecting  new  business,  increases  in the fee  structure  on
personal trust accounts, and improved equity markets. A $1.7 million increase in
asset sales gains was a result of a $1.4  million  gain in fourth  quarter  2003
(with $1.3 million gain from two branch  sales)  compared to a $0.4 million loss
in fourth  quarter 2002.  Credit card and other  nondeposit  fees were down $1.6
million,  due to lower merchant fees related to the merchant  processing sale in
March 2003.

Noninterest  expense  between the  comparable  quarters  was down $6.9  million.
Mortgage  servicing  rights  expense  decreased by $9.6  million,  due to a $3.5
million  recovery of mortgage  servicing  rights  valuation  allowance in fourth
quarter 2003 versus a $6.7 million  addition in fourth  quarter 2002, a function
of the  significant  change  in  prepayment  speeds in the  servicing  portfolio
between the fourth quarter periods.  Loan expenses were down $2.8 million,  with
credit card loan expenses down $1.9 million (due to the merchant processing sale
in March 2003) and mortgage loan  expenses down $0.9 million  (impacted by lower
secondary  mortgage  production  between  the  comparable  quarters).  Personnel
expense was $4.3 million higher, with  salary-related  expenses up $4.4 million,
attributable to the expanded  employee base from CFG and merit increases between
the years.  Income tax expense was down $2.9 million between the fourth quarters
due to a decrease in the effective tax rate from 26.73% for fourth  quarter 2003
compared  to  30.3%  for  fourth  quarter  2002,  resulting  from  a  beneficial
structural change within the Corporation's  retirement plans, adjustments to the
valuation allowance, and state apportionment factors.

2002 Compared to 2001

The  Corporation  recorded  net  income of  $210.7  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2002, an increase of $31.2 million or 17.4% over the $179.5 million
earned in 2001.  Basic  earnings per share for 2002 were $2.82, a 14.2% increase
over 2001 basic  earnings per share of $2.47.  Earnings  per diluted  share were
$2.79, a 13.9% increase over 2001 diluted earnings per share of $2.45. Return on
average  assets  and return on  average  equity for 2002 were 1.47% and  17.10%,
respectively,  compared  to 1.37%  and  17.31%,  respectively,  for  2001.  Cash
dividends  of $1.21 per share  paid in 2002  increased  by 9.3% over  2001.  Key
factors behind these results are discussed below.

Taxable  equivalent  net  interest  income was $525.3  million  for 2002,  $81.1
million or 18.3% higher than 2001.  Although taxable equivalent  interest income
decreased  $86.7 million,  interest  expense  decreased by $167.8  million.  The
increase  in  taxable  equivalent  net  interest  income  was due to  changes in
interest rates (adding $45.8 million) and increased volume of earning assets and
liabilities,  together  with  changes in product  mix  (adding  $35.3  million).
Average  earning assets  increased $1.0 billion to $13.3 billion,  including the
impact of the acquisition of Signal on February 28, 2002 (see section  "Business
Combinations").

Net  interest  income and net interest  margin were  impacted in 2002 by the low
interest rate environment,  competitive pricing pressures,  higher earning asset
balances,  and funding  strategies to

                                       47
<PAGE>

take  advantage  of lower  interest  rates.  While the Federal  Reserve  lowered
interest rates eleven times during 2001, producing an average Federal funds rate
of 3.88% for 2001, interest rates in 2002 remained level at 1.75% until November
when the Federal Reserve reduced the rate by 50 bp, for an average rate of 1.67%
in 2002.

The net interest margin for 2002 was 3.95%, compared to 3.62% in 2001. The 33 bp
increase in net interest  margin is  attributable to the net of a 50 bp increase
in  interest  rate  spread  (the net of a 172 bp lower cost of  interest-bearing
liabilities  offset by a 122 bp decrease in the yield on earning assets),  and a
17 bp lower contribution from net free funds.

Total loans were $10.3 billion at December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.3 billion
or 14.2%  over  December  31,  2001,  attributable  in large  part to the Signal
acquisition,  which added $760 million in loans at consummation date. Commercial
loan balances grew $1.1 billion  (20.4%) and  represented  61% of total loans at
December 31, 2002,  compared to 58% at year-end  2001.  Total deposits were $9.1
billion at December 31, 2002,  including  $785 million  acquired with the Signal
acquisition.  To take advantage of the lower rate  environment,  the Corporation
increased   long-term   debt  by  $803   million  and  issued  $175  million  of
company-obligated  mandatorily  redeemable  preferred  securities.  See Note 10,
"Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities," of the notes to
consolidated  financial  statements for additional  information on the preferred
securities and details regarding the impact of recent accounting  pronouncements
requiring the deconsolidation of the preferred securities.

Asset quality was affected by the impact of challenging  economic  conditions on
customers.  The provision for loan losses increased to $50.7 million compared to
$28.2 million in 2001. Net charge offs were $28.3  million,  an increase of $8.1
million  over 2001,  due  primarily  to the  charge  off of  several  commercial
credits.  Net charge offs were 0.28% of average loans compared to 0.22% in 2001.
The ratio of allowance  for loan losses to loans was 1.58% and 1.42% at December
31,  2002 and  2001,  respectively.  Nonperforming  loans  were  $99.3  million,
representing 0.96% of total loans at year-end 2002, compared to $52.1 million or
0.58% of total loans last year.  See sections,  "Allowance  for Loan Losses" and
"Nonperforming Loans,  Potential Problem Loans, and Other Real Estate Owned" for
more discussion.

Noninterest  income was $215.8  million for 2002,  $23.5 million or 12.2% higher
than 2001, led by strong results in mortgage banking and service charge revenue.
Mortgage  banking  revenue  increased by $16.0 million  (31.6%) driven by strong
secondary  mortgage  production  ($3.2 billion for 2002 compared to $2.3 billion
for  2001),  while  service  charges on deposit  accounts  were up $8.2  million
(21.8%)  over 2001,  due  largely  to higher  volumes  associated  with a larger
account base.

Noninterest expense was $370.1 million, up $35.0 million or 10.4% over 2001, due
principally to the Corporation's larger operating base and increases in mortgage
servicing  rights  expense.  Personnel  expense  rose  $20.3  million  or 12.0%,
reflecting  the  expanded  employee  base,  as well as higher base  salaries and
fringe benefit costs. Mortgage servicing rights expense increased $10.5 million,
a function of increases to both the valuation  allowance and higher amortization
of the mortgage servicing rights asset.

Income tax expense  increased to $85.6 million,  up $14.1 million from 2001. The
increase  was  primarily  attributable  to higher net  income  before  tax.  The
effective tax rate in 2002 was 28.9% compared to 28.5% for 2001.

Subsequent Event

On January 28, 2004, the Board of Directors  declared a $0.34 per share dividend
payable on February 16, 2004, to shareholders of record as of February 2, 2004.

Future Accounting Pronouncements

Note  1,  "Summary  of  Significant   Accounting  Policies,"  of  the  notes  to
consolidated  financial  statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by
the  Corporation  during 2003 and the  expected  impact of  accounting  policies
recently  issued or proposed but not yet  required to be adopted.  To the extent
the adoption of new accounting  standards  materially  affects the Corporation's
financial  condition,  results of  operations,  or  liquidity,  the  impacts are
discussed in the applicable  sections of this financial  review and the notes to
consolidated financial statements.

                              ASSOCIATED BANC-CORP
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The accounting and reporting  policies of the Corporation  conform to accounting
principles  generally  accepted  in the United  States of America and to general
practice within the financial services industry.  The following is a description
of the more significant of those policies.

Business

The Corporation  provides a full range of banking and related financial services
to individual  and corporate  customers  through its network of bank and nonbank
subsidiaries. The Corporation is subject to competition from other financial and
non-financial   institutions  that  offer  similar  or  competing  products  and
services.  The  Corporation  is regulated  by federal and state  agencies and is
subject to periodic examinations by those agencies.

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company
and  subsidiaries,  all of which are wholly owned. All significant  intercompany
balances and  transactions  have been  eliminated in  consolidation.  Results of
operations of companies purchased and accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting  are included from the date of  acquisition.  Certain  amounts in the
2002 and 2001 consolidated  financial statements,  as well as certain amounts in
the previously  issued 2003 earnings press release,  have been  reclassified  to
conform with the 2003 Form 10-K  presentation.  In particular,  for presentation
purposes  and  greater  comparability  with  industry  practice,   certain  loan
origination  costs in the  consolidated  statements of income were  reclassified
against gains on the sales of mortgage  loans for 2003,  2002,  and 2001.  These
reclassifications  resulted in an equal decrease to both noninterest  income and
noninterest  expense of $6.1  million in 2003,  $4.5  million in 2002,  and $3.3
million in 2001. The  reclassifications had no effect on stockholders' equity or
net income as previously reported.

In preparing the consolidated  financial  statements,  management is required to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities  as of the date of the balance  sheet and  revenues and expenses for
the period.  Actual  results could differ  significantly  from those  estimates.
Estimates that are  particularly  susceptible to significant  change include the
determination  of the  allowance  for loan losses,  mortgage  servicing  rights,
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, and income taxes.

Investment Securities

Securities are classified as held to maturity, available for sale, or trading at
the time of purchase. In 2003 and 2002, all securities purchased were classified
as available  for sale.  Investment  securities  classified as held to maturity,
which  management has the positive  intent and ability to hold to maturity,  are
reported at amortized cost,  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion
of discounts,  using a method that approximates  level yield. The amortized cost
of debt  securities  classified  as held to  maturity or  available  for sale is
adjusted for  amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to the earlier
of call date or maturity,  or in the case of mortgage-related  securities,  over
the estimated life of the security.  Such amortization and accretion is included
in interest income from the related security.  Available for sale securities are
reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related deferred
income taxes,  included in stockholders' equity as a separate component of other
comprehensive  income.  The cost of  securities  sold is  based on the  specific
identification   method.   Any   security   for   which   there   has   been  an
other-than-temporary  impairment of value is written down to its estimated  fair
value through a charge to earnings and a new cost basis is established. Realized
securities

                                       55
<PAGE>

gains or losses and  declines  in value  judged to be  other-than-temporary  are
included in  investment  securities  gains  (losses),  net, in the  consolidated
statements of income.

Loans

Loans and leases are carried at the  principal  amount  outstanding,  net of any
unearned  income.  Unearned  income from direct  leases is recognized on a basis
that  generally   approximates  a  level  yield  on  the  outstanding   balances
receivable.  Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred,  and the net  amount is  amortized  over the  contractual  life of the
related loans or over the commitment period as an adjustment of yield.

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when  contractually  past due 90
days  or more as to  interest  or  principal  payments.  Additionally,  whenever
management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the
collectibility of principal or interest on loans, it is management's practice to
place such loans on  nonaccrual  status  immediately,  rather than delaying such
action  until  the  loans  become  90 days  past  due.  Previously  accrued  and
uncollected  interest on such loans is  reversed,  amortization  of related loan
fees is  suspended,  and income is  recorded  only to the extent  that  interest
payments are  subsequently  received in cash and a  determination  has been made
that the principal balance of the loan is collectible.  If collectibility of the
principal  is in doubt,  payments  received  are  applied to loan  principal.  A
nonaccrual  loan is returned  to accrual  status  when the  obligation  has been
brought  current  and  the  ultimate  collectibility  of the  total  contractual
principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market as determined on
an  aggregate  basis and  generally  consist  of current  production  of certain
fixed-rate first mortgage loans. Holding costs are treated as period costs.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is a reserve for estimated  credit losses.  Actual
credit  losses,  net of  recoveries,  are deducted  from the  allowance for loan
losses.  A provision for loan losses,  which is a charge  against  earnings,  is
recorded to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level that, in management's
judgment, is adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio.

The allocation  methodology  applied by the Corporation,  designed to assess the
adequacy of the  allowance  for loan losses,  focuses on changes in the size and
character  of the loan  portfolio,  changes  in  levels  of  impaired  and other
nonperforming  loans,  historical  losses on each portfolio  category,  the risk
inherent in specific  loans,  concentrations  of loans to specific  borrowers or
industries,   existing  economic  conditions,   the  fair  value  of  underlying
collateral,  and other  factors  which could  affect  potential  credit  losses.
Management   maintains  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  using  an  allocation
methodology plus an unallocated  portion,  as determined by economic  conditions
and other  qualitative  and  quantitative  factors  affecting the  Corporation's
borrowers.  Management allocates the allowance for loan losses by pools of risk.
The  commercial  loan  (commercial,  financial,  and  agricultural;  real estate
construction;  commercial real estate; and lease financing)  allocation is based
on a quarterly  review of individual  loans,  loan types,  and  industries.  The
retail loan  (residential  mortgage,  home equity,  and consumer)  allocation is
based on  analysis  of  historical  delinquency  and charge off  statistics  and
trends.  Minimum  loss  factors  used by the  Corporation  for  criticized  loan
categories are consistent with regulatory  agency  classifications  and factors.
Loss  factors  for  non-criticized   loan  categories  are  based  primarily  on
historical loan loss experience.

Management,  considering current information and events regarding the borrowers'
ability to repay their  obligations,  considers a loan to be impaired when it is
probable  that the  Corporation  will be  unable  to  collect  all  amounts  due
according to the contractual  terms of the note agreement,  including  principal
and  interest.  Management  has  determined  that  commercial,   financial,  and
agricultural  loans,

                                       56
<PAGE>

commercial  real estate loans,  and real estate  construction  loans that are on
nonaccrual  status or have had their terms  restructured  meet this  definition.
Large groups of  homogeneous  loans,  such as mortgage and consumer  loans,  are
collectively  evaluated  for  impairment.  The amount of  impairment is measured
based upon the loan's  observable  market price, the estimated fair value of the
collateral for collateral-dependent  loans, or alternatively,  the present value
of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective  interest rate.
Interest  income on impaired loans is recorded when cash is received and only if
principal is considered to be fully collectible.

Management  believes  that the  allowance  for loan  losses is  adequate.  While
management  uses  available  information  to recognize  losses on loans,  future
additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary  based on changes in
economic conditions.  In addition,  various regulatory agencies,  as an integral
part  of  their  examination  process,  periodically  review  the  Corporation's
allowance  for loan  losses.  Such  agencies  may  require  the  Corporation  to
recognize  additions  to the  allowance  for loan  losses or that  certain  loan
balances  be charged  off when their  credit  evaluations  differ  from those of
management based on their judgments about  information  available to them at the
time of their examinations.

Other Real Estate Owned

Other real estate owned is included in other assets in the consolidated  balance
sheets and is comprised of property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or
acceptance  of  a  deed-in-lieu   of  foreclosure,   and  loans   classified  as
in-substance  foreclosure.  Other real estate  owned is recorded at the lower of
recorded investment in the loans at the time of acquisition or the fair value of
the  properties,  less estimated  selling costs.  Any write-down in the carrying
value of a property at the time of  acquisition  is charged to the allowance for
loan losses. Any subsequent write-downs to reflect current fair market value, as
well as gains and losses on  disposition  and revenues and expenses  incurred in
maintaining  such  properties,  are treated as period  costs.  Other real estate
owned  totaled  $5.5  million and $11.4  million at December  31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and  equipment  are stated at cost less  accumulated  depreciation  and
amortization.  Depreciation and  amortization are computed on the  straight-line
method over the estimated  useful lives of the related assets or the lease term.
Maintenance  and repairs are charged to expense as incurred,  while additions or
major  improvements  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful
lives.  Estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets  are 3 to 20  years  for  land
improvements,  5 to 40 years for buildings, 3 to 5 years for computers, and 3 to
20 years for furniture,  fixtures,  and other equipment.  Leasehold improvements
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease terms or the
estimated useful lives of the improvements.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The excess of the cost of an  acquisition  over the fair value of the net assets
acquired  consist  primarily of goodwill,  core deposit  intangibles,  and other
intangibles (primarily related to customer relationships acquired). Core deposit
intangibles  have finite  lives and are  amortized  on an  accelerated  basis to
expense over periods of 7 to 10 years.  The other  intangibles have finite lives
and are  amortized on an  accelerated  basis to expense over a weighted  average
life  of 16  years.  The  Corporation  reviews  long-lived  assets  and  certain
identifiable   intangibles   for  impairment   whenever  events  or  changes  in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  may  not  be
recoverable, in which case an impairment charge would be recorded.

Prior to January 1, 2002,  goodwill was  amortized to expense over periods up to
40 years for  acquisitions  made  before 1983 and for periods up to 25 years for
acquisitions  made after 1982. The Corporation  adopted SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill
and Other  Intangible  Assets," ("SFAS 142") and SFAS No. 147,  "Acquisitions of
Certain Financial  Institutions,"  ("SFAS 147") effective January 1, 2002. Under
SFAS 142,  goodwill and indefinite life  intangibles are no longer amortized but
are subject to

                                       57
<PAGE>

impairment  tests on at least an annual  basis.  Any  impairment  of goodwill or
intangibles  will be recognized as an expense in the period of  impairment.  The
Corporation was required to complete the transitional  goodwill  impairment test
within six months of adoption of SFAS 142 and to record the impairment,  if any,
by the end of the  fiscal  year.  The  Corporation  completed  the  transitional
goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of 2002 as of January 1, 2002. No
impairment  loss was  recorded  as of January 1, 2002.  No  impairment  loss was
necessary from the January 1, 2002, and May 1, 2002 and 2003,  impairment  tests
described above under the Corporation's adoption of SFAS 142, including the $7.4
million  of  goodwill  related  to SFAS 147.  Note 5  includes  a summary of the
Corporation's goodwill, core deposit intangibles, and other intangibles. Note 19
provides  disclosures  regarding  the  impact  of SFAS  142 and  SFAS 147 on the
Corporation's consolidated financial statements.

SFAS 147 amends SFAS No. 72, "Accounting for Certain  Acquisitions of Banking or
Thrift  Institutions,"  ("SFAS  72") to  remove  the  acquisition  of  financial
institutions  from the scope of that  statement  and  provides  guidance  on the
accounting   for   the   impairment   or   disposal   of   acquired    long-term
customer-relationship  intangible assets. Except for transactions between two or
more  mutual   enterprises,   SFAS  147  requires   acquisitions   of  financial
institutions that meet the definition of a business  combination to be accounted
for in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business  Combinations,"  ("SFAS 141") and
SFAS 142. The  provisions  of SFAS 147 were  effective on October 1, 2002,  with
earlier  application  permitted.  The  Corporation  adopted  SFAS 147  effective
September  30, 2002.  At January 1, 2002,  the  Corporation  had $7.4 million of
goodwill from certain business  combinations that was continuing to be amortized
in 2002 under SFAS 72, prior to the  issuance of SFAS 147.  With the adoption of
SFAS  147,  which  removed  certain  acquisitions  from the scope of SFAS 72 and
included  them under SFAS 142, the  Corporation  ceased such  amortization.  The
amount  of  such  amortization  was  $0.25  million  pre-tax  per  quarter,   or
approximately  0.3 of a cent of diluted  earnings per share per quarter in 2002.
The Corporation  discontinued such  amortization  effective January 1, 2002, the
same date as the Corporation's  adoption of SFAS 142, and has restated any prior
financial information as required by SFAS 147.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

The Corporation  sells  residential  mortgage loans in the secondary  market and
typically  retains the right to service the loans  sold.  Upon sale,  a mortgage
servicing  rights asset is capitalized,  which  represents the then current fair
value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing  servicing
activities. Mortgage servicing rights, when purchased, are initially recorded at
cost.  Mortgage  servicing  rights  are  carried  at the  lower  of the  initial
capitalized  amount,  net of accumulated  amortization,  or fair value,  and are
included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Mortgage
servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated
servicing income.

The Corporation  periodically  evaluates its mortgage servicing rights asset for
impairment.  Impairment  is  assessed  using  stratifications  based on the risk
characteristics  of the  underlying  loans,  such  as bulk  acquisitions  versus
loan-by-loan,  loan type, interest rate, and estimated  prepayment speeds of the
underlying  mortgages  serviced.  The  value of  mortgage  servicing  rights  is
adversely  affected  when  mortgage  interest  rates  decline and mortgage  loan
prepayments  increase.  A valuation  allowance is  established to the extent the
carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights exceeds the estimated fair value
by  stratification.  If it is later determined all or a portion of the temporary
impairment no longer  exists for a  stratification,  the valuation  allowance is
reduced  through a recovery  to  earnings.  An  other-than-temporary  impairment
(i.e.,  recoverability is considered remote when considering  interest rates and
loan pay off activity) is  recognized as a write-down of the mortgage  servicing
rights  asset and the  related  valuation  allowance  (to the extent a valuation
reserve is available) and then against earnings. A direct write-down permanently
reduces the carrying value of the mortgage  servicing rights asset and valuation
allowance, precluding subsequent recoveries.

Income Taxes

Amounts  provided  for  income  tax  expense  are based on income  reported  for
financial statement purposes and do not necessarily  represent amounts currently
payable under tax laws.  Deferred  income taxes,  which arise  principally  from
temporary  differences  between the period in which certain  income and expenses
are  recognized for financial  accounting  purposes and the period in which they
affect taxable income, are included in the amounts provided for income taxes. In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether
it is more likely than not that some  portion or all of the  deferred tax assets
will not be  realized.  The  ultimate  realization  of  deferred  tax  assets is
dependent  upon the  generation of future  taxable  income during the periods in
which those temporary  differences become deductible.  Management  considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
and tax planning  strategies in making this assessment.  Based upon the level of
historical  taxable  income and  projections  for future taxable income over the
period which the deferred tax assets are deductible,  management  believes it is
more  likely  than  not the  Corporation  will  realize  the  benefits  of these
deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances at December 31,
2003.

The  Corporation  files a consolidated  federal income tax return and individual
Parent Company and  subsidiary  state income tax returns.  Accordingly,  amounts
equal to tax benefits of those  subsidiaries  having  taxable  federal losses or
credits are offset by other subsidiaries that incur federal tax liabilities.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as
amended by SFAS No. 138,  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments  and
Certain Hedging  Activities,"  and SFAS No. 149,  "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities,"  (collectively  referred to as
"SFAS 133") requires derivative  instruments,  including derivative  instruments
embedded in other  contracts,  to be carried at fair value on the balance  sheet
with changes in the fair value recorded directly in earnings.  As required,  the
Corporation  adopted  SFAS  133 on  January  1,  2001.  In  accordance  with the
transition  provisions  of SFAS 133, upon  adoption the  Corporation  recorded a
cumulative  effect of $1.3  million,  net of taxes of $843,000,  in  accumulated
other  comprehensive  income to recognize at fair value all derivatives that are
designated as cash flow hedge  instruments.  Due to immateriality,  net gains on
derivatives  designated  as fair value  hedges  were  recorded  in  earnings  at
adoption.

All derivatives are recognized on the  consolidated  balance sheet at their fair
value.  On the date the  derivative  contract is entered into,  the  Corporation
designates the  derivative,  except for mortgage  banking  derivatives for which
changes in fair value of the  derivative  is recorded in  earnings,  as either a
fair  value  hedge  (i.e.,  a hedge of the fair value of a  recognized  asset or
liability) or a cash flow hedge (i.e., a hedge of the  variability of cash flows
to be  received  or paid  related  to a  recognized  asset  or  liability).  The
Corporation formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedging  items,  as well as its  risk  management  objective  and  strategy  for
undertaking  various  hedge  transactions.  This  process  includes  linking all
derivatives  that are  designated  as fair value  hedges or cash flow  hedges to
specific  assets or  liabilities  on the balance  sheet.  The  Corporation  also
formally  assesses,  both at the  hedge's  inception  and on an  ongoing  basis,
whether  the  derivatives  that  are used in  hedging  transactions  are  highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If
it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it
has ceased to be a highly effective hedge,  the Corporation  discontinues  hedge
accounting prospectively.

For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value
of the  derivative  and of the hedged item  attributable  to the hedged risk are
recognized  in earnings.  If the  derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge,
the  effective  portions  of  changes in the fair  value of the  derivative  are
recorded in other comprehensive  income and the ineffective  portions of changes
in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.

The  Corporation   discontinues  hedge  accounting   prospectively  when  it  is
determined that the derivative is no longer  effective in offsetting  changes in
the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item,

                                       59
<PAGE>

the derivative expires or is sold, terminated,  or exercised,  the derivative is
dedesignated as a hedging instrument,  or management determines that designation
of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer  appropriate.  When hedge
accounting  is  discontinued  because it is  determined  that the  derivative no
longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the Corporation  continues to
carry  the  derivative  on the  balance  sheet at its fair  value  and no longer
adjusts the hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value.  The adjustment
of the carrying  amount of the hedged asset or liability is accounted for in the
same  manner  as  other  components  of the  carrying  amount  of that  asset or
liability.

Stock-Based Compensation

As allowed under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation" ("SFAS
123") and SFAS No. 148,  "Accounting for  Stock-Based  Compensation - Transition
and  Disclosure  - an  amendment  of SFAS  123," the  Corporation  accounts  for
stock-based  compensation  cost under the  intrinsic  value method of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB
25),  and related  Interpretations,  under which no  compensation  cost has been
recognized for any periods  presented,  except with respect to restricted  stock
awards.  Compensation  expense  for  employee  stock  options is  generally  not
recognized if the exercise  price of the option equals or exceeds the fair value
of the stock on the date of grant, as such options would have no intrinsic value
at the date of grant.

The  Corporation  may issue  common  stock  with  restrictions  to  certain  key
employees.  The shares are restricted as to transfer but are not restricted as
to dividend payment or voting rights.  Transfer restrictions lapse over three or
five years, depending upon whether the award is fixed or performance-based,  are
contingent upon continued  employment,  and for performance  awards are based on
earnings per share performance goals. The Corporation amortizes the expense over
the vesting period.  During 2003,  50,000  restricted stock shares were awarded,
and expense of  approximately  $451,000 was recorded for the year ended December
31, 2003.

For purposes of providing the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS 123, the
fair value of stock options granted in 2003, 2002, and 2001 was estimated at the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes  option pricing model,  which was originally
developed  for use in  estimating  the fair  value of traded  options  that have
different  characteristics  from the Corporation's  employee stock options.  The
model is also  sensitive  to  changes  in the  subjective  assumptions  that can
materially affect the fair value estimate. As a result,  management believes the
Black-Scholes model may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of employee stock options. The following table illustrates the effect
on net income and  earnings  per share if the  Corporation  had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS 123.

The following  assumptions  were used in  estimating  the fair value for options
granted in 2003, 2002, and 2001:

                                                                               2003            2002         2001

Risk-free interest rate                                                        3.27%           4.58%        5.09%
Weighted average expected life                                                 7 yrs           7 yrs        7 yrs
Expected volatility                                                           28.29%          28.35%       26.07%

</TABLE>

The weighted average per share fair values of options granted in 2003, 2002, and
2001 were $8.08, $7.73, and $7.06,  respectively.  The annual expense allocation
methodology  prescribed  by SFAS  123  attributes  a  higher  percentage  of the
reported  expense  to  earlier  years  than  to  later  years,  resulting  in an
accelerated expense recognition for proforma disclosure purposes.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For  purposes  of the  consolidated  statements  of cash  flows,  cash  and cash
equivalents are considered to include cash and due from banks,  interest-bearing
deposits in other financial institutions,  and federal funds sold and securities
purchased under agreements to resell.

Per Share Computations

Basic  earnings per share is  calculated  by dividing net income by the weighted
average  number of common  shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings  per share is
calculated  by  dividing  net income by the  weighted  average  number of shares
adjusted for the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options. Also see Notes 11
and 19.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In  December  2003,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No.  132  (revised  December  2003),
"Employers'  Disclosures about Pensions and Other  Postretirement  Benefits,  an
amendment  of FASB  Statements  No.  87, 88, and 106,"  ("SFAS  132").  SFAS 132
revises  employers'  disclosures  about pension  plans and other  postretirement
benefit plans.  This Statement does not change the measurement or recognition of
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans required by FASB Statements
No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," No. 88, "Employers' Accounting for
Settlements   and   Curtailments  of  Defined  Benefit  Pension  Plans  and  for
Termination  Benefits," and No. 106,  "Employers'  Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits  Other Than  Pensions."  The revised  SFAS 132  retains the  disclosure
requirements  contained  in  the  original  SFAS  132  and  requires  additional
disclosures about the assets, obligations,  cash flows, and net periodic benefit
cost of defined benefit  pension plans and other defined benefit  postretirement
plans.  In general,  the annual  provisions of SFAS 132 are effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2003,  and the  interim-period  disclosures  are
effective for interim  periods  beginning  after December 15, 2003. The adoption
had no effect on the Corporation's results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity.

In May 2003,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,  "Accounting  for Certain  Financial
Instruments with  Characteristics  of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150").
SFAS 150 establishes standards for how

                                       61
<PAGE>

an  issuer   classifies  and  measures   certain   financial   instruments  with
characteristics  of both  liabilities  and  equity.  SFAS 150 is  effective  for
financial  instruments,  except mandatorily  redeemable  financial  instruments,
entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. For certain mandatorily  redeemable
financial  instruments  the effective date has been deferred  indefinitely.  The
adoption had no effect on the  Corporation's  results of  operations,  financial
position, or liquidity.

In April 2003,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,  "Amendment  of  Statement  133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 149"). SFAS 149 amends and
clarifies  financial  accounting  and  reporting  for  derivative   instruments,
including certain derivative  instruments  embedded in other contracts,  and for
hedging  activities under SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities."  This Statement amends SFAS No. 133 for decisions made
as part of the Derivatives  Implementation  Group process and in connection with
implementation issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of
a derivative. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003. The adoption had no material impact on the Corporation's  results
of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

In January  2003,  the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 46,  "Consolidation  of
Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). This interpretation provides guidance on
how to  identify  a variable  interest  entity and  determine  when the  assets,
liabilities,  noncontrolling  interests, and results of operations of a variable
interest  entity  are  to be  included  in an  entity's  consolidated  financial
statements.  A variable  interest  entity  exists when  either the total  equity
investment  at risk is not  sufficient  to  permit  the  entity to  finance  its
activities by itself, or the equity investors lack one of three  characteristics
associated with owning a controlling  financial interest.  Those characteristics
include  the direct or  indirect  ability to make  decisions  about an  entity's
activities through voting rights or similar rights, the obligation to absorb the
expected losses of an entity if they occur, or the right to receive the expected
residual  returns of the entity if they  occur.  The  adoption  had no  material
impact on the  Corporation's  results  of  operations,  financial  position,  or
liquidity.

In  December   2003,   the  FASB  reissued  FIN  46  ("FIN  46R")  with  certain
modifications  and  clarifications.  Application  of FIN 46R was  effective  for
interests in certain variable interest entities as of December 31, 2003, and for
all other types of variable interest entities for periods ending after March 15,
2004,  unless FIN 46 was  previously  applied.  The  application of FIN 46R will
result in the deconsolidation of a subsidiary relating to the issuance of trust
preferred securities.  The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary trust were
deconsolidated in the first quarter of 2004 and totaled $180  million.  See Note
10 for further discussion of this trust and the Corporation's related
obligations.  The Corporation does not believe that the application of FIN 46R
had a material impact on the results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity.

In December 2003, the AICPA's Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee issued
Statement  of Position  ("SOP")  03-3,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Loans or Debt
Securities Acquired in a Transfer," ("SOP 03-3"). SOP 03-3 addresses  accounting
for  differences  between  contractual  cash flows and cash flows expected to be
collected  from an investor's  initial  investment  in loans or debt  securities
acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable,  at least in part,
to credit  quality.  The provisions of this SOP are effective for loans acquired
in fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15, 2004. The  Corporation  does not
expect the  requirements of SOP 03-3 to have a material impact on the results of
operations, financial position, or liquidity.

NOTE 2 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:

In 2003 there was one  completed  business  combination.  On April 1, 2003,  the
Corporation  consummated its cash acquisition of 100% of the outstanding  shares
of CFG, a closely-held insurance agency headquartered in Minnetonka,  Minnesota.
Effective in June 2003, CFG operated as Associated Financial Group, LLC. CFG, an
independent,  full-line  insurance agency, was acquired to enhance the growth of
the Corporation's existing insurance business. The acquisition was accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting;  thus, the results of operations  prior
to the  consummation  date were not  included in the  accompanying  consolidated
financial  statements.   The  acquisition  is  individually

                                       62
<PAGE>

immaterial to the consolidated financial results.  Goodwill of approximately $12
million and other  intangibles of  approximately  $15 million  recognized in the
transaction at acquisition were assigned to the wealth management segment.

There was one completed business  combination during 2002. On February 28, 2002,
the Corporation  consummated  its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding  common
shares of Signal. Signal operated banking branches in nine locations in the Twin
Cities and Eastern  Minnesota.  As a result of the acquisition,  the Corporation
expanded its Minnesota banking presence, particularly in the Twin Cities area.

The  Signal   transaction  was  accounted  for  under  the  purchase  method  of
accounting;  thus, the results of operations prior to the consummation date were
not included in the accompanying  consolidated financial statements.  The Signal
transaction was consummated  through the issuance of  approximately  4.1 million
shares of common stock and $58.4 million in cash for a purchase  price of $192.5
million. The value of the shares was determined using the closing stock price of
the  Corporation's  stock on September  10,  2001,  the  initiation  date of the
transaction.

The following  table  summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed of Signal at the date of the acquisition.

</TABLE>

Management  does not believe any individual  unrealized  loss as of December 31,
2003  represents  an  other-than-temporary  impairment.  The  unrealized  losses
reported for  mortgage-related  securities relate primarily to securities issued
by government  agencies such as the Federal  National  Mortgage  Association and
Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation  ("FHLMC").  These unrealized losses are
primarily  attributable to changes in interest rates and individually were 4% or
less of their  respective  amortized cost basis. Not included in the above table
is a CMO  (included  in  mortgage-related  securities)  determined  to  have  an
other-than-temporary impairment that resulted in a write-down on the security of
$0.8  million  during  2002 and $0.3  million  during  2003  based on  continued
evaluation.  As

                                       64
<PAGE>

of  December  31,  2003,  this CMO had a  carrying  value of $1.8  million.  The
unrealized  losses  associated  with the other equity  securities  are comprised
primarily of FHLMC preferred stock and is predominantly  attributable to changes
in interest  rates.  At December 31,  2003,  the  amortized  cost of these FHLMC
preferred  shares was $8.7  million,  based on $50 per  share,  while the market
value per share was  approximately  $44. The Corporation  currently has both the
intent and ability to hold the securities  contained in the previous table for a
time necessary to recover the amortized cost.

The amortized cost and fair values of investment  securities  available for sale
at December  31,  2003,  by  contractual  maturity,  are shown  below.  Expected
maturities will differ from contractual  maturities  because  borrowers may have
the right to call or  prepay  obligations  with or  without  call or  prepayment
penalties.

The Corporation has granted loans to their  directors,  executive  officers,  or
their  related  subsidiaries.  These loans were made on  substantially  the same
terms,  including  rates and  collateral,  as those  prevailing  at the time for
comparable transactions with other unrelated customers,  and do not involve more
than a normal risk of collection.  These loans to related parties are summarized
as follows:

The  Corporation  serves the credit  needs of its  customers  by offering a wide
variety of loan programs to customers,  primarily in  Wisconsin,  Illinois,  and
Minnesota.  The loan  portfolio  is widely  diversified  by

                                       66
<PAGE>

types  of  borrowers,  industry  groups,  and  market  areas.  Significant  loan
concentrations  are considered to exist for a financial  institution  when there
are  amounts  loaned  to a  multiple  number of  borrowers  engaged  in  similar
activities  that would cause them to be similarly  impacted by economic or other
conditions.  At December 31, 2003, no significant  concentrations existed in the
Corporation's loan portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans.

NOTE 5 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS:

Goodwill:

Goodwill  is not  amortized  but is subject to  impairment  tests on at least an
annual basis. No impairment loss was necessary in 2003, 2002, or 2001.  Goodwill
of $212  million is assigned to the banking  segment and goodwill of $12 million
is assigned to the wealth management segment.  The change in the carrying amount
of goodwill was as follows.

Goodwill                                                     2003        2002

Goodwill amortization expense was zero for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002, and $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. See Note 19 for the
disclosure of net income and per share amounts excluding goodwill  amortization,
net of any income tax  effects,  due to the adoption of SFAS 142 and SFAS 147 in
2002.

Other Intangible Assets:
-----------------------

The Corporation has other  intangible  assets that are amortized,  consisting of
core  deposit  intangibles,  other  intangibles  (primarily  related to customer
relationships  acquired in connection  with the CFG  acquisition),  and mortgage
servicing rights. The core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing rights are
assigned to the Corporation's  banking segment,  while the other intangibles are
assigned to the Corporation's wealth management segment.

For core  deposit  intangibles  and  other  intangibles,  changes  in the  gross
carrying amount, accumulated amortization, and net book value were as follows.

                                                             2003        2002

Mortgage  servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of
estimated servicing income. The Corporation  periodically evaluates its mortgage
servicing rights asset for impairment.  A valuation  allowance is established to
the extent the  carrying  value of the mortgage  servicing  rights

                                       67
<PAGE>

exceeds the  estimated  fair value by  stratification.  An  other-than-temporary
impairment is recognized as a write-down of the mortgage  servicing rights asset
and  the  related  valuation  allowance  (to the  extent  valuation  reserve  is
available)  and then against  earnings.  During the second and third quarters of
2003  mortgage  rates  fell  to  record  lows.  Given  the  extended  period  of
historically  low  interest  rates and the impact on mortgage  banking  volumes,
refinances,  and  secondary  markets,  the  Corporation  evaluated  its mortgage
servicing  rights  asset  for  possible  other-than-temporary  impairment.  As a
result,  $18.1  million was  determined  to be other than  temporarily  impaired
during  2003.  A summary  of changes in the  balance of the  mortgage  servicing
rights  asset and the  mortgage  servicing  rights  valuation  allowance  was as
follows.

At  December  31,  2003,  the  Corporation  was  servicing  one- to  four-family
residential mortgage loans owned by other investors with balances totaling $5.93
billion  compared to $5.44  billion and $5.23  billion at December  31, 2002 and
2001,   respectively.   The  fair  value  of  mortgage   servicing   rights  was
approximately  $42.5 million  (representing 72 bp of loans serviced) at December
31, 2003,  compared to $32.3 million  (representing  59 bp of loans serviced) at
December 31, 2002, and $32.1 million  (representing  61 bp of loans serviced) at
December 31, 2001.

Mortgage  servicing  rights  expense,  which  includes the  amortization  of the
mortgage servicing rights and increases or decreases to the valuation  allowance
associated with the mortgage servicing rights, was $29.6 million, $30.5 million,
and $20.0  million  for the years  ended  December  31,  2003,  2002,  and 2001,
respectively.

The  following  table  shows  the  estimated  future  amortization  expense  for
amortizing  intangible assets.  The projections of amortization  expense for the
next five years are based on existing asset balances,  the current interest rate
environment,  and  prepayment  speeds  as  of  December  31,  2003.  The  actual
amortization  expense  the  Corporation  recognizes  in any given  period may be
significantly  different  depending  upon  changes  in  interest  rates,  market
conditions,  regulatory requirements,  and events or circumstances that indicate
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

The  Corporation  and  certain  subsidiaries  are  obligated  under a number  of
noncancelable  operating leases for other  facilities and equipment,  certain of
which  provide for  increased  rentals  based upon  increases  in cost of living
adjustments and other operating  costs.  The approximate  minimum annual rentals
and commitments under these  noncancelable  agreements and leases with remaining
terms in excess of one year are as follows:

Included in  short-term  borrowings  are Federal  Home Loan Bank  advances  with
original  maturities  of less  than one  year.  The  short-term  bank  notes are

loan  notes are  demand  notes  representing  secured  borrowings  from the U.S.
Treasury, collateralized by qualifying securities and loans.

At December 31, 2003, the Parent  Company had $100 million of established  lines
of credit with various  nonaffiliated banks, which were not drawn on at December
31, 2003.  Borrowings  under these lines accrue  interest at  short-term  market
rates.  Under the terms of the  credit  agreement,  a variety  of  advances  and
interest  periods may be selected by the Parent  Company.  During  2000,  a $200
million  commercial  paper  program was  initiated,  of which,  no amounts  were
outstanding at December 31, 2003 or 2002.

(1)  Long-term  advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank had maturities  through
     2017 and had weighted-average interest rates of 2.96% at December 31, 2003,
     and 3.74% at December 31, 2002.  These  advances had a combination of fixed
     and variable rates,  predominantly  fixed.  Of the balances  outstanding at

(2)  The   long-term   bank   notes  had   maturities   through   2007  and  had
     weighted-average interest rates of 2.20% at December 31, 2003, and 2.15% at
     December 31, 2002.  These  advances had a combination of fixed and variable
     rates.
(3)  In August 2001, the Corporation issued $200 million of 10-year subordinated
     debt.  This debt was issued at a discount and has a fixed  interest rate of
     6.75%.  During  2001,  the  Corporation  entered into a fair value hedge to
     hedge the interest rate risk on the  subordinated  debt. As of December 31,
     2003 and 2002, the fair value of the derivative was a $5.5 million gain and
     a $9.6 million gain,  respectively.  The subordinated  debt qualifies under
     the  risk-based  capital  guidelines  as Tier 2  supplementary  capital for
     regulatory purposes.
(4)  The long-term  repurchase  agreements had  maturities  through 2006 and had
     weighted-average  interest rates of 1.67% at December 31, 2003 and 2.36% at
     December 31, 2002.  These  advances had a combination of fixed and variable
     rates,  predominantly  fixed.  Of the balances  outstanding at December 31,

Under  agreements  with the  Federal  Home Loan Banks of Chicago and Des Moines,
Federal Home Loan Bank advances  (short-term  and  long-term) are secured by the
subsidiary   banks'   qualifying   mortgages  (such  as  residential   mortgage,
residential  mortgage  loans held for sale,  home equity,  and  commercial  real
estate) and by specific investment securities for certain Federal Home Loan Bank
advances.

Note 10 COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES:

On May 30, 2002,  ASBC Capital I (the "ASBC Trust"),  a Delaware  business trust
wholly owned by the  Corporation,  completed  the sale of $175 million of 7.625%
preferred securities (the "Preferred Securities").  The Preferred Securities are
traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "ABW PRA." The ASBC Trust
used the proceeds  from the offering to purchase a like amount of 7.625%  Junior
Subordinated  Debentures (the  "Debentures") of the Corporation.  The Debentures
are the sole assets of the ASBC Trust and are eliminated, along with the related
income  statement  effects,  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements.   The
Corporation  used the  proceeds  from the sales of the  Debentures  for  general
corporate purposes.

Effective  in the first  quarter of 2004,  in  accordance  with recent  guidance
provided on the  application  of FIN 46R,  the  Corporation  will be required to
deconsolidate  the  ASBC  Trust  from  its  consolidated  financial  statements.
Accordingly,  the Debentures issued by the Corporation to ASBC Trust (as opposed
to the trust preferred securities issued by the ASBC Trust) will be reflected in
the   Corporation's   consolidated   balance  sheet  as  long-term   debt.   The
deconsolidation  of the net assets and results of  operations of this trust will
have virtually no impact on the  Corporation's  financial  statements  since the
Corporation  continues to be obligated to repay the Debentures  held by the ASBC
Trust and guarantees  repayment of the Preferred  Securities  issued by the ASBC
Trust. The consolidated long-term debt obligation related to the ASBC Trust will
increase  from $175  million  to $180  million  upon  deconsolidation,  with the
difference  representing the Corporation's common ownership interest in the ASBC
Trust recorded in investment securities available for sale.

The Preferred Securities accrue and pay dividends quarterly at an annual rate of
7.625% of the  stated  liquidation  amount of $25 per  Preferred  Security.  The
Corporation has fully and  unconditionally  guaranteed all of the obligations of
the ASBC Trust. The guarantee covers the quarterly distributions and payments on
liquidation or redemption of the Preferred Securities, but only to the extent of
funds held by the ASBC Trust.

                                       71
<PAGE>

The Preferred  Securities are  mandatorily  redeemable  upon the maturity of the
Debentures  on June 15,  2032,  or upon  earlier  redemption  as provided in the
Indenture.  The  Corporation  has the right to redeem the Debentures on or after
May 30, 2007.

The Preferred Securities qualify under the risk-based capital guidelines as Tier
1 capital for regulatory  purposes.  As discussed in Note 18, as a result of FIN
46R, the Federal Reserve Board is currently  evaluating whether  deconsolidation
of the trust will affect the qualification of the preferred securities as Tier 1
capital. If it is determined that the preferred  securities no longer qualify as
Tier 1  capital,  the  effect of such a change  is not  expected  to affect  the
Corporation's well-capitalized status.

During May 2002,  the  Corporation  entered into a fair value hedge to hedge the
interest rate risk on the  Debentures.  The fair value of the  derivative  was a
$6.9 million gain at December 31, 2003, and a $15.1 million gain at December 31,
2002.  Given the fair value hedge,  the Preferred  Securities are carried on the
balance sheet at fair value.

Note 11 Stockholders' Equity:

On April 24, 2002, the Board of Directors declared a 10% stock dividend, payable
May 15 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 29. All share
and per share data in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements has
been adjusted to reflect the 10% stock  dividend  paid. As a result of the stock
dividend, the Corporation distributed approximately 7.0 million shares of common
stock.  Any  fractional  shares  resulting  from the dividend were paid in cash.
Share and price  information  has been  adjusted to reflect all stock splits and
dividends.

The  Corporation's  Articles of Incorporation  authorize the issuance of 750,000
shares of preferred stock at a par value of $1.00 per share. No shares have been
issued.

At December 31, 2003,  subsidiary  net assets  equaled  $1.3  billion,  of which
approximately $136.8 million could be transferred to the Corporation in the form
of cash  dividends  without prior  regulatory  approval,  subject to the capital
needs of each subsidiary.

The Board of Directors has  authorized  management  to repurchase  shares of the
Corporation's  common stock each quarter in the market, to be made available for
issuance in connection with the Corporation's  employee  incentive plans and for
other corporate  purposes.  For the Corporation's  employee incentive plans, the
Board  of  Directors  authorized  the  repurchase  of up to 1.6  million  shares
(400,000  shares  per  quarter)  in 2003  and  2002.  Of  these  authorizations,
approximately  1.3 million shares were repurchased for $43.3 million during 2002
(with approximately 1.0 million shares reissued in connection with stock options
exercised),  while none were  repurchased  during 2003 (with  approximately  1.1
million   shares   reissued  in  connection   with  stock  options   exercised).
Additionally,  under two  separate  actions in 2000 and one action in 2003,  the
Board  of  Directors   authorized  the  repurchase  and   cancellation   of  the
Corporation's  outstanding  shares,  not to exceed  approximately  11.0  million
shares on a  combined  basis.  Under  these  authorizations,  approximately  2.1
million shares were repurchased for $74.5 million during 2003 at an average cost
of $36.17 per share,  while during 2002  approximately  1.3 million  shares were
repurchased  for $44.0  million  at an  average  cost of $32.69  per  share.  At
December  31,  2003,  approximately  3.7 million  shares  remain  authorized  to
repurchase.  The  repurchase  of shares  will be based on market  opportunities,
capital levels, growth prospects, and other investment opportunities.

The Board of Directors approved the implementation of a broad-based stock option
grant  effective July 28, 1999.  This stock option grant provided all qualifying
employees with an opportunity  and an incentive to buy shares of the Corporation
and align their financial interest with the growth in value of the Corporation's
shares.  These  options have 10-year  terms,  fully vest in two years,  and have
exercise  prices  equal to 100% of  market  value on the  date of  grant.  As of
December  31,  2003,  approximately  1.8 million  shares  remain  available  for
granting.

In  January  2002,  the Board of  Directors,  with  subsequent  approval  of the
Corporation's  shareholders,  approved an  amendment,  increasing  the number of
shares  available  to be issued by an  additional

                                       72
<PAGE>

3.3 million shares, to the Amended and Restated  Long-Term  Incentive Stock Plan
("Stock  Plan").  The  Stock  Plan was  adopted  by the Board of  Directors  and
originally approved by shareholders in 1987 and amended in 1994, 1997, and 1998.
Options are generally exercisable up to 10 years from the date of grant and vest
over two to three  years.  As of December 31,  2003,  approximately  3.2 million
shares remain available for grants.

The  stock  incentive  plans  of  acquired  companies  were  terminated  at each
respective   merger  date.   Option   holders  under  such  plans  received  the
Corporation's  common stock, or options to buy the  Corporation's  common stock,
based on the conversion terms of the various merger  agreements.  The historical
option  information  presented  below has been  restated  to reflect the options
originally granted under the acquired companies' plans.

NOTE 12 RETIREMENT PLANS:

The  Corporation  has a  noncontributory  defined  benefit  retirement plan (the
"Plan") covering  substantially all full-time employees.  The benefits are based
primarily  on  years  of  service  and the  employee's  compensation  paid.  The
Corporation's  funding policy is to pay at least the minimum amount  required by
the funding requirements of federal law and regulations.

The following tables set forth the Plan's funded status and net periodic benefit
cost:

The overall  expected  long-term rate of return on assets was 8.75% and 9.00% as
of December  31, 2003 and 2002,  respectively.  The expected  long-term  rate of
return was estimated  using market  benchmarks for equities and bonds applied to
the plan's  anticipated asset  allocations.  The expected return on equities was
computed utilizing a valuation  framework,  which projected future returns based
on current equity valuations rather than historical returns.

The asset  allocation for the Plan as of the measurement  date by asset category
was as follows:

                                                          2003          2002

                                                      =========================

The asset classes used to manage plan assets will include common  stocks,  fixed
income or debt securities,  and cash equivalents.  A diversified portfolio using
these assets will provide  liquidity,  current income,  and growth of income and
growth  of  principal.  The  anticipated  asset  allocation  ranges  are  equity
securities of 55-65%,  debt securities of 35-45%,  and other cash equivalents of
0-5%.

The  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries  also  have a Profit  Sharing/Retirement
Savings Plan (the "plan"). The Corporation's contribution is determined annually
by the  Administrative  Committee  of the Board of  Directors,  based in part on
performance-based  formulas  provided  in the plan.  Total  expense  related  to
contributions to the plan was $12.3 million, $11.8 million, and $10.5 million in
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

An  additional  pension  obligation  is required  when the  accumulated  benefit
obligation  exceeds  the sum of the fair value of plan  assets  and the  accrued
pension  expense.  At December 31, 2003, the  Corporation's  additional  pension
obligation was zero,  while at December 31, 2002, the  Corporation's  additional
pension  obligation was $16.1  million,  of which $9.2 million was included as a
reduction in accumulated other comprehensive  income, net of tax benefit of $6.2
million,  and $0.7 million was included as an intangible  asset as part of other
assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

At this time,  the  Corporation  does not expect to make a  contribution  to its
pension  plan in 2004.  The  Corporation  regularly  reviews  the funding of its
pension plans. Therefore, it is possible that after that review, the Corporation
may decide to make a contribution to the pension plan at that time.

Components of the 2002 net deferred tax assets have been adjusted to reflect the
filing of corporate income tax returns.

For financial reporting  purposes,  a valuation allowance has been recognized to
offset deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss  carryforwards of
certain subsidiaries and other temporary differences due to the uncertainty that
the assets will be  realized.  If it is  subsequently  determined  that all or a
portion of these deferred tax assets will be realized, the tax benefit for these
items will be used to reduce deferred tax expense for that period.

At December 31, 2003,  the  Corporation  had state net operating  losses of $209
million and federal net operating losses of $1.3 million that will expire in the
years 2004 through 2017.

The effective  income tax rate differs from the statutory  federal tax rate. The
major reasons for this difference are as follows:

                                                       2003     2002     2001

A savings bank acquired by the Corporation in 1997 qualified under provisions of
the  Internal  Revenue Code that  permitted it to deduct from taxable  income an
allowance for bad debts that differed from the provision for such losses charged
to income for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, no provision for income
taxes has been made for $79.2  million of retained  income at December 31, 2003.
If income taxes had been  provided,  the deferred tax liability  would have been
approximately  $31.8 million.  Management  does not expect this amount to become
taxable in the future, therefore no provision for income taxes has been made.

NOTE 14 COMMITMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES:

Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Risk

The Corporation utilizes a variety of financial instruments in the normal course
of business to meet the  financial  needs of its customers and to manage its own
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial  instruments include
lending-related commitments.

Lending-related Commitments

Through the normal  course of  operations,  the  Corporation  has  entered  into
certain contractual  obligations and other commitments.  As a financial services
provider,  the Corporation  routinely  enters into commitments to extend credit.
While  contractual   obligations  represent  future  cash  requirements  of  the
Corporation,  a significant  portion of  commitments to extend credit may expire
without  being  drawn  upon.  Such  commitments  are  subject to the same credit
policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the Corporation.

Lending-related commitments include commitments to extend credit, commitments to
originate  residential  mortgage  loans  held for sale,  commercial  letters  of
credit,  and  standby  letters  of  credit.  Commitments  to extend  credit  are
agreements to lend to customers at predetermined interest rates as long as there
is no violation of any condition  established in the  contracts.  Commercial and
standby  letters of credit are conditional  commitments  issued to guarantee the
performance  of a customer to a third  party.  Commercial  letters of credit are
issued   specifically  to  facilitate  commerce  and  typically  result  in  the
commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between

                                       77
<PAGE>

the customer and the third party,  while standby letters of credit generally are
contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of
the underlying contract with the third party.

Under SFAS 133,  commitments  to originate  residential  mortgage loans held for
sale and forward  commitments to sell residential  mortgage loans are defined as
derivatives  and are  therefore  required  to be  recorded  on the  consolidated
balance sheet at fair value. The Corporation's  derivative and hedging activity,
as defined by SFAS 133, is further  summarized  in Note 15. The  following  is a
summary of lending-related commitments at December 31:

                                                          2003         2002
                                                      -------------------------
                                                           ($ in Thousands)
Commitments to extend credit, excluding
  commitments to originate mortgage loans (1)          $3,732,150   $3,559,497
Commercial letters of credit (1)                           19,665       59,186
Standby letters of credit (2)                             338,954      267,858

(1)  These off-balance sheet financial instruments are exercisable at the market
     rate  prevailing at the date the underlying  transaction  will be completed
     and thus are deemed to have no  current  fair  value,  or the fair value is
     based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements and is not
     material at December 31, 2003 or 2002.

(2)  As  required  by FASB  Interpretation  No.  45, an  interpretation  of FASB
     Statements  No. 5, 57,  and 107,  "Guarantor's  Accounting  and  Disclosure
     Requirements for Guarantees,  Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
     of Others," the  Corporation has established a liability of $2.3 million at
     December  31,  2003,  as an estimate  of the fair value of these  financial
     instruments. No fair value liability was required at December 31, 2002.

The Corporation's  exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
other party to these  financial  instruments is  represented by the  contractual
amount of those  instruments.  The commitments  generally have fixed  expiration
dates or  other  termination  clauses  and may  require  payment  of a fee.  The
Corporation uses the same credit policies in making  commitments and conditional
obligations  as it does  for  extending  loans  to  customers.  The  Corporation
evaluates each customer's  creditworthiness  on a case-by-case basis. The amount
of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Corporation upon extension of
credit, is based on management's  credit evaluation of the customer.  Since many
of the  commitments  are expected to expire  without being drawn upon, the total
commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Contingent Liabilities

In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation may be named as defendant in
or be a party to various pending and threatened  legal  proceedings.  In view of
the  intrinsic  difficulty  in  ascertaining  the outcome of such  matters,  the
Corporation  cannot state what the eventual  outcome of any such proceeding will
be. Management  believes,  based upon discussions with legal counsel and current
knowledge,  that  liabilities  arising out of any such proceedings (if any) will
not have a  material  adverse  effect on the  consolidated  financial  position,
results of operations, or liquidity of the Corporation.

As part of the  Corporation's  agency  agreement  with an  outside  vendor,  the
Corporation has guaranteed  certain credit card accounts provided the cardholder
is unable to meet the  credit  card  obligations.  At  December  31,  2003,  the
Corporation's estimated maximum exposure was approximately $1 million.

A contingent  liability is required to be established if it is probable that the
Corporation  will incur a loss on the performance of a letter of credit.  During
the second quarter of 2003, given the  deterioration of the financial  condition
of a  borrower,  the  Corporation  established  a  $2.5  million  liability  for
commercial  letters of credit,  of which $2.2  million  remained at December 31,
2003.

NOTE 15 DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:

The Corporation uses derivative  instruments  primarily to hedge the variability
in  interest  payments or protect  the value of certain  assets and  liabilities
recorded on its  consolidated  balance sheet from changes in interest rates. The
contract or notional amount of a derivative is used to determine, along with the
other  terms  of  the  derivative,  the  amounts  to be  exchanged  between  the
counterparties.  Because  the  contract or  notional  amount does not  represent
amounts  exchanged by the parties,  it is not a measure of loss exposure related
to the use of derivatives  nor of exposure to liquidity risk. The Corporation is
exposed  to credit  risk in the event of  nonperformance  by  counterparties  to
financial  instruments.  As the Corporation  generally enters into  transactions
only  with  high   quality   counterparties,   no   losses   with   counterparty
nonperformance on derivative  financial  instruments has occurred.  Further, the
Corporation  obtains  collateral  and  uses  master  netting  arrangements  when
available.   To  mitigate  counterparty  risk,  interest  rate  swap  agreements
generally contain language outlining  collateral pledging  requirements for each
counterparty.  Collateral must be posted when the market value exceeds a certain
threshold.  The threshold  limits are determined from the credit ratings of each
counterparty.   Upgrades  or  downgrades   to  the  credit   ratings  of  either
counterparty  would  lower or raise the  threshold  limits.  Market  risk is the
adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change
in interest rates, currency exchange rates, or commodity prices. The market risk
associated  with  interest  rate  contracts  is  managed  by  establishing   and
monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be
undertaken.

Interest rate swap  contracts are entered into  primarily as an  asset/liability
management  strategy to modify interest rate risk.  Interest rate swap contracts
are  exchanges of interest  payments,  such as fixed rate  payments for floating
rate payments,  based on a notional  principal  amount.  Payments related to the
Corporation's  swap contracts are made monthly,  quarterly,  or semi-annually by
one of the parties depending on the specific terms of the related contract.  The
primary risk  associated with all swaps is the exposure to movements in interest
rates and the ability of the  counterparties  to meet the terms of the contract.
At  December  31,  2003 and 2002,  the  Corporation  had $936  million  and $854
million,  respectively,  of interest  rate swaps  outstanding.  Included in this
amount were $361 million and $279  million,  respectively,  at December 31, 2003
and 2002,  in receive  variable/pay  fixed  interest  rate swaps used to convert
specific  fixed  rate  loans into  floating  rate  assets.  The  remaining  swap
contracts used for interest rate risk management of $575 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002,  were used to hedge  interest rate risk of various other specific
liabilities.  At December 31, 2003,  the  Corporation  pledged  $24.8 million of
collateral for swap agreements compared to $24.0 million at December 31, 2002.

Not included in the above table for December 31, 2003, were three customer swaps
with a notional  amount of $20.7  million for which the  Corporation  has mirror
swaps. There were no such customer swaps at December 31, 2002. The fair value of
these  customer  swaps is recorded  in earnings  and the net impact for 2003 was
immaterial.

Interest  rate floors and caps are interest  rate  protection  instruments  that
involve  the payment  from the seller to the buyer of an interest  differential.
This  differential  represents the difference  between a short-term  rate (e.g.,
six-month LIBOR) and an agreed upon rate (the strike rate) applied to a notional
principal amount. By buying a cap, the Corporation will be paid the differential
by a counterparty  should the short-term rate rise above the strike level of the
agreement.  The primary risk  associated  with purchased  floors and caps is the
ability of the counterparties to meet the terms of the agreement. As of December
31,  2003 and 2002,  the  Corporation  had  purchased  caps for  asset/liability
management of $200 million.

The Corporation  measures the  effectiveness  of its hedges on a periodic basis.
Any difference  between the fair value change of the hedge versus the fair value
change of the hedged item is considered to be the  "ineffective"  portion of the
hedge.  The  ineffective  portion of the hedge is  recorded  as an  increase  or
decrease  in the  related  income  statement  classification  of the item  being
hedged.  For the mortgage  derivatives,  which are not  accounted for as hedges,
changes in the fair value are  recorded as an  adjustment  to  mortgage  banking
income.

At December 31, 2003,  the  estimated  fair value of the interest rate swaps and
the cap designated as cash flow hedges was a $19.9 million  unrealized  loss, or
$11.9  million,  net of tax benefit of $8.0  million,  carried as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2002, the estimated fair
value of the interest rate swaps and the cap  designated as cash flow hedges was
a $23.2 million  unrealized  loss, or $13.9 million,  net of tax benefit of $9.3
million, carried as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These
instruments  are used to hedge  the  exposure  to the  variability  in  interest
payments of variable rate  liabilities.  The  ineffective  portion of the hedges
recorded  through the statements of income was  immaterial.  For the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Corporation  recognized interest expense of $7.7
million and $13.4 million,  respectively,  for interest rate swaps accounted for
as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2003,  approximately $7.8 million of the
deferred net losses on derivative  instruments  that are recorded in accumulated
other  comprehensive  income are expected to be reclassified to interest expense
within the next twelve months.  Currently,  none of the existing  amounts within
accumulated  other  comprehensive  income are expected to be  reclassified  into
earnings for ineffectiveness during 2003.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002,  the  estimated  fair value of the interest  rate
swaps designated as fair value hedges was an unrealized gain of $2.6 million and
an unrealized  gain of $10.0  million,  respectively,  carried as a component of
other  liabilities.  These  swaps  hedge  against  changes  in the fair value of
certain loans and long-term debt.

The fair value of the mortgage  derivatives at December 31, 2003, was a net loss
of $0.2 million, a decrease of $5.2 million from the December 31, 2002, net gain
of $5.0 million,  and is recorded in mortgage  banking income.  The $0.2 million
net fair value loss for  mortgage  derivatives  is  composed  of the net loss on
commitments to sell  approximately  $152.0 million of loans to various investors
and the net gain on commitments to fund approximately $114.1 million of loans to
individual  borrowers.  The $5.0  million  net  fair  value  gain  for  mortgage
derivatives is comprised of the net loss on  commitments  to sell  approximately

</TABLE>

Cash  and  due  from  banks,   interest-bearing   deposits  in  other  financial
institutions,  federal funds sold and securities  purchased under  agreements to
resell, and accrued interest receivable - For these short-term instruments,  the
carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Investment  securities  held to maturity,  investment  securities  available for
sale, and trading account  securities - The fair value of investment  securities
held to maturity,  investment securities available for sale, and trading account
securities, except certain state and municipal securities, is estimated based on
bid prices  published in financial  newspapers or bid  quotations  received from
securities dealers.  The fair value of certain state and municipal securities is
not readily  available through market sources other than dealer  quotations,  so
fair value  estimates are based on quoted market prices of similar  instruments,
adjusted for  differences  between the quoted  instruments  and the  instruments
being valued.  There were no investment  securities  held to maturity or trading
account securities at December 31, 2003 or 2002.

Loans  held  for  sale -  Fair  value  is  estimated  using  the  prices  of the
Corporation's  existing  commitments to sell such loans and/or the quoted market
prices for commitments to sell similar loans.

Loans - Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial
characteristics.  Loans are  segregated by type such as  commercial,  commercial
real estate,  residential  mortgage,  credit card, and other consumer.  The fair
value of other types of loans is estimated by discounting  the future cash

                                       83
<PAGE>

flows using the current  rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers
with similar  credit ratings and for similar  maturities.  Future cash flows are
also  adjusted  for  estimated   reductions  or  delays  due  to  delinquencies,
nonaccruals, or potential charge offs.

Deposits  - The  fair  value  of  deposits  with  no  stated  maturity  such  as
noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings,  interest-bearing demand deposits,
and  money  market  accounts,  is equal to the  amount  payable  on demand as of
December  31.  The  fair  value  of  certificates  of  deposit  is  based on the
discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using
the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Accrued  interest  payable  and  short-term  borrowings  - For these  short-term
instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Long-term debt and company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
- Rates  currently  available to the Corporation for debt with similar terms and
remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing borrowings.

Interest rate swap and cap agreements - The fair value of interest rate swap and
cap  agreements  is obtained  from dealer  quotes.  These values  represent  the
estimated  amount  the  Corporation  would  receive  or  pay  to  terminate  the
agreements,  taking into account current  interest rates and, when  appropriate,
the current creditworthiness of the counterparties.

Standby  letters  of  credit  - The fair  value of  standby  letters  of  credit
represent  deferred fees arising from the related  off-balance  sheet  financial
instruments. These deferred fees approximate the fair value of these instruments
and are based on several factors, including the remaining terms of the agreement
and the credit standing of the customer.

Commitments  to  originate  mortgage  loans  held for  sale - The fair  value of
commitments to originate  mortgage loans held for sale is estimated by comparing
the  Corporation's  cost to acquire  mortgages and the current price for similar
mortgage  loans,  taking  into  account  the  terms of the  commitments  and the
creditworthiness of the counterparties.

Forward  commitments  to sell  residential  mortgage  loans - The fair  value of
forward  commitments to sell residential  mortgage loans is the estimated amount
that the  Corporation  would  receive or pay to terminate  the forward  delivery
contract at the  reporting  date based on market  prices for  similar  financial
instruments.

Limitations - Fair value  estimates are made at a specific point in time,  based
on relevant market  information and information about the financial  instrument.
These  estimates  do not reflect any premium or discount  that could result from
offering for sale at one time the Corporation's  entire holdings of a particular
financial instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of the
Corporation's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments
regarding future expected loss experience,  current  economic  conditions,  risk
characteristics  of various  financial  instruments,  and other  factors.  These
estimates  are  subjective  in nature and involve  uncertainties  and matters of
significant  judgment  and,  therefore,  cannot be  determined  with  precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

NOTE 18 REGULATORY MATTERS:

Restrictions on Cash and Due From Banks

The Corporation's  bank subsidiaries are required to maintain certain vault cash
and reserve  balances  with the Federal  Reserve Bank to meet  specific  reserve
requirements. These requirements approximated $6.0 million at December 31, 2003.

Regulatory  Capital  Requirements

The  Corporation  and the  subsidiary  banks are  subject to various  regulatory
capital  requirements  administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to
meet minimum capital  requirements can initiate  certain  mandatory and possibly
additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if

                                       84
<PAGE>

undertaken,  could have a direct material effect on the Corporation's  financial
statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory  framework for
prompt corrective  action, the Corporation must meet specific capital guidelines
that involve quantitative measures of the Corporation's assets, liabilities, and
certain  off-balance  sheet  items as  calculated  under  regulatory  accounting
practices. The Corporation's capital amounts and classification are also subject
to qualitative  judgments by the regulators about  components,  risk weightings,
and other factors.

Quantitative  measures  established  by  regulation to ensure  capital  adequacy
require the Corporation to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the
table  below) of total and Tier I capital  (as  defined in the  regulations)  to
risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average
assets (as  defined).  Management  believes,  as of December 31, 2003,  that the
Corporation meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the most recent  notifications from the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
categorized  the  subsidiary  banks as well  capitalized  under  the  regulatory
framework for prompt  corrective  action. To be categorized as well capitalized,
the subsidiary banks must maintain minimum total risk-based,  Tier I risk-based,
and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or
events  since that  notification  that  management  believes  have  changed  the
institutions' category.

The actual capital  amounts and ratios of the  Corporation  and its  significant
subsidiaries  are  presented  below.  No  deductions  from capital were made for
interest rate risk in 2003 or 2002.

As discussed in Note 10, the preferred securities held by the ASBC Trust qualify
as Tier 1 Capital for the Corporation under Federal Reserve Board guidelines. As
a result of the  issuance  of FIN 46, the  Federal  Reserve  Board is  currently
evaluating   whether   deconsolidation   of  the  ASBC  Trust  will  affect  the
qualification of the preferred securities as Tier 1 capital. If it is determined
that the preferred securities no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, the effect of
such a change is not  expected  to  affect  the  Corporation's  well-capitalized
status.

NOTE 19 EARNINGS PER SHARE:

Basic  earnings per share is  calculated  by dividing net income by the weighted
average  number of common  shares  outstanding.  Diluted  earnings  per share is
calculated  by  dividing  net income by the  weighted  average  number of shares
adjusted for the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options.

On April 24, 2002, the Board of Directors declared a 10% stock dividend, payable
May 15 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 29. All share
and per share data in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements has
been adjusted to reflect the declaration of the 10% stock dividend.  As a result
of the stock dividend,  the Corporation  distributed  approximately  7.0 million
shares of common stock.  Any fractional  shares resulting from the dividend were
paid in cash.

NOTE 20 SEGMENT REPORTING

SFAS  No.  131,  "Disclosures  about  Segments  of  an  Enterprise  and  Related
Information,"  requires  selected  financial and descriptive  information  about
reportable  operating  segments.  The  statement  uses a  "management  approach"
concept  as the  basis  for  identifying  reportable  segments.  The  management
approach is based on the way that  management  organizes the segments within the
enterprise for making operating decisions,  allocating resources,  and assessing
performance.  Consequently,  the segments are evident from the  structure of the
enterprise's  internal  organization,  focusing on financial information that an
enterprise's  chief  operating  decision-makers  use to make decisions about the
enterprise's operating matters.

The  Corporation's  primary segment is banking,  conducted  through its bank and
lending  subsidiaries.  For purposes of segment disclosure under this statement,
these have been combined as one segment, as these segments have similar economic
characteristics  and  the  nature  of  their  products,   services,   processes,
customers,  delivery channels, and regulatory  environment are similar.  Banking
includes:  a) community  banking - lending and deposit  gathering to  businesses
(including  business-related  services such as cash management and international
banking  services) and to consumers  (including  mortgages and credit cards); b)
corporate banking - specialized lending (such as commercial real estate),  lease
financing,  and banking to larger businesses and metro or niche markets;  and c)
the support to deliver banking services.

The "Other"  segment is comprised  of wealth  management  (including  insurance,
brokerage, and trust/asset management), as well as intersegment eliminations and
residual  revenues and expenses,  representing  the  difference  between  actual
amounts incurred and the amounts allocated to operating segments.

                                       87

The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note
1. Selected segment information is presented below.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
ASSOCIATED BANC-CORP

The Board of Directors
Associated Banc-Corp:

We have  audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of  Associated
Banc-Corp  and  subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,  and the related
consolidated  statements of income,  changes in stockholders'  equity,  and cash
flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period ended  December 31, 2003.
These consolidated  financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Associated Banc-Corp
and  subsidiaries  as of December  31,  2003 and 2002,  and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period
ended  December 31, 2003 in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the Company
changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002.
