SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Forward-looking  statements  have been made in this  document,  and in documents
that are incorporated by reference, that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
These forward-looking statements describe future plans or strategies and include
Associated Banc-Corp's  expectations of future results of operations.  The words
"believes,"   "expects,"   "anticipates,"   or  similar   expressions   identify
forward-looking statements.

Shareholders  should  note  that  many  factors,  some of  which  are  discussed
elsewhere  in this  document  and in the  documents  that  are  incorporated  by
reference, could affect the future financial results of Associated Banc-Corp and
could  cause  those  results  to  differ  materially  from  those  expressed  in
forward-looking  statements  contained  or  incorporated  by  reference  in this
document. These factors include the following:

-    operating, legal, and regulatory risks;

-    economic,   political,   and  competitive   forces   affecting   Associated
     Banc-Corp's  banking,  securities,  asset  management,  and credit services
     businesses; and

-    the risk that  Associated  Banc-Corp's  analyses  of these risks and forces
     could be  incorrect  and/or that the  strategies  developed to address them
     could be unsuccessful.

These factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements,
and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Associated Banc-Corp
undertakes  no obligation  to update or revise any forward  looking  statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

                                     PART I

ITEM 1  BUSINESS

GENERAL

Associated  Banc-Corp (the  "Corporation") is a bank holding company  registered
pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act"). It was
incorporated  in Wisconsin in 1964 and was inactive  until 1969 when  permission
was  received  from the Board of  Governors  of the  Federal  Reserve  System to
acquire three banks. At December 31, 2000, the Corporation owned nine commercial
banks located in Illinois,  Minnesota,  and Wisconsin (the "affiliates") serving
their local communities and, measured by total assets held at December 31, 2000,
was  the  third  largest  commercial  bank  holding  company   headquartered  in
Wisconsin.   The  Corporation  also  owned  31  nonbanking   subsidiaries   (the
"subsidiaries") located in Arizona, California,  Illinois, Missouri, Nevada, and
Wisconsin.

Effective in the second quarter of 2001, the  Corporation  will merge all of the
Wisconsin bank affiliates into a single national banking charter,  headquartered
in Green Bay, Wisconsin,  under the name Associated Bank, National  Association.
Certain  subsidiaries will also merge with and into the resultant bank, becoming
departments  of the Wisconsin  national bank. At the completion of the foregoing
mergers,  the  Corporation  will have four  commercial  bank  affiliates  and 20
subsidiaries.

SERVICES

The Corporation  provides  advice and specialized  services to its affiliates in
banking   policy  and   operations,   including   auditing,   data   processing,
marketing/advertising,  investing,  legal/compliance,  personnel services, trust
services,  risk  management,   facilities  management,   security,   purchasing,
treasury, finance, accounting, and other financial services functionally related
to banking.

Responsibility   for  the  management  of  the  affiliates  remains  with  their
respective Boards of Directors and officers. Services rendered to the affiliates
by the  Corporation  are  intended  to  assist  the  local  management  of these
affiliates to expand the scope of services  offered by them.  Bank affiliates of
the Corporation at December 31, 2000, provided services through 214 locations in
149 communities.

The  Corporation,  through its affiliates,  provides a complete range of banking
services  to  individuals  and  businesses.  These  services  include  checking,
savings,  and money market deposit accounts,  business,  personal,

                                       3
<PAGE>

educational, residential, and commercial mortgage loans, other consumer-oriented
financial services, including IRA and Keogh accounts, and safe deposit and night
depository  facilities.  Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), which provide 24-hour
banking services to customers of the affiliates, are installed in many locations
in the  affiliates'  service areas.  The affiliates are members of an interstate
shared ATM network, which allows their customers to perform banking transactions
from their checking,  savings,  or credit card accounts at ATMs in a multi-state
environment.  Among  the  services  designed  specifically  to meet the needs of
businesses are various types of specialized financing, cash management services,
and transfer/collection facilities.

The affiliates  provide lending,  depository,  and related financial services to
individual,  commercial, industrial, financial, and governmental customers. Term
loans, revolving credit arrangements,  letters of credit, inventory and accounts
receivable  financing,  real  estate  construction  lending,  and  international
banking services are available.

Lending  involves credit risk.  Credit risk is controlled and monitored  through
active  asset  quality  management  and the use of lending  standards,  thorough
review of potential borrowers,  and active asset quality administration.  Active
asset quality  administration,  including early problem loan  identification and
timely resolution of problems,  further ensures appropriate management of credit
risk and  minimization  of loan losses.  The allowance for loan losses  ("AFLL")
represents  management's  estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable
losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  Management's  evaluation of the adequacy
of the AFLL is based on  management's  ongoing  review  and  grading of the loan
portfolio,  consideration of past loan loss  experience,  trends in past due and
nonperforming  loans, risk  characteristics  of the various  classifications  of
loans, current economic conditions, the fair value of underlying collateral, and
other factors which could affect potential credit losses. Credit risk management
is  discussed  under  sections   "Loans,"   "Allowance  for  Loan  Losses,"  and
"Nonperforming Loans,  Potential Problem Loans, and Other Real Estate Owned" and
under Notes 1 and 5 in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Additional  emphasis is given to noncredit  services for  commercial  customers,
such as advice and  assistance in the placement of  securities,  corporate  cash
management,   and  financial  planning.  The  affiliates  make  available  check
clearing, safekeeping, loan participations, lines of credit, portfolio analyses,
and other services to approximately 120 correspondent financial institutions.

A trust company subsidiary and an investment  management subsidiary offer a wide
variety of fiduciary,  investment  management,  advisory,  and corporate  agency
services to  individuals,  corporations,  charitable  trusts,  foundations,  and
institutional investors. They also administer (as trustee and in other fiduciary
and  representative  capacities)  pension,  profit  sharing  and other  employee
benefit plans, and personal trusts and estates.

Investment  subsidiaries  provide discount and full-service  brokerage services,
including  the  sale  of  fixed  and  variable  annuities,   mutual  funds,  and
securities,  to the  affiliates'  customers  and the general  public.  Insurance
subsidiaries  provide commercial and individual insurance services and engage in
reinsurance.  Various life, property,  casualty,  credit, and mortgage insurance
products are  available to the  affiliates'  customers  and the general  public.
Seven investment  subsidiaries  located in Nevada hold,  manage, and trade cash,
stocks, and securities  transferred from the affiliates and reinvest  investment
income.   Three  additional   investment   subsidiaries  formed  in  Nevada  and
headquartered  and domiciled in the Cayman Islands provide  investment  services
for their parent bank, as well as provide  management of their  respective  Real
Estate Investment Trust ("REIT")  subsidiaries.  A leasing  subsidiary  provides
lease financing for a variety of capital equipment for commerce and industry. An
appraisal  subsidiary provides real estate appraisals for customers,  government
agencies, and the general public.

The mortgage banking  subsidiaries  are involved in the origination,  servicing,
and warehousing of mortgage loans, and the sale of such loans to investors.  The
primary  focus  is  on  commercial  and  one-  to  four-family  residential  and
multi-family properties, which are generally salable into the secondary mortgage
market. The principal mortgage lending areas of these subsidiaries are Wisconsin
and  Illinois.  Nearly all  long-term,  fixed-rate  real estate  mortgage  loans
generated are sold in the secondary market and to other financial  institutions,
with the subsidiaries retaining the servicing of those loans.

                                       4
<PAGE>

In addition to real estate loans, the Corporation's  affiliates and subsidiaries
originate and/or service consumer loans, business credit card loans, and student
loans.  Consumer,  home equity,  and student lending  activities are principally
conducted in Wisconsin  and  Illinois,  while the credit card base and resulting
loans are  principally  centered in the Midwest.  In April 2000, the Corporation
entered into an agreement with Citibank USA ("Citi") for the  acquisition of the
Corporation's  retail  credit  card  portfolio.  That  agreement,  along  with a
five-year agency agreement entered into  contemporaneously  with Citi,  provides
for agent fees and other income on new and existing card business.

The  Corporation,  its  affiliates,  and  subsidiaries  are not dependent upon a
single or a few  customers,  the loss of which  would  have a  material  adverse
effect  on  the  Corporation.  No  material  portion  of  the  business  of  the
Corporation, its affiliates, or its subsidiaries is seasonal.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

The  Corporation,  its  affiliates,  and  subsidiaries  do  not  engage  in  any
operations in foreign  countries,  other than three investment  subsidiaries all
formed  under  the  General  Corporation  Law  of the  State  of  Nevada.  These
investment  subsidiaries are  headquartered  and  commercially  domiciled in the
Cayman  Islands.  Each subsidiary has at least one employee who is a resident of
the  Cayman  Islands.   In  addition,   Associated  Bank  Green  Bay,   National
Association, a banking affiliate of the Corporation, has established a branch in
the Cayman Islands under a Class B Banking  License issued by the Cayman Islands
Monetary Authority. It has at least one employee who is a resident of the Cayman
Islands.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2000, the Corporation,  its affiliates,  and subsidiaries,  as a
group, had 3,835 full-time equivalent employees.

COMPETITION

The financial services industry is highly competitive.  The Corporation competes
for loans, deposits, and financial services in all of its principal markets. The
Corporation  competes directly with other bank and nonbank  institutions located
within its markets,  with  out-of-market  banks and bank holding  companies that
advertise or otherwise serve the Corporation's  markets,  money market and other
mutual  funds,  brokerage  houses,  and various  other  financial  institutions.
Additionally,   the  Corporation  competes  with  insurance  companies,  leasing
companies, regulated small loan companies, credit unions, governmental agencies,
and  commercial  entities  offering  financial  services  products.  Competition
involves efforts to obtain new deposits, the scope and type of services offered,
interest  rates paid on deposits and charged on loans,  as well as other aspects
of banking.  All of the affiliates also face direct  competition from members of
bank holding  company  systems that have greater assets and resources than those
of the Corporation.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

Financial institutions are highly regulated both at the federal and state level.
Numerous  statutes  and  regulations   presently  affect  the  business  of  the
Corporation,  its  affiliates,  and  its  subsidiaries.  Proposed  comprehensive
statutory  and  regulatory  changes  could  have an effect on the  Corporation's
business.

As a registered  bank holding  company  under the Act, the  Corporation  and its
nonbanking  affiliates are regulated and supervised by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (the "Board"). The affiliates of the Corporation with
a national  charter  are  supervised  and  examined  by the  Comptroller  of the
Currency.  The  affiliates  with a state charter are  supervised and examined by
their respective  state banking agency,  and either the Board, if such affiliate
is a member of the Federal Reserve System,  or by the Federal Deposit  Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC"), if a nonmember. Currently, all affiliates with a state
charter are  nonmember  banks.  All  affiliates of the  Corporation  that accept
insured deposits are subject to examination by the FDIC.

                                       5
<PAGE>

The activities of the Corporation, its affiliates, and subsidiaries, are limited
by the Act to those activities that are banking or those  nonbanking  activities
that are closely  related or incidental to banking.  The Corporation is required
to act as a source of financial  strength to each of its affiliates  pursuant to
which  it  may be  required  to  commit  financial  resources  to  support  such
affiliates in circumstances when, absent such requirements,  it might not do so.
The Act also  requires the prior  approval of the Board for the  Corporation  to
acquire  direct or  indirect  control of more than five  percent of any class of
voting shares of any bank or bank holding company.  Further restrictions imposed
by the Act include  capital  requirements,  restrictions  on  transactions  with
affiliates, on issuances of securities, on dividend payments, on inter-affiliate
liabilities,  on  extensions  of credit,  and on  expansion  through  merger and
acquisition.

The  federal  regulatory   authorities  have  broad  authority  to  enforce  the
regulatory  requirements  imposed  on  the  Corporation,   its  affiliates,  and
subsidiaries.  In particular,  the Financial  Institutions Reform,  Recovery and
Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"),  and their implementing  regulations,  carry
greater enforcement  powers.  Under FIRREA, all commonly controlled FDIC insured
depository  institutions  may be held  liable for any loss  incurred by the FDIC
resulting  from a  failure  of,  or any  assistance  given by the  FDIC to,  any
commonly controlled  institutions.  Pursuant to certain provisions under FDICIA,
the federal  regulatory  agencies  have broad  powers to take prompt  corrective
action if a depository  institution  fails to maintain  certain  capital levels.
Prompt  corrective  action may include the inability of the  Corporation  to pay
dividends,  restrictions  in  acquisitions  or activities,  limitations on asset
growth, and other restrictions.

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 contains
provisions  which  amended  the  Act  to  allow  an  adequately-capitalized  and
adequately-managed  bank  holding  company to acquire a bank  located in another
state as of September 29, 1995. Effective June 1, 1997, interstate branching was
permitted. The Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997 clarifies the applicability of
host state laws to any branch in such state of an out-of-state bank.
The FDIC  maintains the Bank  Insurance  Fund (BIF) and the Savings  Association
Insurance Fund (SAIF) by assessing depository  institutions an insurance premium
twice a year.  The amount  each  institution  is  assessed  is based both on the
balance of insured  deposits held during the preceding two quarters,  as well as
on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund. FDIC assesses
higher  rates on those  institutions  that pose greater  risks to the  insurance
funds. Effective April 1, 2000, the FDIC Board of Directors (FDIC Board) adopted
revisions to the FDIC's regulation governing deposit insurance assessments which
it believes enhance the present system by allowing  institutions  with improving
capital  positions to benefit from the improvement  more quickly while requiring
those whose capital is failing to pay a higher  assessment  sooner.  The Federal
Deposit  Insurance  Act governs the  authority  of the FDIC Board to set BIF and
SAIF  assessment  rates and  directs the FDIC Board to  establish  a  risk-based
assessment system for insured depository institutions and set assessments to the
extent  necessary  to  maintain  the  reserve  ratio at 1.25%.  The  current BIF
assessment rate is 1.34% and the SAIF assessment rate is 1.44%.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, P.L. 106-102,  enacted on November 12, 1999,
has made major amendments to the Act. The amendments,  among other things, allow
certain  qualifying  bank  holding  companies to engage in  activities  that are
financial in nature and that  explicitly  include the  underwriting  and sale of
insurance.  The amendments also amend the Act provisions governing the scope and
manner of the Board's supervision of bank holding companies, the manner in which
activities may be found to be financial in nature, and the extent to which state
laws on  insurance  will  apply  to  insurance  activities  of  banks  and  bank
affiliates.  The Board has issued regulations implementing these provisions. The
amendments  allow for the expansion of activities by banking  organizations  and
permit consolidation among financial organizations generally.

The  laws  and  regulations  to  which  the  Corporation,  its  affiliates,  and
subsidiaries  are subject are constantly  under review by Congress,  the federal
regulatory agencies, and the state authorities. These laws and regulations could
be changed  drastically in the future,  which could affect the  profitability of
the Corporation,  its ability to compete effectively,  or the composition of the
financial services industry in which the Corporation competes.

GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES AND ECONOMIC CONTROLS

The  earnings  and growth of the  banking  industry  and the  affiliates  of the
Corporation  are  affected  by the  credit  policies  of  monetary  authorities,
including  the Federal  Reserve  System.  An  important  function of the Federal
Reserve  System is to regulate  the  national  supply of bank credit in order to
combat  recession and curb  inflationary  pressures.  Among the  instruments  of
monetary policy used by the Federal  Reserve to implement  these  objectives are
open  market  operations  in U.S.  government  securities,  changes  in  reserve
requirements  against member bank deposits,  and changes in the Federal  Reserve
discount rate. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall
growth of bank loans,  investments,  and deposits,  and may also affect interest
rates  charged  on loans or paid for  deposits.  The  monetary  policies  of the
Federal  Reserve  authorities  have had a  significant  effect on the  operating
results of  commercial  banks in the past and are  expected  to continue to have
such an effect in the future.

In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets,
as well as the effect of credit  policies  by monetary  and fiscal  authorities,
including the Federal Reserve  System,  no prediction can be made as to possible
future changes in interest  rates,  deposit  levels,  and loan demand,  or their
effect on the business and earnings of the Corporation and its affiliates.

ITEM 2  PROPERTIES

The  Corporation's  headquarters  were relocated to the Village of  Ashwaubenon,
Wisconsin,  in a leased facility with approximately 30,000 square feet of office
space in  September  1998.  The space is subject to a  five-year  lease with two
consecutive five-year extensions.

At December  31, 2000,  the  affiliates  occupied  214 offices in 149  different
communities  within  Illinois,  Minnesota,  and  Wisconsin.  All affiliate  main
offices are owned,  except  Associated Bank Milwaukee,  Associated Bank Chicago,
Associated  Bank Illinois,  and Associated  Bank  Minnesota.  The affiliate main
offices in downtown Milwaukee, Chicago, Rockford, and Minneapolis are located in
the lobbies of multi-story  office buildings.  Most affiliate branch offices are
free-standing  buildings  that  provide  adequate  customer  parking,  including
drive-in facilities of various numbers and types for customer convenience.  Some
affiliates also have branch offices in various supermarket locations, as well as
offices in retirement communities.  In addition, the Corporation owns other real
property  that,  when  considered  in  the  aggregate,  is not  material  to its
financial position.

ITEM 3  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

There are legal proceedings  pending against certain affiliates and subsidiaries
of the Corporation which arose in the normal course of their business.  Although
litigation  is subject to many  uncertainties  and the  ultimate  exposure  with
respect to these matters cannot be ascertained,  management believes, based upon
discussions with counsel, that the Corporation has meritorious defenses, and any
ultimate  liability would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position or results of operations of the Corporation.

ITEM 4  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

There were no matters  submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2000.

ITEM 7  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion is management's analysis to assist in the understanding
and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations
of Associated Banc-Corp (the "parent company"), together with its affiliates and
subsidiaries  (the  "Corporation").  It should be read in  conjunction  with the
consolidated  financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data
presented elsewhere in this report.

The  financial   discussion  that  follows  may  refer  to  the  impact  of  the
Corporation's  business combination  activity,  detailed under section "Business
Combinations," and Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The
detailed  financial  discussion  focuses  on  2000  results  compared  to  1999.
Discussion of 1999 results to 1998 is predominantly in section "1999 Compared to
1998."

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The  Corporation  recorded  net  income of  $168.0  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 2000,  an increase of $3.0 million or 1.8% over the $164.9  million
earned in 1999.  Basic  earnings per share for 2000 were $2.46,  a 4.2% increase
over 1999 basic  earnings per share of $2.36.  Earnings  per diluted  share were
$2.46, a 5.1% increase over 1999 diluted earnings per share of $2.34.  Return on
average  assets ("ROA") and return on average equity ("ROE") for 2000 were 1.31%
and 18.26%, respectively,  compared to 1.41% and 18.04%, respectively, for 1999.
Cash  dividends paid in 2000 increased by 5.0% to $1.11 per share over the $1.05
per share paid in 1999. Key factors behind these results were:

-    Taxable  equivalent net interest  income was $405.3 million for 2000,  $4.1
     million  or 1.0%  lower  than  1999.  Taxable  equivalent  interest  income
     increased  by $124.7  million,  while  interest  expense  increased  $128.8
     million.  The volume of average  earning  assets  increased $1.1 billion to
     $12.0 billion, which exceeded the $1.0 billion increase in interest-bearing
     liabilities.  Although  increases  in the  volume  of  earning  assets  and
     interest-bearing  liabilities,  as well as changes in  product  mix,  added
     $32.4  million  to  taxable  equivalent  net  interest  income,  changes in
     interest rates resulted in a $36.5 million decrease.

-    Net interest  income and net interest  margin were also impacted in 2000 by
     the rising interest rate environment, competitive pricing pressures, branch
     deposit and credit card receivable sales, and funding of stock repurchases.
     The Federal  Reserve raised  interest rates six times between July 1999 and
     December  2000,  producing an average  Federal funds rate for 2000 that was
     131 basis points ("bp") higher than the average for 1999.

-    The net interest  margin was 3.36% for 2000, a 38 bp decline from 3.74% for
     1999, the net result of the 45 bp decrease in interest rate spread,  offset
     by a 7 bp  improvement  in  the  net  free  funds  contribution.  Rates  on
     interest-bearing  liabilities  in 2000  were 80 bp higher  than last  year,
     while the yield on earning  assets  increased 35 bp,  bringing the interest
     rate spread down by 45 bp.

-    Total loans were $8.9  billion at December  31,  2000,  an increase of $570
     million or 6.8% over December 31, 1999,  predominantly in commercial loans.
     Excluding the sale of $128 million of credit card loan receivables in 2000,
     total loans were 8.4% higher at year-end  2000 than a year  earlier.  Total
     deposits were $9.3 billion at December 31, 2000,  $600 million  higher than
     December 31, 1999,  despite the sale of six Illinois branch offices in 2000
     with  deposits  totaling  $109  million.  The growth was  predominantly  in
     brokered CDs.

-    Asset quality  remained  relatively  strong.  The provision for loan losses
     ("PFLL")  increased to $20.2 million compared to $19.2 million in 1999. Net
     charge-offs ("NCOs") decreased $4.8 million, primarily due to fewer NCOs on
     credit cards between the years,  given the sale of credit card  receivables
     in April 2000.  NCOs were 0.10% of average loans compared to 0.18% in 1999.
     The  ratio of  allowance  for loan  losses  to loans was 1.35% and 1.36% at
     December 31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.  Nonperforming  loans were $47.7
     million,  representing  0.54% of total loans at year-end 2000,  compared to
     $36.9 million or 0.44% of total loans last year.

-    Noninterest  income was $184.2  million  for 2000,  $18.3  million or 11.0%
     higher  than  1999.  Net  gains  on the  sales  of  assets  and  investment
     securities  totaled  $16.8  million in 2000  compared  to net gains of $8.0
     million in 1999.  Key sales in 2000  included a $12.9  million  gain on the
     sale of the credit card  receivables,  the $11.1 million net premium on the
     sales of deposits of six branches,  and $7.6 million net losses on the sale
     of  investment  securities.  Excluding  these  asset  and  security  sales,
     noninterest  income was $167.4 million,  or $9.5 million (6.0%) higher than
     1999.  With the  exception  of mortgage  banking,  which was  impacted by a
     year-over-year  slowdown  in  secondary  mortgage  production,   all  other
     noninterest income categories collectively increased $20.0 million or 15.7%
     in 2000 compared to 1999.

-    Noninterest expense was $317.7 million, up $12.6 million or 4.1% over 1999.
     However,  1999  expenses  were  reduced by two large items  totaling  $12.0
     million, namely the reversal of mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") valuation
     allowance and a reduction in profit sharing  expense.  Not including  these
     items,  noninterest  expense was  relatively  unchanged (up $0.6 million or
     0.2%),  despite adding $10.9 million of  incremental  expenses in 2000 from
     the 1999 purchase acquisitions.  Excluding the acquisitions, as well as the
     two 1999 items noted above,  noninterest  expense was $10.3 million  (3.4%)
     lower than 1999.

-    Income tax expense  decreased  to $61.8  million,  down $10.5  million from
     1999.  The effective tax rate in 2000 was 26.9% compared to 30.5% for 1999,
     due to the tax benefits of  additional  municipal  securities,  real estate
     investment trusts,  bank owned life insurance,  and tax valuation allowance
     adjustments.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

There were no  completed or pending  business  combination  transactions  during
2000. During 1999, the Corporation acquired $591 million in assets through three
acquisition transactions.  All were accounted for under the purchase method, and
therefore the  financial  position and results of operations of each entity were
included in the consolidated financial statements as of the consummation date of
each transaction.  The Corporation's  business  combination  activity is further
summarized in Note 2 of the notes to consolidated  financial  statements.  Share
repurchase  activity  related to the acquisitions is described under the section
"Capital."

INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest  income is the primary  source of the  Corporation's  revenue.  Net
interest  income is the  difference  between  interest  income on earning assets
("EAs"),   such  as  loans  and   securities,   and  the  interest   expense  on
interest-bearing  deposits  and other  borrowings,  used to fund those and other
assets or activities.  The amount of net interest  income is affected by changes
in interest rates and by the amount and composition of EAs and  interest-bearing
liabilities  ("IBLs").  Additionally,  net  interest  income is  impacted by the
sensitivity  of the balance sheet to changes in interest  rates which factors in
characteristics   such  as  the  fixed  or  variable  nature  of  the  financial
instruments, contractual maturities, and repricing frequencies.

Net interest income in the consolidated statements of income (which excludes the
taxable equivalent adjustment on tax exempt assets) was $383.6 million, compared
to $395.7 million last year. The taxable equivalent adjustments (the adjustments
to bring  tax-exempt  interest  to a level that would  yield the same  after-tax
income had that income been subject to taxation,  using a 35% tax rate) of $21.7
million  for 2000  and  $13.7  million  for  1999,  resulted  in  fully  taxable
equivalent  ("FTE") net interest  income of $405.3  million and $409.4  million,
respectively.  The $8.0 million  increase in the taxable  equivalent  adjustment
between  years was in line with the 52% growth in average  municipal  securities
balances.  The impact of carrying more tax exempt assets in 2000 is reflected in
the  consolidated  statements  of income as a  reduction  to income tax  expense
between the years.

FTE net interest  income was $405.3 million for 2000, a decrease of $4.1 million
or 1.0%  from  1999.  The  1999  acquisitions,  net of the  cost  to fund  them,
contributed  approximately  $15 million more net interest income in 2000 than in
1999. For 2000 compared to 1999, the decrease in FTE net interest income was due
to the  combination  of a number of factors,  including a rising  interest  rate
environment,  an  inverted  yield  curve  during

                                       13
<PAGE>

the  year,  funding  of stock  repurchases,  greater  average  bank  owned  life
insurance  ("BOLI")  balances,  the sale of  branch  deposits  and  credit  card
receivables,  and  continued  competitive  pressures  for both loan and  deposit
products.

Interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain
changes in net interest income.  Interest rate spread is the difference  between
the  yield on EAs and the rate paid for IBLs that  fund  those  assets.  The net
interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average
EAs.  The  net  interest   margin  exceeds  the  interest  rate  spread  because
noninterest-bearing  sources  of funds  (net  free  funds),  principally  demand
deposits and stockholders' equity, also support EAs. To compare tax-exempt asset
yields to  taxable  yields,  the yield on  tax-exempt  loans and  securities  is
computed on an FTE basis.  Net interest  income,  interest rate spread,  and net
interest margin are discussed further on an FTE basis.

Table 2 provides  average  balances  of EAs and IBLs,  the  associated  interest
income and expense,  and the  corresponding  interest  rates earned and paid, as
well as net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin on an
FTE  basis for the three  years  ended  December  31,  2000.  Tables 3 through 5
present  additional  information  to facilitate the review and discussion of FTE
net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin.

As  indicated  in Tables 2 and 3,  increases in volume and changes in the mix of
both EAs and IBLs  added  $32.4  million  to FTE net  interest  income,  whereas
changes in the rates resulted in a $36.5 million decline,  for a net decrease of
$4.1 million.

The net interest margin for 2000 was 3.36%, compared to 3.74% in 1999. For 2000,
the  yield on EAs rose 35 basis  points,  increasing  interest  earned  by $35.8
million (with loans  accounting  for $28.1 million of the  increase),  while the
cost of IBLs  increased 80 bp, raising  interest  expense by $72.3 million (with
interest-bearing  deposits,  principally  brokered  CDs,  accounting  for  $46.3
million),  for a net decline of $36.5  million in FTE net interest  income.  The
decline  in net  interest  margin was  unfavorably  impacted  by tighter  credit
spreads in increasingly competitive markets and by increased reliance of funding
loan growth with market-rate sensitive liabilities in a rising rate environment,
particularly  wholesale funding. In addition, the lower margin reflects the cost
of funding the Corporation's share repurchases during 2000 and funding more BOLI
(an asset whose  earnings are  recorded as fee income),  as well as the sales of
branch deposits (replaced with  higher-costing  wholesale funds) and the sale of
higher-yielding credit card receivables. While these actions negatively impacted
the  margin,  they  supported  other  corporate  objectives,   such  as  capital
management, revenue diversity, and streamlining strategies.

In  combination,  the  growth  and  composition  change  of EAs  contributed  an
additional  $88.9  million  to FTE net  interest  income,  while the  growth and
composition of IBLs cost an additional  $56.5  million,  netting a $32.4 million
increase to FTE net interest income.

Average EAs were $12.0 billion in 2000,  an increase of $1.1 billion,  or 10.0%,
from 1999. On average, the acquisitions  contributed  approximately $275 million
to this increase,  while the sale of the credit card receivables reduced average
EAs by approximately $96 million. Loans accounted for the majority of the growth
in EAs,  increasing to 72.1% of average EAs, compared to 71.2% for 1999. Average
loans were $8.7 billion in 2000,  up $887 million or 11.4%  compared to 1999 (up
9.8%  excluding  the net impact  from  acquisitions  and the sale of credit card
receivables).  During 2000, the Corporation  focused on shifting the composition
of its loan  portfolio,  growing  the  proportion  of  commercial  loans,  which
represented  36% of average EAs for 2000 compared to 31% for 1999. For 2000, FTE
interest  income on loans  increased  $101.7 million over last year,  with $73.5
million  contributed  from loan  growth  and $28.2  million  added from the rate
environment  impact on loans (See Table 3). The average  loan yield for 2000 was
8.38%,  up 35 bp over last year.  The loan yield lagged the change in the market
rate in part due to repricing frequencies in the portfolio,  competitive pricing
pressures  on new  production,  the  sale of the  higher  yielding  credit  card
receivables,  and other loan mix changes. The increase seen in investment yields
was primarily a result of the rising rate environment.

Average  IBLs were $10.7  billion in 2000,  an increase of $1.0 billion or 10.5%
from  1999.   Although  the   Corporation  has  been  successful  in  attracting
transactional  demand deposit  accounts,  loan growth  outpaced

                                       14
<PAGE>

deposit growth,  increasing the Corporation's reliance on brokered CDs and other
wholesale  funding  sources.  The mix of IBLs shifted from  lower-rate  deposits
(which represented 75.1% of average IBLs for 2000 compared to 79.0% for 1999) to
higher-cost  wholesale  funding.  Average  interest-bearing  deposits  were $8.0
billion in 2000, up $388 million or 5.1% compared to 1999 (up 5.0% excluding the
net impact from  acquisitions  and branch  deposit  sales).  For 2000,  interest
expense on interest-bearing deposits increased $65.8 million, with $19.5 million
contributed from the growth in volume and $46.3 million added from the impact of
the rate environment.  Brokered CDs were the predominant driver of the change in
interest-bearing  deposits,  up $599  million  on average  over last  year,  and
costing 112 bp more in 2000 than 1999.  Total  wholesale  funds  (including  all
funding  sources  other than  interest-bearing  deposits)  were $2.7  billion on
average for 2000, up $622 million or 30.6%. Total interest-bearing deposits cost
4.74% on average for 2000 (62 bp more than last year),  while wholesale  funding
on a combined basis cost 6.32% (117 bp higher than last year).

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES

The PFLL in 2000 was $20.2 million.  In comparison,  the PFLL for 1999 was $19.2
million, and $14.7 million for 1998. The PFLL is predominantly a function of the
methodology  used to  determine  the adequacy of the  allowance  for loan losses
which  focuses  on  changes  in the size and  character  of the loan  portfolio,
changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming  loans,  historical losses
on each portfolio category, the risk inherent in specific loans,  concentrations
of loans to specific borrowers or industries,  existing economic conditions, the
fair value of  underlying  collateral,  and other  factors  which  could  affect
potential  credit  losses.  The ratio of the  allowance for loan losses to total
loans was 1.35%,  down slightly  from 1.36% at December 31, 1999,  and down from
1.37% at December 31, 1998. See additional discussion under section,  "Allowance
for Loan Losses."

NONINTEREST INCOME

Noninterest  income was $184.2  million for 2000,  $18.3 million or 11.0% higher
than 1999. Of the $18.3 million  increase,  $8.8 million was from  increased net
gains on asset and investment sales. Thus, excluding asset and investment sales,
noninterest  income was 6.0% higher than last year,  despite a dramatic decrease
in mortgage banking income as discussed below. Excluding mortgage banking income
and the net gains on asset and investment sales, noninterest income increased by
$20.0  million  or 15.7% in 2000,  of which  the 1999  acquisitions  contributed
approximately  $2.8  million.  Fee  income  as a  percentage  of total  revenues
(defined  as total  noninterest  income  less  gains  or  losses  on  asset  and
investment  sales ("fee  income")  divided by taxable  equivalent  net  interest
income plus fee income) was 29.2% for 2000 compared to 27.8% last year.

</TABLE>

Trust  service  fees for 2000 were $37.6  million,  down 1% from last year.  The
change was  predominantly  due to a decrease in the market value of assets under
management, a function of the declines in the stock and bond markets during 2000
compared  to  1999,  and  competitive  market  conditions.  Trust  assets  under
management  totaled $4.6 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Service charges on deposits were $33.3 million, $3.7 million (12.5%) higher than
1999 due to mid-year  rate  increases  and  initiatives  to reduce the volume of
service charges waived.

Mortgage  banking income consists of servicing fees, the gain or loss on sale of
mortgage  loans  to  the  secondary  market,  and   production-related   revenue
(origination, underwriting, and escrow waiver fees). Mortgage banking income was
$19.9  million in 2000,  a  decrease  of $10.5  million or 34.4% from 1999.  The
decrease  was  driven  primarily  by a  61%  drop  in  secondary  mortgage  loan
production in response to the rising interest rate  environment in 2000 compared
to 1999.  The  lower  production  levels  adversely  impacted  gains on sales of
mortgages  (down $8.1 million or 72%) and volume related fees (down $2.2 million
or 56%).  The portfolio of loans  serviced for others was  relatively  unchanged
($5.5 billion at December 31, 2000, down 1% from $5.6 billion at year-end 1999),
directly affecting servicing fees which were $14.9 million, down $0.2 million or
1% between the years.

Credit card and other  nondeposit  fees were $25.7 million for 2000, an increase
of $5.0  million or 24.0% over 1999,  with $1.6  million in  increased  merchant
income, $2.8 million in all other credit card revenue, and $0.6 million in other
nondeposit charges. The other credit card revenue was enhanced by the April 2000
acquisition  agreement and five-year agency agreement with Citibank USA ("Citi")
which provide for agent fees and other income on new and existing card business.

Retail  commission  income  (which  includes   commissions  from  insurance  and
brokerage product sales) was $20.2 million,  up $1.8 million or 9.9% compared to
last year. The increase was led by higher insurance  revenue,  particularly from
fixed annuities and credit life production.

Asset sale gains for 2000 were $24.4  million,  including the $12.9 million gain
recognized on the sale of $128 million  credit card  receivables to Citi and the
$11.1  million  net premium on the sales of $109  million in

                                       19
<PAGE>

deposits from six branches during 2000. Asset sale gains in 1999 of $5.0 million
were  primarily  attributable  to the net premium on deposits of three  branches
sold in the fourth quarter of 1999.

BOLI income was $12.4 million,  up $2.9 million or 30.9% over last year, in line
with  the 20%  increase  in the  average  base  investment  and  rate  increases
effective  in the first  quarter  of 2000.  Other  noninterest  income was $18.3
million for 2000, up $7.0 million from 1999. The increase  included $1.5 million
recognized in connection with an interim  servicing  agreement with Citi related
to the credit card  receivable  sale,  and $3.6 million in  connection  with the
Corporation's  mid-2000  change in data  processing and  management  information
system vendors,  both of which compensated for certain additional costs incurred
by the Corporation.

Investment  securities  losses for 2000 were $7.6  million.  The net losses were
primarily from various  securities  sold and the proceeds  either  reinvested to
mitigate interest rate risk and enhance future yields or to pay down higher cost
borrowings.  Investment  securities gains for 1999 were $3.0 million,  primarily
due to a $3.6  million  gain on the  partial  sale of an  agency  security  that
carried  an other  than  temporary  impairment  amount  reported  in  1997.  The
remaining portion of this security was sold during 2000 for a $1.5 million loss.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Total noninterest  expense ("NIE") for 2000 was $317.7 million,  a $12.6 million
or 4.1% increase over 1999 NIE. However, 1999 expenses were reduced by two large
items  totaling  $12.0  million  (the $8.0  million  reversal  of MSR  valuation
allowance and a $4.0 million reduction in profit sharing expense). Not including
these items, NIE was relatively  unchanged between the years (up $0.6 million or
0.2%),  despite adding  approximately  $10.9 million of incremental  expenses in
2000 from the 1999 purchase  acquisitions.  Excluding the acquisitions,  and the
two noted  items  from  1999,  NIE  decreased  $10.3  million or 3.4% over 1999.
Primary categories impacting the change between 2000 and 1999 are noted below.

Personnel  expense  increased  $5.4 million or 3.5% over 1999,  and  represented
49.4% of total NIE in 2000 compared to 49.7% in 1999.  Salary expenses  remained
level,  increasing  only  $0.8  million  or 0.6%  in  2000,  principally  due to
operational efficiencies. Merit increases between the years were offset by fewer
full-time  equivalent  employees  ("FTEs") and lower  temporary  contract labor.
Average  FTEs of 3,909  during  2000 were  down 128 or 3.2% from the 4,037  FTEs
during 1999.  FTEs were reduced  throughout  the year  primarily in  operational
areas as  centralization  of processes and other  operational-related  synergies
were achieved.  Fringe  benefits  increased $4.6 million in 2000,  primarily the
result of a $4.0 million  increase in profit  sharing  expense.

                                       20
<PAGE>

Rising costs of health,  dental, and life insurance coverages were nearly offset
by  reductions  in other fringe  benefits (up $0.6 million or 2.1% on a combined
basis).

Occupancy and equipment  expense on a combined basis was $38.5 million for 2000,
essentially  unchanged from last year. Data processing  costs increased to $22.4
million, up $680,000 or 3.1% over last year, attributable to increased costs for
software and system enhancements  during 2000,  partially offset by lower credit
card processing costs given the credit card  receivables sale in 2000.  Business
development and advertising increased to $13.4 million for 2000, up $1.4 million
compared to 1999, primarily in television advertising for a branding campaign in
2000.

FDIC expense  decreased to $1.8 million,  down $1.5 million,  reflecting the net
rate  reduction in the combined BIF and SAIF  effective  for 2000 on a minimally
changed deposit base.  Amortization of MSRs includes the amortization of the MSR
asset and increases or decreases to the valuation allowance  associated with the
MSR asset. Amortization of MSRs increased by $7.7 million between 2000 and 1999,
predominantly  driven by the  recovery of an $8.0 million  valuation  adjustment
during  1999  (see Note 6 of the notes to  consolidated  financial  statements).
Intangible  amortization was $8.9 million, up due to a full year of amortization
during 2000 on the intangibles added from the 1999 purchase acquisitions.  Legal
and professional fees were down $456,000 compared to last year, primarily due to
Y2K consulting costs not recurring in 2000.

Other  expense was $50.8 million for 2000,  down $1.2 million  compared to 1999,
most directly attributable to lower loan expenses (down $1.2 million and in line
with lower  mortgage  loan  production  in 2000 and lower  credit card  expenses
following the sale of the credit card receivables in April 2000).

INCOME TAXES

Income tax  expense for 2000 was $61.8  million,  down $10.5  million  from 1999
income tax  expense  of $72.4  million.  The  Corporation's  effective  tax rate
(income tax expense  divided by income  before taxes) was 26.9% in 2000 compared
to 30.5%  in  1999.  This  decrease  was  attributable  to the tax  benefits  of
increased municipal  securities  (average balances of municipal  securities were
52% higher than 1999), increased BOLI income, real estate investment trusts, and
tax valuation allowance adjustments.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

LOANS

Total loans were $8.9 billion at December 31, 2000,  an increase of $570 million
or 6.8% over December 31, 1999, predominantly in commercial loans. Excluding the
sale of $128 million of credit card  receivables  in the second quarter of 2000,
total loans were 8.4% higher at year-end 2000 than a year ago.  Commercial loans
were $4.6 billion, up $721 million or 18.5%.  Commercial loans grew to represent
52% of total loans at the end of 2000,  up from 47% at year-end  1999.  Changing
the mix of loans to include more  commercial  loans  continued to be a strategic
initiative during 2000.

</TABLE>

Commercial,  financial,  and agricultural  loans were $1.7 billion at the end of
2000, up $245 million or 17.3% since  year-end  1999, and comprised 19% of total
loans  outstanding,  up from 17% at the end of 1999. The commercial,  financial,
and agricultural loan  classification  primarily consists of commercial loans to
middle market companies and small businesses.  Loans of this type are in a broad
range of  industries.  The credit risk  related to  commercial  loans is largely
influenced  by  general  economic  conditions  and  the  resulting  impact  on a
borrower's  operations.  Within  the  commercial,  financial,  and  agricultural
classification  at December 31, 2000, loans to finance  agricultural  production
totaled $19.6 million or 0.2% of total loans.

Real  estate  construction  loans grew $100  million  or 17.9% to $661  million,
representing 7% of the total loan portfolio at the end of 2000, compared to $560
million or 7% at the end of 1999.  Loans in this  classification  are  primarily
short-term   interim  loans  that  provide  financing  for  the  acquisition  or
development of commercial real estate,  such as multi-family or other commercial
development projects.  Real estate construction loans are made to developers and
project  managers who are well known to the  Corporation,  have prior successful
project  experience,  and are well  capitalized.  Projects  undertaken  by these
developers  are carefully  reviewed by the  Corporation  to ensure that they are
economically  viable. Loans of this type are primarily made in the Corporation's
tri-state market in which the Corporation has a thorough  knowledge of the local
market economy.  The credit risk associated with real estate  construction loans
is generally confined to specific geographic areas. The Corporation controls the
credit  risk on these  types of loans by making  loans in  familiar  markets  to
developers,  underwriting  the loans to meet the  requirements of  institutional
investors in the secondary market,  reviewing the merits of individual projects,
controlling  loan structure,  and monitoring  project  progress and construction
advances.

Commercial  real  estate   includes  loans  secured  by  farmland,   multifamily
properties, and nonfarm/nonresidential  real estate properties.  Commercial real
estate  totaled $2.3 billion at December 31, 2000, up $384 million or 20.2% over
last year and  comprised 26% of total loans  outstanding  versus 23% at year-end
1999. Commercial real estate loans involve borrower  characteristics  similar to
those  discussed  above  for  commercial  loans  and  real   estate-construction
projects.  Loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial properties,
multi-family properties,  community purpose properties,  and similar properties.
Loans are primarily  made to borrowers in Wisconsin,  Illinois,  and  Minnesota.
Credit risk is managed in a similar  manner to commercial  loans and real estate
construction by employing sound underwriting guidelines, lending to borrowers in
known markets and businesses,  and formally  reviewing the borrower's  financial
soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis.

Residential  mortgage  loans  totaled  $3.7 billion at the end of 2000 and 1999.
Loans in this classification  include residential real estate, which consists of
conventional   home  mortgages,   home  equity  lines,  and  second   mortgages.
Residential  real estate  loans  generally  limit the maximum loan to 75%-80% of
collateral  value.  Residential  real estate loans were $3.2 billion at December
31, 2000,  down $116 million or 3.5% compared to

                                       22
<PAGE>

last year,  principally  due to lower  production  as a result of a higher  rate
environment in 2000 compared to 1999 and strong price  competition.  Home equity
lines grew by $100  million,  or 24.6%,  to $509 million in 2000, in response to
promotional efforts in 2000.

</TABLE>

Consumer  loans to individuals  totaled $625 million at December 31, 2000,  down
$135 million or 17.8% compared to 1999,  with $128 million of retail credit card
receivables sold in April 2000. Installment loans include short-term installment
loans, direct and indirect automobile loans,  recreational vehicle loans, credit
card loans (which are  primarily  business-oriented  since the April 2000 sale),
student loans, and other personal loans. Individual borrowers may be required to
provide  related  collateral  or a  satisfactory  endorsement  or guaranty  from
another person,  depending on the specific type of loan and the creditworthiness
of the  borrower.  Credit  risk for these  types of loans is  generally  greatly
influenced by general economic  conditions,  the  characteristics  of individual
borrowers,  and the  nature of the loan  collateral.  Credit  risk is  primarily
controlled by reviewing the  creditworthiness of the borrowers as well as taking
appropriate collateral and guaranty positions on such loans.

An active credit risk management  process is used for commercial loans to ensure
that sound and consistent  credit decisions are made.  Credit risk is controlled
by detailed  underwriting  procedures,  comprehensive loan  administration,  and
periodic  review  of  borrowers'  outstanding  loans and  commitments.  Borrower
relationships are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis for early identification
of potential problems.  Further analyses by customer,  industry,  and geographic
location  are  performed  to  monitor   trends,   financial   performance,   and
concentrations.

Factors  that are  critical to managing  overall  credit  quality are sound loan
underwriting  and  administration,  systematic  monitoring of existing loans and
commitments,  effective loan review on an ongoing basis, early identification of
potential problems,  an adequate allowance for loan losses, and sound nonaccrual
and charge-off policies.

The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups,
and market areas.  Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a
financial  institution  when  there are  amounts  loaned to  numerous  borrowers
engaged in similar  activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by
economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2000, no concentrations existed in

The  investment  and loan  portfolios  are the  Corporation's  primary  interest
earning assets. While the investment portfolio is structured with minimum credit
exposure to the Corporation,  the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to
credit risk.  Credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending
standards,  thorough review of potential borrowers,  and on-going review of loan
payment  performance.  Active  asset  quality

administration,   including  early  problem  loan   identification   and  timely
resolution of problems,  further ensures  appropriate  management of credit risk
and  minimization  of loan losses.  Credit risk management for each loan type is
discussed briefly in the section entitled "Loans."

At December 31, 2000, the allowance for loan losses ("AFLL") was $120.2 million,
compared to $113.2 million at December 31, 1999.  The $7.0 million  increase was
the net  result  of $20.2  million  provision  for loan  losses,  offset by $9.0
million of NCOs and a $4.2 million  decrease  related to the sale of credit card
receivables  in the second quarter of 2000. As of December 31, 2000, the AFLL to
total loans was 1.35% and covered 252% of nonperforming loans, compared to 1.36%
and  307%,  respectively,  at  December  31,  1999.  Tables  10 and  11  provide
additional  information  regarding  activity  in the AFLL and Table 12  provides
additional information regarding nonperforming loans.

</TABLE>

The AFLL represents  management's  estimate of an amount adequate to provide for
probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.
Management's  evaluation  of the  adequacy of the AFLL is based on  management's
ongoing  review and grading of the loan  portfolio,  consideration  of past loan
loss   experience,   trends   in  past  due  and   nonperforming   loans,   risk
characteristics  of the  various  classifications  of loans,  existing  economic
conditions,  the fair value of  underlying  collateral,  and other factors which
could affect potential credit losses.

In  general,  the  change  in the AFLL is a  function  of a number  of  factors,
including but not limited to changes in the loan  portfolio  (see Table 8), NCOs
(see Table 10), and nonperforming loans (see Table 12). First, total loan growth
from  year-end  1999 to 2000  was up 6.8% (or 8.4%  when  factoring  in the $128
million of credit card  receivables  sold during 2000). The growth was strongest
in the commercial portfolio  (particularly  commercial real estate;  commercial,
financial,  and agricultural  loans; and  construction  loans),  which grew

                                       24
<PAGE>

$721 million or 18.5% to represent  52% of total loans at year-end 2000 compared
to 47% last  year-end.  This  segment  of the  loan  portfolio  carries  greater
inherent credit risk (described under section "Loans"). While NCOs for 2000 have
decreased  $4.8 million to $9.0  million,  the decline is due to having sold the
credit card  receivables  and thus,  no longer  incurring  related  charge-offs.
Excluding NCOs on credit cards, NCOs would be relatively  unchanged between 1999
and 2000.  Finally,  nonperforming  loans to total  loans grew to 0.54% for 2000
compared to 0.44% last year.

The  allocation  of the  Corporation's  AFLL for the last five years is shown in
Table 11. The allocation  methodology  applied by the  Corporation,  designed to
assess the adequacy of the AFLL, focuses on changes in the size and character of
the loan portfolio, changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans,
the risk  inherent  in  specific  loans,  concentrations  of  loans to  specific
borrowers or industries,  existing economic conditions, and historical losses on
each portfolio category. Because each of the criteria used is subject to change,
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical  purposes
and is not  necessarily  indicative  of the trend of future  loan  losses in any
particular loan category. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from
any segment of the  portfolio.  Management  continues to target and maintain the
AFLL  equal  to the  allocation  methodology  plus an  unallocated  portion,  as
determined by economic conditions on the Corporation's  borrowers. For both 1999
and 1998, estimation methods and assumptions included consideration of Year 2000
issues on significant customers. Management allocates the AFLL for credit losses
by pools  of risk.  The  business  loan  (commercial  real  estate;  commercial,
financial, and agricultural; leases; and real estate construction) allocation is
based on a quarterly review of individual loans, loan types, and industries. The
retail loan  (residential  mortgage,  home equity,  and consumer)  allocation is
based on  analysis of  historical  delinquency  and  charge-off  statistics  and
trends.  Minimum  loss  factors  used by the  Corporation  for  criticized  loan
categories are  consistent  with  regulatory  agency  factors.  Loss factors for
non-criticized  loan  categories  are based  primarily on  historical  loan loss
experience and peer group statistics.  The mechanism used to address differences
between  estimated  and actual loan loss  experience  includes  review of recent
nonperforming loan trends, underwriting trends, and external factors.

The  allocation  methods  used for  December  31,  2000 and 1999 were  generally
comparable.  For 2000,  the  amount  allocated  to  commercial,  financial,  and
agricultural loans increased, representing 38% of the AFLL, compared to 28% last
year. The increase was a function of changes in the commercial,  financial,  and
agricultural  loans  category,  including:  a greater  amount of these  loans in
criticized loan categories and for which specific allocations were made for 2000
compared to 1999;  increased  loan  balances,  growing to represent 19% of total
loans at  year-end  2000  versus  17%  last  year;  and  more of these  loans in
nonperforming loan categories at year-end 2000 versus last year (28% versus 16%,
respectively).  For 2000, the amount  allocated to consumer  loans  decreased to
represent 5% of the AFLL versus 13% for 1999. This decrease was  predominantly a
function of the sale of $128 million of credit card receivables in mid-2000. For
1999 compared to 1998, the allocation for credit card loans was reduced based on
delinquencies   and  charge-offs   trending  below  national  averages  and  the
maturation  of the  portfolio,  which  indicated  lower  risk of  loss,  and the
allocation   factor  for  commercial   real  estate  loans   (included  in  real
estate-mortgage) was increased given the increased risk associated with a rising
interest rate environment on this loan category.

Management  believes  the  AFLL to be  adequate  at  December  31,  2000.  While
management  uses  available  information  to recognize  losses on loans,  future
adjustments to the AFLL may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions
and the impact of such  change on the  Corporation's  borrowers.  As an integral
part of their examination  process,  various regulatory agencies also review the
AFLL.  Such  agencies may require that  changes in the AFLL be  recognized  when
their  credit  evaluations  differ  from  those  of  management,  based on their
judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.

The PFLL in 2000 was $20.2 million.  In comparison,  the PFLL for 1999 was $19.2
million and $14.7 million in 1998.

NCOs were $9.0  million or 0.10% of average  loans for 2000,  compared  to $13.7
million or 0.18% of average  loans for 1999,  and were $11.4 million or 0.16% of
average loans for 1998. The $4.8 million  decrease in NCOs was primarily  driven
by lower charge-offs of consumer loans in 2000 versus 1999 (down $5.2 million as
shown in Table 10). This decline is predominantly  due to having sold the retail
credit  card  receivables  in  2000  and,  thus,  no  longer  incurring  related
charge-offs.  Excluding  NCOs on credit cards,  NCOs would have been  relatively
unchanged  between 1999 and 2000.  Loans  charged off are subject to  continuous
review, and specific efforts are taken to achieve maximum recovery of principal,
accrued interest, and related expenses.

NONPERFORMING LOANS, POTENTIAL PROBLEM LOANS, AND OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED

Management   is  committed  to  an  aggressive   nonaccrual   and  problem  loan
identification  philosophy.  This  philosophy  is  embodied  through the ongoing
monitoring  and  reviewing of all pools of risk in the loan  portfolio to ensure
that all problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized.

Nonperforming  loans are defined as nonaccrual loans, loans 90 days or more past
due but still accruing,  and restructured  loans.  The Corporation  specifically
excludes from its definition of  nonperforming  loans student loan balances that
are 90 days or more  past  due and  still  accruing  and that  have  contractual
government guarantees as to collection of principal and interest.  Such past due
student loans were approximately $19.5 million and $16.9 million at December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when  contractually  past due 90
days  or more as to  interest  or  principal  payments.  Additionally,  whenever
management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the
collectibility of principal or interest on loans, it is management's practice to
place such loans on  nonaccrual  status  immediately,  rather than delaying such
action  until  the  loans  become  90 days  past  due.  Previously  accrued  and
uncollected  interest on such loans is  reversed,  amortization  of related loan
fees is  suspended,  and income is  recorded  only to the extent  that  interest
payments are  subsequently  received in cash and a  determination  has been made
that the principal balance of the loan is collectible.  If collectibility of the
principal is in doubt, payments received are applied to loan principal.

Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing  interest are also included in
nonperforming  loans.  Loans  past due 90 days or more but  still  accruing  are
classified  as such  where  the  underlying  loans are both  well  secured  (the
collateral  value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued  interest) and in
the  process  of   collection.   Also  included  in   nonperforming   loans  are
"restructured" loans. Restructured loans involve the granting of some concession
to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan, such as changes
in payment schedule or interest rate.

Nonperforming  loans at December 31, 2000,  were $47.7  million,  an increase of
$10.8 million from December 31, 1999. The ratio of nonperforming  loans to total
loans at the end of 2000 was 0.54%,  as  compared to 0.44% and 0.74% at December
31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.  Nonaccrual loans accounted for $9.0 million of
the increase in nonperforming loans.  Commercial  nonaccrual loans (representing
approximately  67% of  nonaccrual  loans at year-end 2000 versus 44% at year-end
1999) increased $13.5 million,  predominantly due to the addition of three large
commercial  credits (totaling  approximately  $12.8 million).  The Corporation's
AFLL to  nonperforming  loans  was 252% at  year-end  2000,  down  from  307% at
year-end 1999 and up from 185% at year-end 1998.

The following table shows,  for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual  basis
and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated, the gross interest that
would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance  with their
original  terms and the amount of interest  income that was included in interest
income for the period.

Potential  problem  loans are loans  where there are doubts as to the ability of
the borrower to comply with present  repayment terms. The decision of management
to  place  loans  in this  category  does  not  necessarily  indicate  that  the
Corporation  expects  losses to occur,  but that  management  recognizes  that a
higher degree of risk is associated with these performing loans.

At December 31, 2000,  potential problem loans totaled $137.8 million. The loans
that have been  reported as potential  problem loans are not  concentrated  in a
particular industry, but rather cover a diverse range of businesses.  Management
does not  presently  expect  significant  losses from  credits in the  potential
problem loan category.

Other real estate owned ("OREO") increased to $4.0 million at December 31, 2000,
compared  to  $3.7  million  and  $6.0  million  at  year-end   1999  and  1998,
respectively.  Net gains on sales of OREO were $116,000,  $403,000, and $426,000
for 2000,  1999,  and 1998,  respectively.  Management  actively seeks to ensure
properties held are monitored to minimize the Corporation's risk of loss.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO

The investment  securities portfolio is intended to provide the Corporation with
adequate liquidity,  flexibility in asset/liability  management, and a source of
stable income.  Investment securities classified as held to maturity ("HTM") are
carried in the  consolidated  balance sheet at amortized  cost while  investment
securities  classified  as available for sale ("AFS") are carried at fair market
value.  At December 31, 2000, the total carrying value of investment  securities
represented  25% of total assets,  compared to 26% at year-end 1999. On average,
the investment portfolio represented 28% of average earning assets for both 2000
and 1999.

At December 31, 2000 and 1999, mortgage-related securities represented 49.7% and
53.5%, respectively, of total investment securities based on amortized cost. The
fair value of  mortgage-related  securities  are subject to inherent risks based
upon the future performance of the underlying  collateral (i.e.  mortgage loans)
for these  securities,  such as prepayment  risk and interest rate changes.  Tax
exempt securities grew to represent 26.8% of total securities based on amortized
cost,  compared  to 20.4% at  year-end  1999,  due to higher  comparable  yields
combined with tax advantages and additional call protection.

The aggregate  fair value of total  securities was  approximately  $3.26 billion
(100.1% of  carrying  value) and $3.27  billion  (100.0% of  carrying  value) at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

At December 31, 2000,  the  Corporation's  securities  portfolio did not contain
securities,  other than U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, of any single issuer
that were  payable  from and  secured  by the same  source of  revenue or taxing
authority where the aggregate carrying value of such securities  exceeded 10% of
stockholders' equity or $96.9 million.

The  classification  of  securities  as HTM or AFS is  determined at the time of
purchase.  Beginning in 1998, the Corporation  began to classify most investment
purchases  as  AFS.  This  is  consistent  with  the  Corporation's   investment
philosophy  of  maintaining  flexibility  to manage  the  investment  portfolio,
particularly  in  light  of  asset/liability  management  strategies,  including
possible securities sales in response to changes in interest

                                       28

rates or  prepayment  risk,  the need to manage  regulatory  capital,  and other
factors.  Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"),
"Accounting  for  Derivative  Investments  and  Hedging  Activities,"  which was
adopted by the  Corporation  as  required on January 1, 2001,  provides  for the
option,  upon adoption,  to change the classification of investments held. Thus,
effective January 1, 2001, the Corporation elected to reclassify all of the $369
million of HTM investments to the AFS classification. SFAS No. 133 is more fully
described under the section "Accounting Developments."

DEPOSITS

Deposits are the  Corporation's  largest source of funds.  At December 31, 2000,
deposits were $9.3 billion, up $600 million or 6.9% over last year, primarily in
brokered  certificates  of deposit  ("CDs") (up $579  million).  Total  deposits
excluding  brokered  CDs  ("retail  deposits")  were  essentially  flat  between
year-end  periods.  The sale of deposits of six branches  during 2000  decreased
deposits by $109 million.  Thus, without the branch sales,  retail deposits were
up $130 million or 1.6% over year-end 1999.

One of the primary factors  influencing the Corporation's  retail deposit growth
has been  competitive  pressure from other  financial  institutions,  as well as
other  investment  opportunities  available  to  customers.   During  2000,  the
Corporation  particularly  marketed  its  money  market  accounts,  which  offer
competitive rates and greater customer  flexibility,  as well as business demand
deposits.

                                       29
<PAGE>

On average,  deposits  were $9.1 billion for 2000,  up $471 million or 5.5% over
the average for 1999. However,  excluding the increase in brokered CDs, deposits
were down 1.5%. As previously mentioned under section "Net Interest Income," the
decline in average deposits, excluding brokered CDs, increased the Corporation's
reliance on  wholesale  funding,  as  discussed  under  section " Other  Funding
Sources."

Table  16  summarizes  the   distribution  of  average   deposits.   A  maturity
distribution  of certificates of deposits and other time deposits of $100,000 or
more at December 31, 2000, is shown in Table 17.

OTHER FUNDING SOURCES

Other funding sources,  including both long-term debt and short-term  borrowings
("wholesale  funds"),  were $2.7 billion at December 31, 2000,  down $79 million
from $2.8 billion at December 31, 1999. Long-term debt at December 31, 2000, was
$122.4  million,  up from $24.3 million at the end of last year.  See Note 10 of
the notes to  consolidated  financial  statements for additional  information on
long-term debt.  Short-term  borrowings are primarily comprised of Federal funds
purchased,  securities sold under agreements to repurchase,  short-term  Federal
Home Loan Bank ("FHLB")  advances,  notes payable to banks,  treasury,  tax, and
loan notes ("TT&L  notes"),  and  commercial  paper.  Of note, the FHLB advances
included in short-term  borrowings  are those with  original  maturities of less
than one year and callable  notes that have  one-year  call  premiums  which the
Corporation expects may be called,  even if the notes have maturities  exceeding
one year. The TT&L notes are demand notes  representing  secured borrowings from
the U.S. Treasury,  collateralized by qualifying securities and loans. The funds
are placed with the subsidiary banks at the discretion of the U.S.  Treasury and
may be  called at any time.  See Note 9 of the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements for additional information on short-term borrowings, and Table 18 for
specific disclosure required for major short-term borrowing categories.

Wholesale  funds on average were $2.7 billion for 2000, up $622 million or 30.6%
over 1999. The reliance on wholesale  funds  increased  during 2000 as mentioned
under both sections "Net Interest  Income" and  "Deposits." The mix of wholesale
funding shifted slightly toward longer-term instruments,  with average

                                       30
<PAGE>

long-term  debt  representing  4.3% of wholesale  funds from 1.2% last year,  in
response to certain asset/liability objectives.  Within the short-term borrowing
categories, average Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements
to repurchase were up $667 million.

LIQUIDITY

Effective liquidity  management ensures the cash flow requirements of depositors
and borrowers, as well as the operating cash needs of the Corporation, are met.

Funds  are  available  from  a  number  of  sources,  including  the  securities
portfolio,  the core deposit base, lines of credit with major banks, the ability
to acquire large and brokered deposits, and the ability to securitize or package
loans for sale.  Additionally,  liquidity is provided from loans and  securities
repayments and maturities.

During 2000,  the four  largest  subsidiary  banks  (Associated  Bank  Illinois,
National  Association,  Associated  Bank  Milwaukee,  Associated Bank Green Bay,
National Association, and Associated Bank North) established a $2.0 billion bank
note program.  Under this program,  short-term and long-term debt may be issued.
As of December 31, 2000, there was $2.0 billion available under this program.

The parent company's primary funding sources to meet its liquidity  requirements
are dividends and service fees from  subsidiaries,  borrowings with major banks,
commercial paper issuance,  and proceeds from the issuance of equity. The parent
company  manages its  liquidity  position to provide the funds  necessary to pay
dividends to  stockholders,  service debt,  invest in  subsidiaries,  repurchase
common stock, and satisfy other operating  requirements.  Dividends  received in
cash from  subsidiaries  totaled  $168.2 million in 2000 and represent a primary
funding source.  At December 31, 2000, $148.5 million in dividends could be paid
to the  parent  by its  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  without  obtaining  prior
regulatory  approval,  subject to the capital needs of the banks.  Additionally,
the  parent  company  had $200  million  of  established  lines of  credit  with
nonaffiliated  banks,  of which $83.7  million was  outstanding  at December 31,
2000.  During 2000, a $200 million  commercial  paper program was initiated,  of
which $34.3 million was outstanding at December 31, 2000.

As discussed in Item 1 of Form 10-K,  subsidiary banks are subject to regulation
and,  among other  things,  may be limited in their  ability to pay dividends or
transfer funds to the parent company.  Accordingly,  consolidated  cash flows as
presented in the  Consolidated  Statements of Cash Flows may not represent  cash
immediately  available  for the payment of cash  dividends to the  Corporation's
stockholders.

Maintaining  adequate credit ratings on debt issues is important to liquidity as
it affects the ability of the  Corporation to attract funds from various sources
on a cost-competitive  basis. The parent company and its four largest subsidiary
banks had the following agency ratings:

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest  rates,  exchange rates,
commodity prices,  and other relevant market rate or price risk. The Corporation
faces market risk in the form of interest  rate risk through  other than trading
activities.  Market  risk from  other  than  trading  activities  in the form of
interest  rate risk is  measured  and managed  through a number of methods.  The
Corporation uses financial modeling  techniques which measure the sensitivity of
future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk.
Policies established by the Corporation's Asset/Liability Committee and approved
by the  Corporation's  Board of  Directors  limit  exposure of earnings at risk.
General  interest  rate  movements  are  used  to  develop  sensitivity,  as the
Corporation  feels it has no primary  exposure to a specific  point on the yield
curve.  These  limits  are  based  on  the  Corporation's  exposure  to a 100 bp
immediate and sustained parallel rate move, either upward or downward.

INTEREST RATE RISK

In order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates, the Corporation uses
two different measurement tools: static gap analysis and simulation of earnings.
The static gap  analysis  starts  with  contractual  repricing  information  for
assets,  liabilities,  and off-balance sheet  instruments.  These items are then
combined with repricing  estimations  for  administered  rate  (interest-bearing
demand  deposits,  savings,  and money market  accounts)  and  non-rate  related
products  (demand  deposit  accounts,  other assets,  and other  liabilities) to
create a baseline  repricing  balance  sheet.  In  addition  to the  contractual
information,  residential  mortgage  whole  loan  products  and  mortgage-backed
securities  are adjusted based on industry  estimates of prepayment  speeds that
capture the expected  prepayment of principal above the contractual amount based
on how far away the contractual coupon is from market coupon rates.

     accounts,  money  market  accounts,  and  interest-bearing  demand  deposit
     accounts  are  based  on  current  and  historical   experiences  regarding
     portfolio  retention and interest rate repricing  behavior.  Based on these
     experiences,  a portion of these balances is considered to be long-term and
     fairly stable and is therefore included in the "Over 1 Year" category.

The  static  gap  analysis  in  Table  20  provides  a  representation   of  the
Corporation's  earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It is a static
indicator which does not reflect various repricing  characteristics  and may not
necessarily  indicate  the  sensitivity  of net  interest  income in a  changing
interest rate environment.

Interest  rate  risk of  embedded  positions,  including  prepayment  and  early
withdrawal  options,  lagged interest rate changes,  administered  interest rate
products,  and cap and floor  options,  within  products  require a more dynamic
measuring tool to capture earnings risk. Earnings simulation is used to create a
more complete assessment of interest rate risk.

Along  with the static  gap  analysis,  determining  the  sensitivity  of future
earnings to a  hypothetical  plus or minus 100 and 200 basis point parallel rate
shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling. In addition to
the assumptions used to create the static gap,  simulation of earnings  includes
the  modeling  of the  balance  sheet  as an  ongoing  entity.  Future  business
assumptions  involving  administered rate products,  prepayments for future rate
sensitive balances,  and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are
included. These items are then modeled to project income based on a hypothetical
change in interest rates.  The resulting net income for the next 12-month period
is  compared  to the  net  income  amount  calculated  using  flat  rates.  This
difference represents the Corporation's  earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus
100 basis point parallel rate shock.

The resulting simulations for December 31, 2000, projected that net income would
decrease by approximately  5.5% of stable-rate net income if rates rose by a 100
basis point shock, and projected that net income would increase by approximately
4.1% if rates fell by a 100 basis point shock.  At December  31,  1999,  the 100
basis point shock up was  projected to decrease net income by 6.6%,  and the 100
basis point shock down  projected  that net income would  increase by 5.9%.  The
projected changes for both 2000 and 1999 were within the Corporation's  interest
rate risk policy.  According to the earnings simulation model, the Corporation's
sensitivity  to interest  rate changes  decreased  during  2000.  In response to
higher  rates in the  first  half of 2000,  the  Corporation's  sensitivity  was
decreased through the use of intermediate term borrowings.

These results are based solely on immediate and  sustained  parallel  changes in
market  rates and do not reflect the  earnings  sensitivity  that may arise from
other  factors,  such as changes in the shape of the yield curve,  the change in
spread between key market rates, or accounting  recognition of the impairment of
certain  intangibles.  The above results are also  considered to be conservative
estimates due to the fact that no management action to mitigate potential income
variances are included within the simulation process. This action could include,
but would not be limited to,  delaying an increase in deposit  rates,  extending
liabilities, hedging, changing the pricing characteristics of loans, or changing
the growth rate of certain assets and liabilities.

CAPITAL

Stockholders' equity at December 31, 2000, increased to $968.7 million or $14.65
per share,  compared with $909.8 million or $13.09 per share at the end of 1999.
Stockholders' equity is also described in Note 11, Stockholders'  Equity, of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The increase in stockholders' equity in 2000 was primarily composed of retention
of  earnings  and  the  exercise  of  stock  options.  Offsetting  increases  to
stockholders'  equity were the  payment of cash  dividends  and the  purchase of
treasury stock.  Additionally,  stockholders' equity at year-end 2000 included a
$15.6 million  equity  component  (included in accumulated  other  comprehensive
income)  related to unrealized  gains on securities  AFS, net of the tax effect,
predominately  due to the impact of the rate  environment  at the end of 2000 on
that  portfolio.  At December  31, 1999,  stockholders'  equity  included  $38.8
million  related to unrealized  losses on securities AFS, net of the tax effect.
Stockholders' equity to assets at December 31, 2000 was 7.38%, compared to 7.27%
at the end of 1999.  Excluding the unrealized  gains (losses) on securities AFS,
net of the tax effect,  stockholders'  equity to assets would be 7.27% and 7.55%
at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The adequacy of the Corporation's  capital is regularly  reviewed to ensure that
sufficient  capital  is  available  for  current  and  future  needs  and  is in
compliance  with  regulatory  guidelines.  The  assessment  of  overall  capital
adequacy  depends on a variety of factors,  including asset quality,  liquidity,
stability  of  earnings,  changing  competitive  forces,  economic  condition in
markets served, and strength of management.

As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the  Corporation's  Tier 1 risk-based  capital
ratios, total risk-based capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) ratios, and Tier 1 leverage
ratios were in excess of regulatory  requirements.  It is management's intent to
exceed the minimum requisite capital levels. Capital ratios are included in Note
17, Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The  Corporation's  Board of  Directors  ("BOD") has  authorized  management  to
repurchase shares of the Corporation's  common stock each quarter in the market,
to be made available for issuance in connection with the Corporation's  employee
incentive  plans  and for  other  corporate  purposes.  The BOD  authorized  the
repurchase of up to 1.3 million shares  (330,000 shares per quarter) in 2000 and
1999. Of these authorizations, approximately 418,000 shares were repurchased for
$10.6 million during 2000 (with 322,000 shares reissued in connection with stock
options  exercised),  and 429,000 shares were  repurchased  for $13.6 million in
1999 (with 277,000 shares reissued for 1999 options  exercised).  In March 2000,
the BOD also  authorized  the  repurchase  and  cancellation  of up to 5% of the
Corporation's  outstanding  shares,  not to  exceed  approximately  3.5  million
shares.  Under this authorization  through December 31, 2000, 3.3 million shares
were  repurchased  and retired at a cost of $81.9 million.  In October 2000, the
BOD  authorized the  repurchase  and  cancellation  of an additional 3.2 million
shares.  The repurchase of shares under this  authorization is expected to begin
after  repurchases  under  the  March  2000  authorization  are  completed.  The
repurchase  of shares  will be based on market  opportunities,  capital  levels,
growth prospects, and other investment opportunities.

In connection with specific 1999 and 1998 purchase acquisition transactions, the
BOD authorized  the  repurchase  and  retirement of shares issued.  During 1999,
approximately  3,061,000  shares  were  repurchased  and  2,764,000  shares were
retired in connection with the Windsor and Riverside purchase acquisitions, with
the difference  being reissued in connection with the consummation of Riverside.
In 1998,  approximately  990,000 shares were repurchased and 493,000 shares were
retired in  connection  with the  Citizens  and Windsor  acquisitions,  with the
difference  being reissued in connection with the February 1999  consummation of
Windsor.

Shares repurchased and not retired are held as treasury stock and,  accordingly,
are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders' equity.

Management  believes  that a  strong  capital  position  is  necessary  to  take
advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion,  and
to provide  depositor  and  investor  confidence.  Management  actively  reviews
capital  strategies for the Corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of
perceived business risks, future growth opportunities,  industry standards,  and
regulatory  requirements.  It is  management's  intent to  maintain  an  optimal
capital and leverage mix for growth and for shareholder return.

FOURTH QUARTER 2000 RESULTS

Net income for fourth  quarter  2000  ("4Q00") was $39.7  million,  $4.6 million
lower than the $44.3 million earned in the fourth quarter of 1999 ("4Q99").  ROE
was 16.95%, 210 bp lower than 4Q99, while ROA decreased 21 bp to 1.21%.

FTE net interest  income for 4Q00 was $100.2  million,  $5.8 million  lower than
4Q99.  Factors impacting net interest income and net interest margin include the
higher interest rate  environment  between the comparable  quarters,  as well as
competitive pricing pressures,  branch deposit and credit card receivable sales,
and funding of stock  repurchases.  The $5.8  million  decrease in net  interest
income was a function of a 45 bp decline in net interest  margin,  which reduced
net interest income by approximately $13.5 million, offset by approximately $7.7
million of  additional  net  interest  income due to  balance  sheet  growth and
changes in the mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For 4Q00,
net interest  margin was 3.20%  compared to 3.65% in 4Q99. The average Fed funds
rate of 6.50% in 4Q00 was 113 bp higher than the  comparable  quarter last year.
The yield on earning assets, which are slower to reprice, rose 39 bp to 7.96% in
4Q00. The rate on interest-bearing

                                       35
<PAGE>

liabilities,  on the other hand,  increased 94 bp to 5.39% due to more  frequent
repricing of deposit  products,  and wholesale funds. The net result was a 55 bp
decline in interest  rate spread.  The decline in spread was offset in part by a
10 bp improvement in net free funds  contribution.  Average earning asset growth
(up $746 million to $12.3  billion) and decreases in  interest-bearing  deposits
excluding   brokered  CDs  (down  $206   million)   were  funded   primarily  by
higher-costing  brokered  CDs  and  other  wholesale  funds  (together  up  $897
million).

The provision for loan losses of $5.2 million in 4Q00 was down $0.5 million from
4Q99, as less was provided due to the sale of credit card balances in the second
quarter of 2000,  but offset by additional  provision made for the strong growth
in commercial  real estate and other  commercial  loans  between the  comparable
quarters.

Noninterest  income in 4Q00 was $2.0 million higher than the comparable  quarter
in 1999.  4Q99  included  net gains of $2.8  million  on the sale of assets  and
investment  securities  (due primarily to the sale of three branch  locations in
4Q99),  whereas losses of $0.5 million were recorded in 4Q00  (principally  from
sales of  investment  securities).  Excluding  these  gains and losses from both
periods,  noninterest  income rose $5.3 million or 13.6%.  Credit card and other
nondeposit fees were up $1.0 million,  due to increases in merchant  interchange
income and other credit card revenue.  Service charges on deposit  accounts were
up $0.7 million,  due primarily to mid-2000 rate  increases.  Other  noninterest
income was up $4.2 million,  attributable principally to $3.6 million recognized
in connection with the Corporation's mid-2000 change in data processing vendors,
which  compensated  for certain  additional  costs incurred by the  Corporation.
Trust service fees declined $1.2 million, predominantly due to the impact of the
year-over-year  change in market  conditions on the market value of assets under
management.  The remaining noninterest income categories  collectively increased
$0.6 million or 4% over the same period last year.

Noninterest  expense  between  the  comparable  quarters  was  impacted  by  two
significant  items:  4Q99  included a $2.3  million MSR  valuation  reversal and
profit  sharing  expense was $2.2  million  higher in 4Q00 than 4Q99.  Excluding
these  items,  noninterest  expense was $2.3  million  (2.9%) lower in 4Q00 than
4Q99,  reflecting the continued focus on expense control in 2000. Decreases were
seen in numerous expense items. Income tax expense was down $2.7 million between
the  fourth  quarters  due to lower  income  before  tax and a  decrease  in the
effective tax rate, at 27.3% for 4Q00 compared to 28.3% for 4Q99.

OUTLOOK FOR 2001

The following  should be read in  conjunction  with the "Special Note  Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements" section noted on page 3.

The Corporation currently estimates the first quarter of 2001 earnings per share
to be modestly  higher than 4Q00  levels.  The  Corporation  expects  additional
improvements in each subsequent 2001 quarter,  resulting in diluted earnings per
share  for  2001 of $2.60 to  $2.65.  These  expectations  assume  decreases  in
interest  rates and stable asset  quality.  The  Corporation  expects  continued
strong  commercial loan growth,  modest deposit growth,  and expanding  margins.
Revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%, excluding asset sales. Noninterest
expense should continue to be well-controlled, with only modest increases.

1999 COMPARED TO 1998

The  Corporation  recorded  net  income of  $164.9  million  for the year  ended
December 31, 1999,  an increase of $7.9 million or 5.0% over the $157.0  million
earned in 1998.  Basic  earnings per share were $2.36, a 4.4% increase over 1998
basic earnings per share of $2.26. Earnings per diluted share were $2.34, a 4.5%
increase over 1998 diluted earnings per share of $2.24. Return on average assets
and return on average  equity were 1.41% and 18.04% for 1999,  compared to 1.48%
and 18.33%,  respectively,  for 1998.  Cash  dividends paid in 1999 increased by
10.5% to $1.05 per share  over the $0.95  per share  paid in 1998.  Key  factors
behind these results were:

                                       37
<PAGE>

Taxable  equivalent  net interest  income was $409.4  million for 1999, up $28.0
million or 7.3% over 1998. Taxable equivalent interest income increased by $35.7
million,  while interest expense  increased $7.7 million.  The volume of average
earning assets  increased  $892.6  million to $11.0 billion,  which exceeded the
$870.0 million increase in interest-bearing liabilities. Increases in volume and
changes in product mix added $35.0  million to taxable  equivalent  net interest
income,  whereas  changes in the rate  environment  resulted  in a $7.0  million
decline.

The net interest  margin,  net taxable  equivalent  interest  income  divided by
average  interest-earning  assets, was 3.74% for 1999, a 5 bp decline from 3.79%
in 1998. The  contribution  from net free funds decreased 8 bp, offset by a 3 bp
increase  in interest  spread,  or the  difference  between the yield on earning
assets  and the rate on IBLs,  to 3.23% for 1999.  The yield on  earning  assets
declined  32 bp to 7.56%,  while the rate on IBLs  decreased  35 bp to 4.33% for
1999, reflecting the year-over-year change in the interest rate environment. For
1999,  the average prime rate of 8.00% was 35 bp lower than 1998 and the average
fed funds rate of 4.95% was 41 bp lower than the prior year.

Total loans and deposits  were $8.3 billion and $8.7 billion,  respectively,  at
December 31, 1999, compared to $7.3 billion and $8.6 billion,  respectively,  at
December 31, 1998. These increases were from internal growth and acquisitions.

Provision for loan losses  increased to $19.2 million  compared to $14.7 million
in  1998.  Net  charge-offs  increased  $2.3  million,  primarily  due to  lower
recoveries  in 1999 than in 1998,  and were 0.18% of average  loans  compared to
0.16% in 1998.  The ratio of AFLL to loans was 1.36% and 1.37% at  December  31,
1999  and  1998,   respectively.   Nonperforming   loans  were  $36.9   million,
representing  0.44% of total loans at year-end 1999,  compared to $53.9 million,
or 0.74% of total loans last year.

Noninterest  income was $165.9 million for 1999, $2.0 million or 1.2% lower than
1998. A primary  component  impacting this decline was mortgage  banking income,
down $15.7  million  in 1999  versus  1998,  driven  primarily  by a 46% drop in
secondary  mortgage  loan  production  (particularly  refinancing  activity)  in
response to the rising interest rate environment in 1999 compared to 1998. Gains
on the sale of assets and investment securities were $6.0 million lower than the
$14.0 million recorded in 1998.  Excluding  mortgage banking income and gains on
asset and investment  securities  sales,  noninterest  income increased by $19.7
million or 18.2% in 1999, with increases in most other categories.

Noninterest  expense  increased $10.1 million or 3.4% over 1998. Most categories
of  noninterest  expense  increased due to the  acquisitions,  which added $16.7
million.   Partially  offsetting  the  increases  were  lower  expenses  in  MSR
amortization (which decreased $12.2 million,  principally due to lower valuation
reserves  during 1999) and  professional  fees (down $2.6 million from 1998, due
principally to the completion of Year 2000 consultant work in mid-1999).  Salary
expenses  increased  $5.5  million  or  4.6%  in  1999,  principally  due to the
acquisitions  and base  merit  increases  between  the  years.  Fringe  benefits
decreased  $2.3 million in 1999,  the net result of a $7.7 million  reduction in
profit sharing expense offset in part by rising costs of health,  dental,  life,
and other fringe benefits (up $5.4 million or 25.6%).

Income tax expense decreased to $72.4 million,  down $3.6 million from 1998. The
1999  effective tax rate was 30.5% or 210 bp lower than the 32.6% rate for 1998,
due  primarily to the tax benefit of  increased  municipal  securities  and BOLI
revenue, and the use of tax loss carryforwards.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On January 24,  2001,  the BOD  declared a $0.29 per share  dividend  payable on
February 15, 2001, to shareholders of record as of February 1, 2001.

A continuing  strategic  objective of the Corporation has been to streamline and
simplify the  Corporation.  This has included review of the branch  distribution
network  (and  certain   branch  sales  during  1999  and  2000),   as  well  as
centralization  of  functional  and  operational  processes.  As  part  of  this
objective,  the  Corporation  will  reduce  the  number  of legal  subsidiaries,
including  consolidating certain bank charters,  particularly the Wisconsin bank
charters, under a single national bank charter. It is anticipated that this plan
will be completed during the second quarter of 2001.

These subsequent events have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as
amended by SFAS No. 137,  "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133," and SFAS
No. 138,  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments  and Certain Hedging
Activities,"  (collectively referred to as "SFAS No. 133" or as the "statement")
requires derivative  instruments,  including derivative  instruments embedded in
other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet. The statement
continues to allow derivative  instruments to be used to hedge various risks and
sets forth specific  criteria to be used to determine when hedge  accounting can
be used.  For fair value  hedges,  the statement  also  provides for  offsetting
changes in fair value of both the  derivative  and the hedged asset or liability
to be recognized in earnings in the same period.  For cash flow hedges, the fair
value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income, to the extent
it is  effective.  Any  changes  in fair value or cash flow that  represent  the
ineffective  portion of a hedge are  required to be  recognized  in earnings and
cannot be deferred.  For  derivative  instruments  not  accounted for as hedges,
changes in fair value are required to be recognized in earnings.

The Corporation adopted the provisions of the statement, as required,  beginning
January 1, 2001. The predominant  activities  affected by the statement  include
the  Corporation's  use of  interest  rate swaps and  certain  mortgage  banking
activities.  The  interest  rate  swaps  disclosed  in Note 14 of the  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  were  redesignated  on January 1, 2001, and
qualify  for  hedge  accounting.   In  addition,  the  Corporation  enters  into
commitments to sell groups of  residential  mortgage loans that it originates or
purchases as part of its mortgage  banking  business,  as well as commitments to
originate  loans.  Both the  commitments to sell, as well as the  commitments to
originate  loans, are considered  derivatives  under SFAS No. 133, and beginning
January 1, 2001, are carried at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in
fair value  recognized in earnings.  Further,  as allowed by the statement,  the
Corporation  transferred  all HTM  investment  securities  to the AFS  category,
effective  January 1, 2001.  Given the derivatives  existing at January 1, 2001,
the impact of adopting the  provisions of this statement was not material to the
Corporation's financial position or results of operations.

The FASB continues to issue interpretive guidance which could require changes in
the  Corporation's  application of the standard or adjustments to the transition
amounts.  SFAS  No.  133,  as  applied  to  the  Corporation's  risk  management
strategies,  may  increase or  decrease  reported  net income and  stockholders'
equity  prospectively,  depending on future  levels of interest  rates and other
variables affecting the fair values of derivative  instruments and hedged items,
but will have no effect on cash flows or economic risk.

SFAS No. 140,  "Accounting  for Transfers and Servicing of Financial  Assets and
Extinguishments  of  Liabilities,"   replaces  SFAS  No.  125,  "Accounting  for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,"
and rescinds SFAS No. 127, "Deferral of the Effective Date of Certain Provisions
of SFAS No.  125." The  statement  revises  the  standards  for  accounting  for
securitizations  and other  transfers of financial  assets and requires  certain
disclosures,  but it also  carries over most of the  provisions  of SFAS No. 125
without modification.  The statement provides accounting and reporting standards
for  transfers  and  servicing  of  financial  assets  and   extinguishments  of
liabilities  based on the  application of a financial  components  approach that
focuses on control.  It is effective for transactions  occurring after March 31,
2001. Certain  disclosures about  securitizations  are effective on December 31,
2000. The adoption is not expected to be material to the Corporation's financial
position or results of operations.

                              ASSOCIATED BANC-CORP
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The  accounting  and  reporting  policies of Associated  Banc-Corp  (the "parent
company"),  together with its affiliates and subsidiaries  (the  "Corporation"),
conform to  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United  States of
America and to general  practice  within the financial  services  industry.  The
following is a description of the more significant of those policies.

BUSINESS

The Corporation  provides a full range of banking and related financial services
to individual  and corporate  customers  through its network of bank and nonbank
affiliates.  The Corporation is subject to competition  from other financial and
non-financial   institutions  that  offer  similar  or  competing  products  and
services. The Corporation is regulated by federal and state banking agencies and
undergoes periodic examinations by those agencies.

BASIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Corporation
and subsidiaries,  all of which are wholly-owned.  All significant  intercompany
balances and  transactions  have been  eliminated in  consolidation.  Results of
operations of companies  purchased  are included  from the date of  acquisition.
Certain amounts in the 1999 and 1998 consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the 2000 presentation.

In preparing the consolidated  financial  statements,  management is required to
make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and
liabilities  as of the date of the balance  sheet and  revenues and expenses for
the period.  Actual  results could differ  significantly  from those  estimates.
Estimates that are  particularly  susceptible to significant  change include the
determination  of the  allowance  for loan losses,  income  taxes,  and mortgage
servicing rights.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

Securities  are  classified  as held to  maturity  ("HTM"),  available  for sale
("AFS"),  or trading at the time of purchase.  In 2000 and 1999,  all securities
purchased were classified as AFS. Investment securities classified as HTM, which
management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported
at amortized  cost,  adjusted  for  amortization  of premiums  and  accretion of
discounts,  using a method that approximates  level yield. The amortized cost of
debt  securities  classified  as  HTM or AFS is  adjusted  for  amortization  of
premiums and accretion of discounts to the earlier of call date or maturity,  or
in the  case of  mortgage-related  securities,  over the  estimated  life of the
security.  Such  amortization  and accretion is included in interest income from
the related security. AFS and trading securities are reported at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses,  net of related deferred income taxes,  included in
stockholders'  equity or  income,  respectively.  Realized  securities  gains or
losses and declines in value judged to be other than  temporary  are included in
investment  securities  gains (losses),  net in the  consolidated  statements of
income.  The cost of  securities  sold is based on the  specific  identification
method. Any security for which there has been other than temporary impairment of
value is  written  down to its  estimated  market  value  through  a  charge  to
earnings.

LOANS

Loans and leases are carried at the  principal  amount  outstanding,  net of any
unearned income. Unearned income, primarily from direct leases, is recognized on
a basis that generally  approximates a level yield on the  outstanding  balances
receivable.  Interest  on all other  loans is based  upon the  principal  amount
outstanding.
                                       44
<PAGE>

Loans are normally placed on nonaccrual  status when  contractually  past due 90
days  or more as to  interest  or  principal  payments.  Additionally,  whenever
management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the
collectibility of principal or interest on loans, it is management's practice to
place such loans on  nonaccrual  status  immediately,  rather than delaying such
action  until  the  loans  become  90 days  past  due.  Previously  accrued  and
uncollected  interest on such loans is  reversed,  amortization  of related loan
fees is  suspended,  and income is  recorded  only to the extent  that  interest
payments are  subsequently  received in cash and a  determination  has been made
that the principal balance of the loan is collectible.  If collectibility of the
principal  is in doubt,  payments  received  are  applied to loan  principal.  A
nonaccrual  loan is returned  to accrual  status  when the  obligation  has been
brought  current  and  the  ultimate  collectibility  of the  total  contractual
principal and interest is no longer in doubt.

Loan origination  fees and certain direct loan  origination  costs are deferred,
and the net amount is amortized over the  contractual  life of the related loans
or over the commitment period as an adjustment of yield.

LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market as determined on
an  aggregate  basis and  generally  consist  of current  production  of certain
fixed-rate first mortgage loans. Holding costs are treated as period costs.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

The allowance for loan losses ("AFLL") is a reserve for estimated credit losses.
Credit losses arise primarily from the loan portfolio. Actual credit losses, net
of recoveries, are deducted from the AFLL. A provision for loan losses, which is
a charge  against  earnings,  is added to  bring  the AFLL to a level  that,  in
management's  judgment,  is adequate to absorb  probable  losses inherent in the
loan portfolio.

The allocation  methodology  applied by the Corporation,  designed to assess the
adequacy of the AFLL,  focuses on changes in the size and  character of the loan
portfolio,  changes  in  levels  of  impaired  and  other  nonperforming  loans,
historical  losses on each  portfolio  category,  the risk  inherent in specific
loans,  concentrations  of loans to specific  borrowers or industries,  existing
economic conditions,  the fair value of underlying collateral, and other factors
which could affect potential credit losses.  Management  continues to target and
maintain  the  AFLL  equal to the  allocation  methodology  plus an  unallocated
portion, as determined by economic conditions,  on the Corporation's  borrowers.
Management  allocates the AFLL by pools of risk.  The business loan  (commercial
mortgage;  commercial,  industrial,  and agricultural;  leases;  and real estate
construction)  allocation is based on a quarterly  review of  individual  loans,
loan types, and industries.  The retail loan (residential mortgage, home equity,
and  consumer)  allocation is based on analysis of  historical  delinquency  and
charge-off  statistics and trends.  Minimum loss factors used by the Corporation
for criticized loan categories are consistent  with  regulatory  agencies.  Loss
factors for  non-criticized  loan  categories are based  primarily on historical
loan loss experience and peer group statistics.

Management,  considering current information and events regarding the borrowers'
ability to repay their  obligations,  considers a loan to be impaired when it is
probable  that the  Corporation  will be  unable  to  collect  all  amounts  due
according to the contractual  terms of the note agreement,  including  principal
and interest.  Management has determined  that  commercial  loans and commercial
real  estate  loans  that  have a  nonaccrual  status  or have had  their  terms
restructured  meet this definition.  Large groups of homogeneous  loans, such as
mortgage  and  consumer  loans  and  leases,  are  collectively   evaluated  for
impairment.  The  amount  of  impairment  is  measured  based  upon  the  loan's
observable  market  price,  the  estimated  fair  value  of the  collateral  for
collateral-dependent  loans,  or  alternatively,  the present  value of expected
future cash flows  discounted at the loan's  effective  interest rate.  Interest
income on impaired loans is recorded when cash is received and only if principal
is considered to be fully collectible.

Management  believes that the AFLL is adequate.  While management uses available
information to recognize  losses on loans,  future  additions to the AFLL may be
necessary  based  on  changes  in  economic  conditions.  In  addition,  various
regulatory  agencies,   as  an  integral  part  of  their  examination  process,
periodically  review the

                                       45
<PAGE>

Corporation's  AFLL.  Such  agencies  may require the  Corporation  to recognize
additions to the AFLL based on their  judgments about  information  available to
them at the time of their examinations.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED

Other real estate owned ("OREO") is included in other assets in the consolidated
balance  sheets and is  comprised  of property  acquired  through a  foreclosure
proceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure,  and loans classified
as  in-substance  foreclosure.  OREO  is  recorded  at  the  lower  of  recorded
investment  in the  loans at the time of  acquisition  or the fair  value of the
properties,  less estimated  selling costs. Any write-down in the carrying value
of a property at the time of  acquisition is charged to the AFLL. Any subsequent
write-downs to reflect current fair market value, as well as gains and losses on
disposition and revenues and expenses  incurred in maintaining  such properties,
are  recorded  directly to the income  statement.  OREO totaled $4.0 million and
$3.7 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Premises and  equipment  are stated at cost less  accumulated  depreciation  and
amortization.  Depreciation and  amortization are computed on the  straight-line
method over the estimated  useful lives of the related assets or the lease term.
Maintenance  and repairs are charged to expense as incurred,  while additions or
major  improvements  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful
lives.  Estimated  useful lives for premises  include periods up to 50 years and
for equipment include periods up to 10 years.

INTANGIBLES

The  excess  of the  purchase  price  over  the  fair  value  of net  assets  of
subsidiaries   acquired   consists   primarily  of  goodwill  and  core  deposit
intangibles that are being amortized on straight-line  and accelerated  methods.
These  intangibles  are  included in other  assets in the  consolidated  balance
sheets.  Goodwill is  amortized  to  operating  expense over periods of 10 to 40
years. Core deposit intangibles are amortized to expense over periods of 7 to 10
years.  The  Corporation  reviews  long-lived  assets and  certain  identifiable
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate
that the carrying  amount of an asset may not be  recoverable,  in which case an
impairment charge would be recorded.

As a result of  acquisitions  during  1999 and 1998,  the  Corporation  recorded
additional   goodwill  of  $79.2  million  and  $11.9   million,   respectively.
Additionally,   in  1999,  the  Corporation  recorded  additional  core  deposit
intangibles of $5.9 million.  Goodwill and deposit base intangibles outstanding,
net of  accumulated  amortization,  at  December  31,  2000 and 1999 was  $106.7
million and $116.6 million, respectively.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

The total cost of loans  originated or purchased is allocated  between loans and
servicing rights based on the relative fair values of each. The servicing rights
capitalized  are  amortized  in  proportion  to and over the period of estimated
servicing income. Capitalized mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs") are included in
other assets.  The value of MSRs is adversely  affected  when mortgage  interest
rates decline and mortgage  loan  prepayments  increase.  Impairment is assessed
using stratifications based on the risk characteristics of the underlying loans,
such as bulk acquisitions versus loan-by-loan,  loan type, and interest rate. To
the extent the carrying  value of the MSRs exceed their fair value,  a valuation
reserve is established.

INCOME TAXES

Amounts  provided  for  income  tax  expense  are based on income  reported  for
financial statement purposes and do not necessarily  represent amounts currently
payable under tax laws.  Deferred  income taxes,  which arise  principally  from
temporary  differences  between the period in which certain  income and expenses
are  recognized for financial  accounting  purposes and the period in which they
affect taxable income, are included in the amounts provided for income taxes.

                                       46
<PAGE>

The  Corporation  files a consolidated  federal income tax return and individual
subsidiary state income tax returns. Accordingly,  amounts equal to tax benefits
of those subsidiaries having taxable federal losses or credits are reimbursed by
other subsidiaries that incur federal tax liabilities.

As part  of  managing  the  Corporation's  interest  rate  risk,  a  variety  of
derivative  financial  instruments  could be used to hedge market  values and to
alter the cash flow characteristics of certain on-balance sheet instruments. The
Corporation has principally used interest rate swaps. The derivative instruments
used to manage  interest rate risk are linked with a specific asset or liability
or a group of related  assets or  liabilities at the inception of the derivative
contract and have a high degree of  correlation  with the related  balance sheet
item  during the hedge  period.  Net  interest  income or expense on  derivative
contracts used for interest rate risk management is recorded in the consolidated
statements  of income as a  component  of interest  income or  interest  expense
depending on the financial instrument to which the swap is designated.  Realized
gains and losses on contracts,  either settled or  terminated,  are deferred and
are  recorded  as either an  adjustment  to the  carrying  value of the  related
on-balance  sheet asset or liability  or in other  assets or other  liabilities.
Deferred  amounts are amortized into interest  income or expense over either the
remaining original life of the derivative instrument or the expected life of the
related asset or liability.  Unrealized  gains or losses on these  contracts are
not recognized on the balance sheet.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

As allowed under Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation," the Corporation measures stock-based
compensation cost in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB Opinion No. 25). The Corporation
has  included  in Note 11 the impact of the fair value of  employee  stock-based
compensation plans on net income and earnings per share on a pro forma basis.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

For  purposes  of the  consolidated  statements  of cash  flows,  cash  and cash
equivalents are considered to include cash and due from banks,  interest-bearing
deposits in other financial institutions,  and federal funds sold. Cash and cash
equivalents  were $396.5  million and $314.2  million at December 31, 2000,  and
December 31, 1999, respectively.

PER SHARE COMPUTATIONS

Basic  earnings  per share is  calculated  by dividing  net income  available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted  earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares adjusted for the dilutive  effect of outstanding  stock
options. See also Notes 11 and 18.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as
amended by SFAS No. 137,  "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133," and SFAS
No. 138,  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments  and Certain Hedging
Activities,"  (collectively referred to as "SFAS No. 133" or as the "statement")
requires derivative  instruments,  including derivative  instruments embedded in
other contracts, to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet. The statement
continues to allow derivative  instruments to be used to hedge various risks and
sets forth specific  criteria to be used to determine when hedge  accounting can
be used.  For fair value  hedges,  the statement  also  provides for  offsetting
changes in fair value of both the  derivative  and the hedged asset or liability
to be recognized in earnings in the same period.  For cash flow hedges, the fair
value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income, to the extent
it is  effective.  Any  changes  in fair value or cash flow that  represent  the
ineffective  portion of a hedge are  required to be  recognized  in earnings and
cannot be

                                       47
<PAGE>

deferred.  For derivative  instruments  not accounted for as hedges,  changes in
fair value are required to be recognized in earnings.

The Corporation adopted the provisions of the statement, as required,  beginning
January 1, 2001. The predominant  activities  affected by the statement  include
the  Corporation's  use of  interest  rate swaps and  certain  mortgage  banking
activities.  The  interest  rate  swaps  disclosed  in Note 14 of the  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  were  redesignated  on January 1, 2001, and
qualify  for  hedge  accounting.   In  addition,  the  Corporation  enters  into
commitments to sell groups of  residential  mortgage loans that it originates or
purchases as part of its mortgage  banking  business,  as well as commitments to
originate  loans.  Both the  commitments to sell, as well as the  commitments to
originate  loans, are considered  derivatives  under SFAS No. 133, and beginning
January 1, 2001,  are carried at fair value on the  consolidated  balance sheet,
with changes in fair value  recognized in earnings.  Further,  as allowed by the
statement,  the Corporation transferred all HTM investment securities to the AFS
category,  effective January 1, 2001. Given the derivatives  existing at January
1,  2001,  the impact of  adopting  the  provisions  of this  statement  was not
material on the Corporation's financial position or results of operations.

The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  continues  to  issue  interpretive
guidance  which could require  changes in the  Corporation's  application of the
statement or adjustments to transition  amounts.  SFAS No. 133 as applied to the
Corporation's  risk management  strategies may increase or decrease reported net
income and  stockholders'  equity  prospectively,  depending on future levels of
interest  rates and other  variables  affecting  the fair  values of  derivative
instruments and hedged items,  but will have no effect on cash flows or economic
risk.

SFAS No. 140,  "Accounting  for Transfers and Servicing of Financial  Assets and
Extinguishments  of  Liabilities,"   replaces  SFAS  No.  125,  "Accounting  for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,"
and rescinds SFAS No. 127, "Deferral of the Effective Date of Certain Provisions
of SFAS No.  125." The  statement  revises  the  standards  for  accounting  for
securitizations  and other  transfers of financial  assets and requires  certain
disclosures,  but it also  carries over most of the  provisions  of SFAS No. 125
without modification.  The statement provides accounting and reporting standards
for  transfers  and  servicing  of  financial  assets  and   extinguishments  of
liabilities  based on the  application of a financial  components  approach that
focuses on control.  It is effective for transactions  occurring after March 31,
2001. Certain  disclosures about  securitizations  are effective on December 31,
2000. The adoption is not expected to be material to the Corporation's financial
position or results of operations.

The  Corporation  serves the credit  needs of its  customers  by offering a wide
variety of loan programs to customers,  primarily in  Wisconsin,  Illinois,  and
Minnesota.  The loan  portfolio  is widely  diversified  by types of  borrowers,
industry  groups,  and  market  areas.   Significant  loan   concentrations  are
considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to
a multiple  number of borrowers  engaged in similar  activities that would cause
them to be similarly  impacted by economic or other conditions.  At December 31,
2000, no concentrations existed in the Corporation's loan portfolio in excess of
10% of total loans.

The short-term FHLB advances are secured by blanket collateral agreements on the
subsidiary  banks' mortgage loan  portfolios  whereby  qualifying  mortgages (as
defined) with unpaid  principal  balances  aggregating  no less than 167% of the
FHLB advances are maintained.

Included in short-term  borrowings are FHLB advances with original maturities of
less than one year and callable  notes that have one-year call  premiums,  which
the  Corporation  expects  may be  called,  even if the  notes  have  maturities
exceeding one year.

Notes payable to banks are unsecured  borrowings under existing lines of credit.
At December 31, 2000, the parent  company had $200 million of established  lines
of  credit  with  various  nonaffiliated  banks,  of  which  $83.7  million  was
outstanding.  Borrowings under these lines accrue interest at short-term  market
rates and are payable upon demand or in maturities up to 90 days. During 2000, a
$200 million commercial paper program was initiated,  of which $34.3 million was
outstanding at December 31, 2000.

NOTE 11 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:

On June 15, 2000, the Corporation distributed 6.3 million shares of common stock
in connection  with a 10% stock dividend.  During 1999, the  Corporation  issued
shares in conjunction  with merger and  acquisition  activity (see Note 2 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, on June 12, 1998, the
Corporation distributed 12.7 million shares of common stock in connection with a
5-for-4  stock  split  effected

                                       55
<PAGE>

in the form of a 25%  stock  dividend.  Share  and  price  information  has been
adjusted to reflect all stock splits and dividends.

The  Corporation's  Articles of Incorporation  authorize the issuance of 750,000
shares of preferred stock at a par value of $1.00 per share. No shares have been
issued.

At December 31, 2000,  subsidiary  net assets  equaled  $1.0  billion,  of which
approximately $148.5 million could be transferred to the Corporation in the form
of cash  dividends  without prior  regulatory  approval,  subject to the capital
needs of each subsidiary.

The BOD has  authorized  management  to repurchase  shares of the  Corporation's
common stock each quarter in the market,  to be made  available  for issuance in
connection  with  the  Corporation's  employee  incentive  plans  and for  other
corporate  purposes.  The BOD  authorized  the  repurchase  of up to 1.3 million
shares (330,000  shares per quarter) in 2000 and 1999. Of these  authorizations,
approximately  418,000  shares were  repurchased  for $10.6 million  during 2000
(with 322,000 shares reissued in connection with stock options  exercised),  and
429,000 shares were  repurchased  for $13.6 million in 1999 (with 277,000 shares
reissued for 1999 options exercised). In March 2000, the BOD also authorized the
repurchase and cancellation of up to 5% of the Corporation's outstanding shares,
not to exceed approximately 3.5 million shares. Under this authorization through
December 31, 2000, 3.3 million shares were  repurchased and retired at a cost of
$81.9  million.   In  October  2000,  the  BOD  authorized  the  repurchase  and
cancellation of an additional 3.2 million shares. The repurchase of shares under
this  authorization is expected to begin after  repurchases under the March 2000
authorization  are  completed.  The repurchase of shares will be based on market
opportunities,   capital  levels,   growth   prospects,   and  other  investment
opportunities.

The BOD  approved  the  implementation  of a  broad-based  stock  option  grant,
effective  July 28,  1999.  This stock  option  grant  provided  all  qualifying
employees with an opportunity  and an incentive to buy shares of the Corporation
and align their financial interest with the growth in value of the Corporation's
shares.  These  options have 10-year  terms,  fully vest in two years,  and have
exercise  prices  equal to 100% of  market  value on the  date of  grant.  As of
December 31, 2000, 1,567,000 shares remain available for granting.

The Amended and  Restated  Long-Term  Incentive  Stock Plan  ("Stock  Plan") was
adopted by the BOD and originally  approved by  shareholders in 1987 and amended
in 1994, 1997, and 1998.  Options are generally  exercisable up to 10 years from
the date of grant and vest over two to three  years.  As of December  31,  2000,
approximately 1,701,000 shares remain available for grants.

The  stock  incentive  plans  of  acquired  companies  were  terminated  at each
respective   merger  date.   Option   holders  under  such  plans  received  the
Corporation's  common stock, or options to buy the  Corporation's  common stock,
based on the conversion terms of the various merger  agreements.  The historical
option  information  presented  below has been  restated  to reflect the options
originally granted under the acquired companies' plans.

For purposes of providing the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123,
the fair value of stock options granted in 1998, 1999, and 2000 was estimated at
the  date  of  grant  using a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  which  was
originally  developed  for use in  estimating  the fair value of traded  options
which have  different  characteristics  from the  Corporation's  employee  stock
options.  The model is also sensitive to changes in the  subjective  assumptions
which can materially  affect the fair value  estimate.  As a result,  management
believes the Black-Scholes  model may not necessarily  provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of employee stock options.

The following  assumptions  were used in  estimating  the fair value for options
granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998:

                                           2000           1999           1998
                                         --------------------------------------
Dividend yield                             3.82%          3.39%          3.39%
Risk-free interest rate                    6.63%          4.97%          5.61%
Weighted average expected life             7 yrs.         5.50 yrs.      7 yrs.
Expected volatility                       25.73%         24.51%         21.95%

The weighted average per share fair values of options granted in 2000, 1999, and
1998 were $6.97, $6.90, and $8.28,  respectively.  The annual expense allocation
methodology  prescribed  by SFAS No. 123  attributes a higher  percentage of the
reported  expense  to  earlier  years  than  to  later  years,  resulting  in an
accelerated expense recognition for pro forma disclosure purposes.

Had the Corporation  determined the compensation cost based on the fair value at
grant date for its stock  options  under SFAS No.  123,  the  Corporation's  net
income and net income per share would have been as summarized below:

NOTE 12 RETIREMENT PLAN:

The  Corporation  has a  noncontributory  defined  benefit  retirement plan (the
"Plan") covering  substantially all full-time employees.  The benefits are based
primarily  on years of  service  and the  employee's  compensation

                                       57

Components  of the 1999  deferred  tax assets have been  adjusted to reflect the
filing of corporate income tax returns.

For financial reporting  purposes,  a valuation allowance has been recognized to
offset deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss  carryforwards of
certain subsidiaries and other temporary differences due to the uncertainty that
the assets will be  realized.  If it is  subsequently  determined  that all or a
portion of these
                                       59
<PAGE>

deferred  tax assets will be  realized,  the tax benefit for these items will be
used to reduce current tax expense for that period.

At December 31, 2000, the Corporation  had net operating  losses of $120 million
that will expire in the years 2001 through 2014.

The effective  income tax rate differs from the statutory  federal tax rate. The
major reasons for this difference are as follows:

A savings bank acquired by the Corporation in 1997 qualified under provisions of
the  Internal  Revenue Code that  permitted it to deduct from taxable  income an
allowance for bad debts that differed from the provision for such losses charged
to income for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, no provision for income
taxes has been made for $79.2  million of retained  income at December 31, 2000.
If income taxes had been  provided,  the deferred tax liability  would have been
approximately $31.8 million.

NOTE 14  COMMITMENTS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES:

COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

The Corporation is a party to financial  instruments with off-balance sheet risk
in the normal  course of business to meet the  financing  needs of its customers
and  to  manage  its  own  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk.  These  financial
instruments include lending-related commitments and interest rate swaps.

LENDING-RELATED COMMITMENTS

Off-balance  sheet  lending-related  commitments  include  commitments to extend
credit,  commercial letters of credit,  and standby letters of credit.  With the
exception of commitments  to originate  residential  mortgage  loans  (discussed
below),  these  financial   instruments  are  exercisable  at  the  market  rate
prevailing at the date the underlying transaction will be completed and thus are
deemed to have no current fair value,  or the fair value based on fees currently
charged to enter into  similar  agreements  is not material at December 31, 2000
and 1999.  Commitments  to extend credit are  agreements to lend to customers at
predetermined  interest  rates as long as there is no violation of any condition
established  in the  contracts.  Standby  and  commercial  letters of credit are
conditional  commitments  issued by the Corporation to guarantee the performance
and/or  payment of a customer  to a third  party in  connection  with  specified
transactions.  The following is a summary of  lending-related  off-balance sheet
financial instruments at December 31:

                                                         2000           1999
                                                     --------------- ----------
                                                          ($ IN THOUSANDS)

Commitments to extend credit                         $2,596,438     $3,165,411
Commercial letters of credit                             45,248         26,666
Standby letters of credit                               145,321        147,864
Loans sold with recourse                                  4,575          7,851
Forward commitments to sell loans                        52,350         17,559

For  commitments to extend  credit,  commercial  letters of credit,  and standby
letters of credit,  the Corporation's  associated credit risk is essentially the
same as that  involved in extending  loans to customers and is

                                       60
<PAGE>

subject to normal credit policies.  The Corporation's exposure to credit loss in
the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is
represented by the  contractual  amount of those  instruments.  The  commitments
generally  have fixed  expiration  dates or other  termination  clauses  and may
require  payment of a fee.  The  Corporation  uses the same  credit  policies in
making commitments and conditional  obligations as it does for  on-balance-sheet
instruments.  The Corporation  evaluates each customer's  creditworthiness  on a
case-by-case  basis. The amount of collateral  obtained,  if deemed necessary by
the  Corporation  upon  extension  of credit,  is based on  management's  credit
evaluation of the customer. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire
without  being  drawn  upon,  the total  commitment  amounts do not  necessarily
represent future cash requirements.

All loans  currently  sold to others  are sold on a  nonrecourse  basis with the
servicing  rights of these loans  retained by the  Corporation.  At December 31,
2000 and 1999,  $4.6  million and $7.9  million,  respectively,  of the serviced
loans  were  previously  sold with  recourse,  the  majority  of which is either
federally-insured or federally-guaranteed.

Included  in  commitments   to  extend  credit  are   commitments  to  originate
residential  mortgage loans held for sale  ("pipeline  loans") of  approximately
$55.2  million and $18.9  million at December  31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,
with terms  generally  not  exceeding 90 days.  Also,  the  Corporation  had $25
million  and $12  million  of  mortgage  loans  held for sale  ("MLHFS")  in the
consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Adverse
market  interest rate changes  between the time a customer  receives a rate-lock
commitment  and the time the loan is sold to an investor  can erode the value of
that  mortgage.  Therefore,  the  Corporation  uses forward  commitments to sell
residential  mortgage loans to reduce its exposure to market risk resulting from
changes in interest rates which could alter the  underlying  fair value of MLHFS
and pipeline loans. The MLHFS are carried in the  consolidated  balance sheet at
lower of cost or fair  value,  with  fair  value  determined  based on the fixed
prices of the forward commitments, or quoted market prices on uncommitted MLHFS.
The fair value of the pipeline loans and the forward  commitments on a net basis
at December 31, 2000 and 1999, was $12,000 and $68,000, respectively.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS

As part  of  managing  the  Corporation's  interest  rate  risk,  a  variety  of
derivative  financial  instruments  could be used to hedge market  values and to
alter the cash flow characteristics of certain on-balance sheet instruments. The
Corporation has principally  used interest rate swaps. In these swap agreements,
the  Corporation  agrees to exchange,  at specified  intervals,  the  difference
between  fixed-  and  floating-interest  amounts  calculated  on an  agreed-upon
notional  principal  amount.  Pay fixed  interest rate swaps are used to convert
fixed rate  assets  into  synthetic  variable  rate  instruments  and to convert
variable rate funding sources into synthetic fixed rate funding instruments. Pay
variable  interest  rate swaps are used to convert  variable  rate  assets  into
synthetic fixed rate  instruments and to convert fixed rate funding sources into
synthetic variable rate funding instruments.

Associated's  interest rate swaps at December 31, 2000 and 1999,  are summarized
below.  The effect on net  interest  income was an increase of $311,000 for 2000
and a decrease of  $148,000  for 1999.  The pay fixed  swaps hedge money  market
deposits and the receive rate is based on 3 month LIBOR.  The pay variable swaps
hedge certificates of deposit and the pay rate is based on 3 month LIBOR.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

There  are  legal  proceedings  pending  against  certain  subsidiaries  of  the
Corporation in the ordinary  course of their  business.  Although  litigation is
subject to many  uncertainties  and the ultimate  exposure with respect to

                                       61
<PAGE>

these matters cannot be ascertained, management believes, based upon discussions
with counsel,  that the Corporation has meritorious  defenses,  and any ultimate
liability would not have a material adverse affect on the consolidated financial
position or results of operations of the Corporation.

</TABLE>

At  December  31,  2000 and  1999,  the  notional  amount of  off-balance  sheet
instruments  was $310 million and $300 million,  respectively,  of interest rate
swap   agreements.   See  Note  14  for   information   on  the  fair  value  of
lending-related off-balance sheet financial instruments.

CASH  AND  DUE  FROM  BANKS,   INTEREST-BEARING   DEPOSITS  IN  OTHER  FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS,  FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND SECURITIES  PURCHASED UNDER  AGREEMENTS TO
RESELL, AND ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE - For these short-term instruments,  the
carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

INVESTMENT  SECURITIES  HELD TO MATURITY,  INVESTMENT  SECURITIES  AVAILABLE FOR
SALE, AND TRADING ACCOUNT  SECURITIES - The fair value of investment  securities
held to maturity,  investment securities available for sale, and trading account
securities, except certain state and municipal securities, is estimated based on
bid prices  published in financial  newspapers or bid  quotations  received from
securities dealers.  The fair value of certain state and municipal securities is
not readily  available through market sources other than dealer  quotations,  so
fair value  estimates are based on quoted market prices of similar  instruments,
adjusted for  differences  between the quoted  instruments  and the  instruments
being valued.  There were no trading account  securities at December 31, 2000 or
1999.

LOANS  HELD  FOR  SALE -  Fair  value  is  estimated  using  the  prices  of the
Corporation's  existing  commitments to sell such loans and/or the quoted market
prices for commitments to sell similar loans.

LOANS - Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial
characteristics.  Loans are  segregated by type such as  commercial,  commercial
real estate,  residential  mortgage,  credit card, and other consumer.  The fair
value of other types of loans is estimated by discounting  the future cash flows
using the current rates at which  similar loans would be made to borrowers  with
similar  credit ratings and for similar  maturities.  Future cash flows are also
adjusted for estimated  reductions or delays due to delinquencies,  nonaccruals,
or potential charge-offs.

DEPOSITS  - The  fair  value  of  deposits  with  no  stated  maturity  such  as
noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings,  interest-bearing demand deposits,
and  money  market  accounts,  is equal to the  amount  payable  on

                                       64
<PAGE>

demand as of December 31. The fair value of  certificates of deposit is based on
the discounted  value of contractual  cash flows. The discount rate is estimated
using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

ACCRUED  INTEREST  PAYABLE  AND  SHORT-TERM  BORROWINGS  - For these  short-term
instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

LONG-TERM  DEBT - Rates  currently  available to the  Corporation  for debt with
similar  terms and  remaining  maturities  are used to  estimate  fair  value of
existing borrowings.

INTEREST RATE SWAP  AGREEMENTS - The fair value of interest rate swap agreements
is obtained from dealer quotes.  These values represent the estimated amount the
Corporation  would  receive or pay to  terminate  the  agreements,  taking  into
account   current   interest   rates  and,   when   appropriate,   the   current
creditworthiness of the counter-parties.

LIMITATIONS - Fair value  estimates are made at a specific point in time,  based
on relevant market  information and information about the financial  instrument.
These  estimates  do not reflect any premium or discount  that could result from
offering for sale at one time the Corporation's  entire holdings of a particular
financial instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of the
Corporation's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments
regarding future expected loss experience,  current  economic  conditions,  risk
characteristics  of various  financial  instruments,  and other  factors.  These
estimates  are  subjective  in nature and involve  uncertainties  and matters of
significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.  Changes
in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

NOTE 17   REGULATORY MATTERS:

The  Corporation  and the  subsidiary  banks are  subject to various  regulatory
capital  requirements  administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to
meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain  mandatory--and  possibly
additional  discretionary--actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have
a direct  material  effect  on the  Corporation's  financial  statements.  Under
capital adequacy  guidelines and the regulatory  framework for prompt corrective
action,  the  Corporation  must meet specific  capital  guidelines  that involve
quantitative  measures of the  Corporation's  assets,  liabilities,  and certain
off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The
Corporation's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative
judgments  by the  regulators  about  components,  risk  weightings,  and  other
factors.

Quantitative  measures  established  by  regulation to ensure  capital  adequacy
require the Corporation to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the
table  below) of total and Tier I capital  (as  defined in the  regulations)  to
risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier I capital (as defined) to average
assets (as  defined).  Management  believes,  as of December 31, 2000,  that the
Corporation and the subsidiary banks meet all capital  adequacy  requirements to
which they are subject.

As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the most recent  notifications from the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
categorized  the  subsidiary  banks as well  capitalized  under  the  regulatory
framework for prompt  corrective  action.  To be categorized as well capitalized
the subsidiary banks must maintain minimum total risk-based,  Tier I risk-based,
and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or
events  since that  notification  that  management  believes  have  changed  the
institutions' category.

The actual capital  amounts and ratios of the  Corporation  and its  significant
subsidiaries  are  presented  below.  No  deductions  from capital were made for
interest rate risk in 2000 or 1999.

NOTE 19  SEGMENT REPORTING

SFAS  No.  131,  "Disclosures  About  Segments  of  an  Enterprise  and  Related
Information,"  requires  selected  financial and descriptive  information  about
reportable  operating  segments.  The statement  replaces the "industry segment"
concept  of SFAS No. 14 with a  "management  approach"  concept as the basis for
identifying  reportable  segments.  The management  approach is based on the way
that  management  organizes  the  segments  within  the  enterprise  for  making
operating   decisions,   allocating   resources,   and  assessing   performance.
Consequently,  the segments are evident from the  structure of the  enterprise's
internal  organization,  focusing on financial  information that an enterprise's
chief operating  decision-makers  use to make decisions  about the  enterprise's
operating matters.

While the Corporation  continues developing a process toward evaluating business
lines  and  products   across  its   subsidiaries   through   2000,   management
decision-making has been and is still strongly based on financial information by
legal entity.  The Corporation has managed itself as a multibank holding company
with a super community banking  philosophy.  Each banking entity is empowered to
make  decisions  that are  appropriate  for its  customers  and for the business
environment of its communities.

The Corporation's  reportable segment is banking.  The Corporation  conducts its
banking segment through its bank, leasing,  mortgage,  insurance,  and brokerage
subsidiaries.  For purposes of segment  disclosure  under this statement,  these
entities have been combined as one, given these  segments have similar  economic
characteristics  and  the  nature  of  their  products,   services,   processes,
customers,  delivery channels, and regulatory  environment are similar.  Banking
includes:  a) business  banking - small  business  and other  business  lending,
investment management,  leasing, business deposits, and a complement of services
such as cash management,  insurance,  and international  banking;  and b) retail
banking - consumer,  mortgage,  and other real  estate  lending,  credit  cards,
insurance, brokerage, and deposits.

The "other" segment is comprised of smaller  nonreportable  segments,  including
asset management,  consumer finance, treasury,  holding company investments,  as
well  as  inter-segment   eliminations  and  residual   revenues  and  expenses,
representing  the difference  between  actual  amounts  incurred and the amounts
allocated to operating segments.

The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note
1. Selected segment information is presented below.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
ASSOCIATED BANC-CORP

The Board of Directors
Associated Banc-Corp:


We have  audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of  Associated
Banc-Corp  and  subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,  and the related
consolidated  statements of income,  changes in stockholders'  equity,  and cash
flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period ended  December 31, 2000.
These  consolidated  financial  statements are the  responsibility of Associated
Banc-Corp's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Associated Banc-Corp
and  subsidiaries  as of December  31,  2000 and 1999,  and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the  three-year  period
ended  December 31, 2000 in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America.
